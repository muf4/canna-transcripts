[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeder Cynicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_03]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_03]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie
[SPEAKER_03]: Natsodon, Breeder and Grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_03]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome Breeder Cynicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with my buddy Kendo.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is an old school forum member,
old school breeder, old school grower,
[SPEAKER_03]: and anything else I'm forgetting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, just uh, you named it off,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Martial art is badass.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's an old school truth teller,
is the best way that I could explain this.
[SPEAKER_03]: An old school critical thinker from the
forums and an old school truth teller,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's an honor to have him here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been wanting to get him for a long
time, and I think you guys will enjoy
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll start it off now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, just talking about the
pre-forum days, you know, when I was like
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 years old, I did my first grows up in
the hills above San Jose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, at that point,
I had learned how to grow pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I had no idea, you know, what I was
growing and any of that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went up to Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this underground record store,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What years are we talking?
[SPEAKER_01]: 1975.
[SPEAKER_03]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
75.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But me and a buddy went up to this
underground record store in Berkeley,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they had this little, or a group of
these little cliff notes, hippie gorilla
[SPEAKER_01]: grow guides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was just like this, like five inches
by four inches, maybe 20 pages that a
[SPEAKER_01]: hippie had put together that, you know,
described essentially how to set up a
[SPEAKER_01]: gorilla grow guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it the old cultivators book with a
little girl watering can on the front?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was, this was just like with the,
you know, like some, some art paper and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was, it was just, it was, it was crude,
but it was really helpful, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I found a spot,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some seeds, found a good spot that
was in a dry wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the soil was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a, it had a spring sped little,
little runoff above, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had water that I could bring down and
everything turned out good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a, it was really beneficial that it
was a long hot summer because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, again, you know, I didn't,
I didn't know much about strains at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had grown some, some Maui and
some Colombian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're talking long, long-term
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love flowering, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they weren't, they weren't ready until
almost the end of November, but we only
[SPEAKER_01]: saw two rains during that entire time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lucky as hell.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I didn't even know how lucky I
was until much later, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it turned out beautiful, really,
really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got it, I got it all down,
got it all transported because it was way
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the mountains, way back in the
hills, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was all, you know, packing it
myself, packing in the dirt myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, at that point, man,
you know, pretty much all we saw was,
[SPEAKER_01]: was, you know, brickweed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some good Colombian, some
different stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, for the most part, it was all
just with seeds and shake and yada,
[SPEAKER_01]: yada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I made a splash in my
neighborhood, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a couple of guys, my brother's,
my brother was older, like eight years
[SPEAKER_01]: older.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had some friends that were growing
and, you know, it was, it was really,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, good for me to take my weed to
them, smoking with them, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were, they were talking about how
good it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the Kendo name for a long time
because of my martial arts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the one guy, they called him the
doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, man, this is some green
wizard shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the name just stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: From then on, you know, I was known as
Kendo the green wizard.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that girl turned out really
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, over the years after
that, I would, you know, go on back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: mountains, pack my dirt in, you know,
grow my plants, do my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, back then I didn't tell
anybody I was growing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody wanted some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, yeah, I can get you
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go to the guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me your money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then bring back my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it worked out well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked out really, really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good, good little, little story from
those days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was I was back in this, in this park.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a state park or county park.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had miles and miles of trails.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went way back down this trail,
got off of the county land into some other
[SPEAKER_01]: land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was some, some, some brush and
some trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I would do like six
plants in each area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a spot and I had six plants
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always had an alternative way to
walk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never walk directly to my grill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I walked and it was up above the site.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, you know, maybe, maybe a hundred
feet up above the site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sitting up there in this little
spot, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having my lunch, looking down and I
see some movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking maybe it's, you know,
a deer or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody, some dude gets up from where he
was hiding goes and obviously goes and
[SPEAKER_01]: takes a leak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And comes back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I see somebody else, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to be all stealthy in the bushes
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, cops, obviously cops,
man, cause they're hiding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, well, fuck this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I stashed what I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my backpack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stashed everything that I had that was
grow related.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some duct tape, some scissors,
you know, some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stashed all that and then walked back
around my little trail, got on the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: trail and started going back to where I
was going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of walking fast, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was walking fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I keep looking back,
keep looking back and I see them coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, fuck, I'm fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I going to do, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm all nervous, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, this is back, this is back
in the day when, you know, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking prison, man, for that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm all nervous, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, bro, I had to take shit.
Literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get the nervous shit, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rumbling, bumbling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, no, if I keep going,
I'm going to shit myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just stepped off the path a little
bit, man, in the bushes, drop my,
[SPEAKER_01]: my hikers, my hiker shit target,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you know about those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I drop it down, drop my pants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start taking a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, maybe two minutes later,
maybe less, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys go by and they, they pass me up
and then stop and come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, put your hands up, put your hands up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, I'm sitting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your hands up, put your hands up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, if I put my hands up,
I'm going to fall down, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, look, she sees that I'm
actually taking a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, well, well, well,
finish up then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hurry up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Move slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, all right, man, no problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wipe, you know what, pull the target
together, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you got the little strings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make a little, little container out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little shit container.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little poop container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the guys, the guys like,
come over this way slowly, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that your backpack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, that's my backpack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then he tells me, let me see your
hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I ain't getting poop on my
hands, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your hands, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because back then we all use the blue
stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the 10 52 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're mixing up, if you're fucking
with it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit would stain the shit out of your
hands, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's looking at my hands, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got no blue on my hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got no poop on my hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, bro, I'm hiking.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, we didn't see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were back over so and so, such and
such.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, well, I only went so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw that that was the end of the
trail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I turned around and started walking
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, well, you know, this is,
this is a dangerous place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, danger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know there's mountain lions and
such out here, but you know, danger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what are you guys after?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're, we're, we're looking for some
illegal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got to be careful because those
are the illegal marijuana growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can set up some movie traps and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, I hate those fucking
marijuana growers, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go on, go on down the trail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't come back this way again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know that we're about to ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, all right, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry to mess up your, your,
your investigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm walking away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm laughing, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just laughing my ass off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost those plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had three, I had three more spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was, that was some funny shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the old, um, the old thing like
plant one for you, plant one for thieves,
[SPEAKER_03]: plant one for cops type deal.
Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was also plant, plant another one
for the wildlife.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got rabbits and deers and rabbits
and kangaroo rats and you name it,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were taking it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, I would take a chicken wire and I
would make a basket.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the basket would be two feet
above the soil line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you've got a basket that's like two
and a half feet down into your hole that
[SPEAKER_01]: you dug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got it two feet up above and
I would take it and you know, you always,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would always take off the bottom
branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's just grow 101 and,
uh, you know, then fold it in a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: so that it was maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, eight to 10 inches around,
around the, the, uh, the main stem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that stops rabbits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stops kangaroo rats.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stops gophers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not going to stop the deer,
but yeah, those fuckers girdle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they, they, they strip the bottom
base of your plants for people that don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know, like rats will just strip it and
they do it once and it'll kill the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: plant instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they do that on purpose because they
want to knock the plan over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that why they can only reach,
they can only reach so many of the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: down low.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize that I was like,
why did they always just target that base
[SPEAKER_03]: socks?
[SPEAKER_01]: They want, they want to knock it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they eat all the leaves off of
it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking rabbits, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, you know, it was a,
it was, it was an adventure, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know if you've ever seen
brown dirt warrior.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a guy from Canada and he did a
bunch of, uh, he did a bunch of videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where he would, um, he would go out and
show people how he was gorilla growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he'd have like two big bags of,
uh, of sunshine mix on each shoulder and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, hike his way five, 10 miles into
the bush and blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I mean, that's really what
it's like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's literally what it's like,
you know, and I got some art work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would let my, I would let my,
my sunshine mix dry the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be like, so it'd be like, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, in the beginning it's 20
pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it lighten up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like five pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course you got to, you got to
moisten the shit out of it afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would just cut my bag in half and
then just fill it, fill each half with
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it soak it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do that a couple of times, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now your, your Pete and all your
forest product is all, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: nice and hydrated again.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's actually really good advice
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not many people are growing
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a lot of people who watch the
show do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is good advice, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, once you get out,
once you get back there, man, it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's, it's easy to hydrate it
and it's just impossible to get it back
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I did a lot of,
I did a lot of crazy different gorilla
[SPEAKER_01]: girls, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did some that were, you know,
all the way up on the top of a ridge with
[SPEAKER_01]: the water sources was down at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I do is I just took old water
beds and took them to the top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: ridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would get down below and I had
a, an OG foot pump that I hooked up to a
[SPEAKER_01]: bicycle pedals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would just sit down and just,
you know, and peddling and fill everything
[SPEAKER_01]: up, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill it all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked out well.
[SPEAKER_03]: The water beds, because there was a,
I don't know if you know, Mad Jag,
[SPEAKER_03]: he used to be on the forums, I see Mag and
he was an old rower back in the day,
[SPEAKER_03]: gorilla grower in the late seventies did
the first big skunk one grows that he gave
[SPEAKER_03]: me this old, his old catalog.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was for gorilla growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was from the late seventies,
early eighties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had these big inflatable like,
like basically water bed innards that you
[SPEAKER_03]: would fill up with water for a gorilla
growing, but water bed is perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just pump it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would just cover them with
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover the water beds with leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would grow, I would grow down
the backside, the south facing side of
[SPEAKER_01]: these ridges, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, it was, I was grown in
an area that had a decent amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: hunters.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if, you know, if the incline is as
such, you don't have to worry about
[SPEAKER_01]: hunters going down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to go around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, I mean, the incline on this,
this particular spot that I was doing that
[SPEAKER_01]: at, I would, I would actually tie off a
rope to a tree at the top and then just
[SPEAKER_01]: work my way across.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the different plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it worked out well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is long before we had camp or any of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't have to worry about helicopters
or anybody coming, swooping in on your
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When camp came in, I was actually,
I would get on a south facing hillside and
[SPEAKER_01]: then tuck my plants up underneath the oak
trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, you know, you still get that
south facing, you know, good sunlight on
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants, but they're kind of stealthy
up underneath the oak trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really couldn't, you really
couldn't see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never, you know, I lost the,
I lost a few plants here and there,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to, to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, as I go in, if I saw any
recent tracks or areas that were apparent,
[SPEAKER_01]: that people were moving around in that
area, I would just let them go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not worth it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just not worth the prison time,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people get that greed and think about
all the work and just like, I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: I walk, but that's what keeps people safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you gotta be smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta be smarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't, I wasn't prepared to go to
prison, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, using my instinct and my
intuition, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept myself out of, out of jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned, you mentioned your name
Kendo coming, you know, from a karate
[SPEAKER_03]: background.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real quick, real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell us a little bit about some of
that karate background?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I know people are going to want it,
want me to ask that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first started, man, it was,
I got in a lot of fights.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a kid, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And glasses, you know, I wouldn't take any
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I moved to this little town
called Melpidus, a lot of farm boys who
[SPEAKER_01]: thought they were tough, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they really weren't tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I got in a lot of fights,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Bakersfield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pardon?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Bakersfield, all the farm guys
and yeah, that's how I grew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, my parents put me into
karate in hopes that it would teach me
[SPEAKER_01]: discipline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And restraint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep me from fighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked to a degree, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked to a degree, but it also didn't
work to another degree, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get in trouble anymore,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people were afraid to talk shit
and turn me in, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I started off doing a, I started off
doing Taekwondo, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the Kendo came in,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we would work with the, with Kendo
sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I loved it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was good at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love, I love whipping that shit and
hearing it go crack, crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I got into, what's known as
Kajikimbo with a school called Crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: Dragons.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially, essentially Crazy Dragons
was Cobra Kai.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were Cobra Kai.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They eat bad guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were Cobra Kai.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it was featured on FightQuest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I have, I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a, it's a FightQuest feature,
Kajikimbo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we would learn how to fight 101,
then it was two on one, then three on one,
[SPEAKER_01]: four on one, five on one, all street
fighting, no mercy, no mercy karate.
[SPEAKER_01]: No mercy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kajikimbo is five different arts combined
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was the first mixed martial art and
it was the first American martial art.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out of Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was great, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed the hell out of that shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I'm so far into martial arts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the history that like, this fascinates
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: This part of it fascinates me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I started off as a Shotokan kid
at Way of Japan here with Abelardo,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Sensei.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was a kid, like I got put in the
same, same reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Parents saw me fighting a bunch and
thought, wanted me to have some restraint.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what it taught me was you don't just
unload on everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You unload on those that are assholes and
bigger than you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never fight someone smaller than you,
you know, shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what, that's what the discipline I
learned.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I eventually got kicked out for street
fighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up becoming the bully of the
bullies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure the guys that were bullies,
man, I, I, I take it to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do, because I see that you took that
to the forums too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we venture into there, this is why,
like, I really, for people that don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know, like I have spent a long time on the
forums myself, but Kendo, was on the
[SPEAKER_03]: forums before my time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there, there, throughout the history,
there hasn't been a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_03]: have given pushback to scammers,
the liars, to con artists.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kendo was the pre pre-met, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Long before I existed, Kendo was holding
it down hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really want to go into some of that
too, cause it, it's special moments,
[SPEAKER_03]: important moments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there wasn't a lot of dudes who had
the balls to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's not fun being that person,
but it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, man, being at it for such
a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I was a, I was a web guy in
the eighties before the internet was even
[SPEAKER_01]: created, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was back in the BBS days, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When it was a bulletin board services and
discussion boards, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no gooey.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned how to troll from guys at
that time, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Learning how to troll just with words.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just with words, just to get people going
and get people on edge, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Get them exposed themselves, get them
doing that kind of stuff.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we get into that, let me just
do a little bit more of the pre forum,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, when I was like, uh, somewhere
around 18, man, I met, uh, I met one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Hayes brothers up in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_01]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way back in the day, way, way back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a liking to me, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a, I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was growing some good weed, not great
weed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this RL?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pardon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this RL?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
Okay.
No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wasn't, I mean, there, there was a,
there was a whole group of guys who were
[SPEAKER_01]: part of that crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see the thing behind me, the Hayes
brothers poster.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right up behind me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Art of the quest, art of the quest,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so, you know, I met him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was actually, uh, uh,
kind of, kind of sort of dating,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, this guy's niece, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went up to a picnic and you know,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was all the family there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I busted out some of my weed and
they liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they busted out some of their
weed and I fucking loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, wow, this is, you know,
this is, this is like three steps above my
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the guy took a liking to me and,
uh, I went up and I helped him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I helped him trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: I helped him do some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back in the day, it wasn't the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a California trim, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He was taking, taking the big leaves off
and you know, smaller sugar leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, he took me with him as he went up
to Mendo and humble and, uh, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Trinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I went back, I didn't go all the
way through to spy rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we went back in that, that area and,
uh, you know, a lot of other places and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was, it was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't trim for money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You trimmed for weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would come back with a, you know,
big, you know, contractor bag full of
[SPEAKER_01]: buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: After trimming, which was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause dude, it was 70 fucking 70 bucks for
a quarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was happy, but yeah, so I met that guy
and I went through a lot of other stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, then, uh, uh,
you know, I did my, did my, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: did my gorilla growing for a while and
then Cali medical hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when, when Cali medical hit,
you know, we got some licenses or 2003,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, 95, 95.
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was way back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had been, I had been doing,
you know, the, uh, the, uh, two 15 getting
[SPEAKER_01]: signatures for the two 15 and doing a
bunch of stuff, working with a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: guys, Dale Garlinger, um, some of the
other guys that were, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the leaders of that, that movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it was great, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was real happy to do that,
but I started growing in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was fantastic, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got like four, I got four,
you know, four licenses from other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm growing in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got no worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, I'm not scared of nothing,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing great plants right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fantastic, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, I looked up with some of my
brother's old friends and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were growing out in this area back
behind the Livermore, California.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, California, you know,
but a lot of people don't know California
[SPEAKER_01]: is mainly mainly badlands, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a lot of nothing rattlesnakes,
cougars, you know, a lot of desert,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, a lot of desert, a lot of scrub,
scrub oak, tumbleweeds and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just, it's way, it was way back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This operation was way back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I affectionately call it crazy
crusties cannabis co-op.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and, you know, I did,
I did good back there, man, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, there was some, there was some clowns
growing weed back there, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was, there was one set of
guys, man, you know, I'm not going to name
[SPEAKER_01]: names, but there was one set of guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought growing weed was taken a,
uh, a, uh, post hole digger.
[SPEAKER_01]: You dig out one full post hole spot,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, 16 inches deep and then
dropping a one gallon pot in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was their version of growing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can imagine it was, it was
horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another guy was growing lollipops,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This class of weed, this big around
literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: As white as the pot, man, they can't grow
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just ridiculous, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was funny, dude, but, uh,
I did really, really good up there on
[SPEAKER_01]: that, uh, on that spot and made a bunch of
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the interim, you know, as,
uh, uh, before we even got up there is
[SPEAKER_01]: when I was introduced to Overgrow,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's now we'll start with the forums,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Overgrow was really interesting to me,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, prior to that,
it was, you know, I, I had not had
[SPEAKER_01]: exposure to, you know, just outright
talking about shit online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I started that Overgrow was
like, oh, one 2000 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and, uh, I just looked,
I looked for a little over a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just learning, doing things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, don't want to interact yet,
but like, I think that's a lot of the old
[SPEAKER_03]: school method that you sit down,
you listen, and you learn before you jump
[SPEAKER_03]: in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't look like an ass,
you know, but that's not how most people
[SPEAKER_03]: operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like you said, bro, I started,
I started noticing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: inconsistencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And my gut and intuition was telling me,
you know, this guy's a scammer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This person's scamming.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but I still hadn't started
posting, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So as time went on, I was like,
all right, I'm just going to post some
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I started actually posting on the
political forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I started posting,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, I'm, you know,
me, I'm a political guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't help it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, you know, after I got my leg,
you know, from posting in the political
[SPEAKER_01]: forums, you know, I felt comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I started going after some of
these guys and pointing out that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I thought they were scammers
and, you know, I didn't trust what they
[SPEAKER_01]: were saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point I started getting
blowback from the moderators.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because these guys, well, these guys were,
uh, they had, they had people fooled,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, everybody thought the coolest,
nicest, most friendly guys, or they were
[SPEAKER_01]: people that were so much in need.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, my whole world fell apart and
yada, yada, yada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you know, the forum back then,
everybody wanted to help everybody,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I helped a lot of people,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But a small community, people that cared
about each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when your gut, you know, when your
intuition and your instinct, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sets an alarm off, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I trust that shit big time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would start questioning these guys,
you know, tell me, tell me more,
[SPEAKER_01]: tell me more.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm going to do something for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to explain to me how this came
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not making a lot of sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then people would come back and be,
well, you're a dick, you're a chump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you doing this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad vibes, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that, exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that point now I'm already raising,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Awareness to me being a dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And yada, yada, yada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, all right, whatever,
whatever's clever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, you know, I'm thinking about how
I'm going to shake things up a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: How am I going to shake things up over
here, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I posted up a thread called I pee on my
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Classic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even during my time, I knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking down on my plants and I'm holding
a water bottle out of sight with a hole in
[SPEAKER_01]: the front of it and I'm squirting the
plants down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it looks like I'm actually peeing on
my plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm peeing on your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole premise of the thread was about
how much people were using urea products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urea, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before you knew it, man, it just
started taking off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're disgusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell is your problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never smoke your weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: No fucking way.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just started taking off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just started taking off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the end of that thread,
it had there was only a couple of other
[SPEAKER_01]: threads that were even close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it had the most activity of any thread
on Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thousands and thousands of replies and
comments and, you know, hates and loves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh, yeah, it was a joke, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was some people got it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most people didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then other people just wanted to be
chumps about it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, you know, at that point now,
I'm feeling real comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, fuck it, I'm going to start
commenting on everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just commenting all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm gaining all kinds of people and
friends and doing this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I gained the site of the Sharks Tank.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember the Sharks Tank?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's before my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Sharks Tank was like the spot for
Overgrow where they could send the trolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a place where they could have
uncensored content without having to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they could, you know, they would send
the trolls to the Sharks Tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a lot of guys over there that
were, you know, really good trolls,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they did not.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Juice and a bunch of these other guys who
were over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they took side of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they essentially set me up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And came at me real hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, on Overgrow, they had a
hard moderation policy and I had already,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, gained the attention of a bunch
of the moderators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I started calling people names,
you know, I got banned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got banned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then, you know, I was I was pissed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I was real pissed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I was like, all right,
whatever, man, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I started at Cannabis World and I
rejoined Overgrow as Sir Bud's Alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and then I got a message at
Overgrow from Plural Among Goose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you heard of Plural?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, he snitched on the whole world,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's he was Silk Road.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the guy who taught Silk Road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a message from Plural.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he tells me, here's what's going on at
the shark's tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he sends me this whole thread of these
guys talking hell of shit about how they
[SPEAKER_01]: got me booted and all this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a newbie.
[SPEAKER_01]: He thinks he's a troll.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ain't shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I was like, all right,
watch this, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I created a website called PlayBud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the website, I just started,
you know, posting my thoughts,
[SPEAKER_01]: posting a bunch of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I started one called The Sacking
of Kindle.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on there, I started talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put this stuff up that Plural gave me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Started talking shit about all the
different people at the at the shark's
[SPEAKER_01]: tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one guy, he was like a main
moderator.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name was Mr. Michael.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the main moderator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was one of the one of the guys who
was part of the sacking of Kindle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started talking shit about him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saying a bunch of stuff about him and
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then he goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: By that time, I joined joined the shark's
tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and started talking about it and
started talking to him and calling him,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, calling him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he read this stuff on PlayBud and then
posted up personal information about me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doxed you on the sack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was against policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was that was that was one of
the biggest TLU violations.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the shark's tank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the ultimate troll move to get
someone to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got him banned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the main moderators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not now at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're calling me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're calling me, you know, troll
master.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I created the troll.
[SPEAKER_01]: I created the troll mafia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had like I had like, you know,
40 different personas on the shark's tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I created like 25 on Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would go in and I would start a
thread and then I would post to the thread
[SPEAKER_01]: commenting on what I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would go in and look from
another persona and talk shit about myself
[SPEAKER_01]: in the thread.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then other people coming back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just go on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just would just it was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mental mental jockeying grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so so the shark's tank was a
really good good way for me to to get you
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my wife into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her name was Team Thundercunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got your wife into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I could I would keep telling her all
the different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, you know, I hate it,
but it sounds like a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after that, right, I was posting on the
so then I got Overgrow to allow me to come
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they were hot, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the only person, the only person
ever to be reintroduced to Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started a campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let Kendo back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hell of people that was in their
signature line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let Kendo back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let Kendo back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I literally there ended up being a
couple of thousand of people who did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they let me back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They let me back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, Overgrow is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the IP on my plants was was
probably the the best one that I ever put
[SPEAKER_01]: out there, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a couple of other ones out there,
right, which was one of them was
[SPEAKER_01]: moderation, moderators and the moderated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a it was a vision into what
moderation truly is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: How you moderate people, what you're
supposed to be, what it's supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then about who and what moderators are
supposed to do and about what we saw at
[SPEAKER_01]: Overgrow and at Cannabis World as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That they really weren't moderators.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just ego, ego driven people who,
you know, would go after people they
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't like and, you know, let the people
that they did like get away with whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: they wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how it is, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't change.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was about the moderated,
those of us who are under those policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, bro, that one got that one got a lot
of visualization, a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It opens people's eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people don't even put time into
thinking or understanding the psychology
[SPEAKER_03]: behind it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see and you've seen me,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and, you know, it's funny you say
psychology.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've seen me, you know, I can I can run
circles around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90 percent of these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a game of chess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is like a game of chess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all playing checkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And psychologically, you know,
on on a website, when you're on a website,
[SPEAKER_01]: people are at their keyboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's their own little world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're in their base comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't help but show their base and
who they truly are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very easy to manipulate people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I developed a I developed a means by which
to deal with that shit and post called
[SPEAKER_01]: WebFu.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a it was based on
Schopenhauer's 31 Ways to Win an Argument
[SPEAKER_01]: and Sun, Sun Sews, Art of War.
[SPEAKER_01]: Art of War.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so and it did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works out all the fucking time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are so predictable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make them paint themselves into a corner
and then watch them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can see it right away when
they figure out that they painted
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves into a corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: They start stumbling and start trying to
figure out how to do this and do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that moderation, with that
moderation and the moderated post,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of those moderations
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, you know, get them to,
you know, keep stepping on themselves and
[SPEAKER_01]: be like, well, you say this, but how about
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what you did in this instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and this is what you did in that
instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard for me to be able to see any
difference between this, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you say you're moderating,
you're actually moderating the way that a
[SPEAKER_01]: moderator is supposed to moderate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it by example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So explain to me where you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: That can get dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: That can get dangerous more than people
realize though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I'm not scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not scared of nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just talking about like as far as
people that are snitchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the scary one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, you get snitched on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays you get swatted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, it's horrible with where it's gone
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as I'm concerned, I don't know.
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, cause back in the day,
like sometimes you'd run into these people
[SPEAKER_03]: and you fist fight and that's over.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this other shit is not, that's that,
that's not in our playbook.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have those roles to run that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, they get this dominion.
[SPEAKER_03]: They always have that upper hand that they
can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I, I could tell you,
I had multiple people, you know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: They would, they would confront me because
you know, I've been to lots of different
[SPEAKER_01]: parties, harvest parties, areas,
you know, I mean, we met at that barbecue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do try to confront me there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, I've been confronted
there and it's like, Hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can, we can do whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a couple of guys were pretty damn big.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, dude, I'm, you're not the first guy,
big guy I've ever fought, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean, you can,
you can take it to the limit or we could
[SPEAKER_01]: just say whatever, you know, I'm not gonna
take it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I meant what I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, let's figure this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, from Overgrow, man,
it, uh, and Sharkstank, I met a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people personally, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, cause I would, I would go
ahead and, uh, invite people over,
[SPEAKER_01]: which freaked my wife the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can imagine, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: People coming over, staying on the,
stay on the couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course I'd vet them first.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And find out about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I'd go to their house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd meet up at concerts and, you know,
parties and blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, there were a lot of parties from
Cannabis World that I got involved in.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis World.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk about some of those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pardon?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk about some of those?
[SPEAKER_03]: Any, any good stories from those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Cannabis World was a sister site for,
uh, for Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I think that's where they,
that's actually where they launched,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, Heaven's Stairway from,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Cannabis World.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Richard ran Overgrow and Cannabis World.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was he all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, oh God, it was NL,
was it NL 420 and Fool Girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was a guy named IO,
IO1 maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started, they started Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then once Overgrow started
taking off because it didn't, I think it
[SPEAKER_01]: was like a year, there was 60,000 members
in Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just fucking took off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then they were, um, trying to
finance it by the ads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was so much, so much content,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you got to buy storage space,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to pay for service storage space.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was becoming too prolific and too
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, Fool Girl, um, NL 420 and this
other person stepped away and Calrissian
[SPEAKER_01]: Richard jumped in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Shebang handled the, handled the tech
part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Richard handled their money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they came up with, uh,
they started doing the auction at first
[SPEAKER_01]: and that was, that was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when Subbie, that's when Subbie got
involved.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what was his name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember his Roo?
[SPEAKER_01]: R-U?
[SPEAKER_01]: RC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that his real name or his original
first name was, uh, Richard.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sub cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Subbie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what his Roo or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just always called him Subbie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's when, when he started
doing his thing, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, there was, it was a,
it was just a, a bunch of the 77 crew,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know much about the 77 crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it, like, cause I remember there's
always AE 77 attached to everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that it's part of Eric.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Eric.
[SPEAKER_01]: A-E-R-I-C.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 77 crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he ahead of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or just part of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, he's just part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the 77 crew was just a group of like 77
guys who all had, you know, availability
[SPEAKER_01]: or possession of fuck tons of land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or specific area cultivars, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's call it that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Land race to me, land race to me is a
misnomer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much everything is a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, there was like 77 guys and
they all got together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and just started exchanging genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ Short, Subbie, Eric, Stone Pony,
all those guys, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those hell of them preservation dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stoney Puppet stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Texas Kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Texas Kid, Lone Star.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lone Star's there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of those guys.
Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think Mark Castle was a part of it
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking Marks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think, but he's, he's old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark is cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been around forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forever, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that guy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that guy a lot, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been around a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, you know, it was, um,
it was a lot of, a lot of stuff going on
[SPEAKER_01]: with those guys, um, um, at that point,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When they first started it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was about, it was about the time
that I got in there that, that it started
[SPEAKER_01]: really taking off that they, that,
um, Richard came into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, she bang and him went,
went in together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, yeah, it was, it was really good,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then cannabis world, I started getting
into the cannabis world because cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: world was a lot less caustic than
Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was way more friendly, a lot more
really good people, a lot of good stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I met a bunch of people through
like, uh, Elk Slayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you know.
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I ended up at,
uh, crazy crusty's cannabis co-op,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was very successful for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until, uh, until we got rated by 105 cops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you, and you made it out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All my plants were accounted for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have four that didn't have the right
tags, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they chopped down four of my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of like 70, 70 or 70.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: They chopped down four of my plants,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it was beautiful, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all, you know, five pounders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dude, it was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was all my own stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a preservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's raised the purple block head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all my stuff that I bred,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, let's get back to the parties we
were going to talk about on cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of these parties, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, a really good friend of X,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was Russell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me, let me tell you how I met.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I met, I got, uh, I got the,
um, I got the UK cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was one of the first in the United
States to get the UK cheese.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he brought it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like source.
[SPEAKER_03]: He sourced it somehow, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got it from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he got it from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I got it from, uh, optimist prime.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't, we won't do, we won't do first
names, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got it from optimist prime.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got it from, uh, what was his name?
[SPEAKER_01]: He was out of Canada, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: These, uh, he's an English dude who was up
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vision theater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he sourced it through vapor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vapor got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he was in Nova Scotia and he carried
it all the way across Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: To visions, um, to visions, little commune
over, over NBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so he sent it, vision sent it to
optimist prime and then optimist prime
[SPEAKER_01]: sent me, sent it to me along with the,
uh, vision tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you got to grow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I got the cheese and everybody is
holding that shit tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you, I mean, you, you know,
my reputation, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just started giving it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, uh, Alex layer comes to me and
tells me, Hey bro, you gotta, you gotta
[SPEAKER_01]: get, you gotta let me get that strain,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta let me get that strain and don't
give it to this other guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the other guy, his name was Danimal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh God.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, his name was Daniel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see why you would say don't give
it to Danimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give it to Daniel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you dare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give it to whoever the hell I want
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started doing some research on Danimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, but I, so I gave, gave that
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I, bro, you're the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did research on Danimal and found out
Danimal was a scammer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I meet Danimal up in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going up to Oakland to the third floor
up there, um, on Broadway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to pick up some, uh,
pick up some strains from turtle up there
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, remember turtle?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't know him, but I know the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's bomb, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'm going up there anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have the cheese and I have East
coast sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Early source of that, that sour too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had two separate plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so Danimal starts telling me a
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A story is not even his story,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard the story already from the
person who the story was fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: originated from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right off the bat, I'm like,
fuck you.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all you needed to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: The East coast sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took that back.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He traded this East coast sour diesel to a
bunch of people calling it the cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And got clowned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Came back at me on, on Candice world and
was like, bro, what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, that's East coast sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I go to your dick, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a liar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get clowned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everybody was like, Oh,
that's, that's, that's classic,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he got clowned.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got clowned so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was hella funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we're, we're, we're fast
friends at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, elsewhere, get mad that we're using
his first name.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, probably not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to make sure nobody,
nobody will know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody will know his last name anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting together, doing different
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm, I'm still not in that inner,
inner circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The click.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the main reason is because there's a
couple of Rudy poops who just didn't like
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were mad at you probably from your,
your previous posts about calling people
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're Rudy poops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't like me.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Jake went to Rosso who was having
these Friday night parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, said he wanted to,
he wanted to bring me to the party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Rosso was like, Oh hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Kendall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you bring him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jake said he was going to bring me and
this other guy, Ed, Ed Larkus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't like, he didn't like,
he didn't like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up becoming friends, but he
didn't like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, no, no, you can't bring
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jake was like, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brought me anyway.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I'm there at Rosso's and now
there's a Rosso has a Friday night party
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's a Saturday and Sunday party at
NCGAs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Friday and Saturday and Sunday
party at NCGAs and it's a, it's a meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a big get together,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so, you know, I paid my money to
go there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're having a blast, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some people there, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, you know, that I was happy to meet,
you know, and, and it was, it was all
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the, that was the first year
that I went there, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I met a lot of good people,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of really good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the second year is when things started
getting interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go to, we go to Rosso's party,
you know, it's kind of, it's like a,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a cup, but it's not really a cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knows, everybody knows who
strains or what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this the Nugs and Judges?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we'll talk about Nugs and Judges.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know if that was the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was some ICMAG stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, this is before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, you know, I go to, I go to NCGAs
little harvest party.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that year there was Eddie Lemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and Jack Herrer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who else was?
[SPEAKER_03]: He was probably there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: His wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think DJ Short was there that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who's the guy who did the Canna Bible?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Jason King.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason King.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason King.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all, you know, good,
nice guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy Francis was probably there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you met Francis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he was there that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I had met Eddie multiple times
before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out at his farm in, in the lake.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had met Eddie that multiple
times before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so he knew me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we had a, we had a talking
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with Jack Herrer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're all hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that year I had re-hooked up with the
guy from Hayes Brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he gave me a, they're still,
he was still messing with, with the purple
[SPEAKER_01]: Hayes at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is he still alive?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a while, that was a long time
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he gave me a derivative, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A phenotype of the purple Hayes,
which wasn't like, it didn't grow like the
[SPEAKER_01]: purple Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had the same flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar color.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just wasn't the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he gave me that, told me here,
you can use this, you can breed with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you're done breeding with it,
kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, all right, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I used it to go across, to go across
the grapefruit Hayes that I had gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: from Turtle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful grapefruit Hayes, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I had gotten from Turtle.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it made a, that's what I made the
purple Hayes out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I brought the, the stuff that I had
grown out, this, you know, derivative
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype of this purple Hayes to this
park.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack walks by and he goes, what the hell
are you smoking?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, bro, this is, you know,
this is a phenotype of the purple Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I knew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that was the purple Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just, that just like got my vibes
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got me, oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when he sits down next to me,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And me and Jack are sitting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets out his, his little Jack pipe,
you know, his proto pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's, he takes a bud of the purple
Hayes and stuffs it in there and he lights
it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's smoking on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he turns to me and he stuffs the pipe
right in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was slobbered on big time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, fuck, I'm French kissing Jack
air right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I take a big hit, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, bro, nice pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he gives me the pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gives me his pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I roll a big fatty joint of the
purple Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we pass it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes around the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of guys around the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inspector was at the table as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: CSI Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we pass it around the table and it
goes around and it's a thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it makes it around easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once first time goes around the second
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this stuff, when you get down about
halfway, bro, it was that, it was that
[SPEAKER_01]: type of weed that, that, that half of the
joint would just turn black.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just that long buster,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just buck you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it comes back around and I tell Jack
the long buster.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take a big hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take a little hit Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause Jack is sick.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he's, he's sick at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he doesn't listen to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He takes a big hit, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he starts coughing and he keeps
coughing and he keeps coughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then his lips turned blue and I'm
like, he's gonna fucking die right here in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had brought this man from Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had some, some cannabis church with
Eddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't know what his name was,
but he was taking care of Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he comes out and we pick Jack up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take him in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sit him in a recliner.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is rubbing Jack's legs, getting Jack to
calm down, gets Jack to stop coughing and
[SPEAKER_01]: then Jack passes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Falls asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, thank God.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I walk outside and I walked to the
table and all these guys are laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, bro, that wasn't fucking funny
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still, I'm still used to like,
bro, you were about to be known as the
[SPEAKER_01]: stoner that killed Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was going to live, be your legacy for
your life, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just not even funny, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Killed him with haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Killed him with the haze, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're sitting around, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're still at the same table and
there's a good story.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, the Mendo perps,
I brought, so what ended up happening was
[SPEAKER_01]: the Mendo perps had gotten stolen from
Jack, from Eddie Leps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually Jason King's string.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Francis gave it to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so it had gotten, it got to Eddie
Leps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eddie Leps was supposed to keep it under
wraps, not let it get out, period,
[SPEAKER_01]: not give it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody that was working with him
stole it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then inspector got it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Several other people got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eddie knew that it got stolen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so inspector gave it to me and I had
grown it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had an ounce in my pocket as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And inspector was like, don't bring that
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be just like, that's going
to be just like the purple haze and
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody's going to smell it and they're
going to know exactly what the hell it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, you know what that smells
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so I was like, bro, I ain't
scared, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ain't scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to break this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to roll a fatty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to smoke it right here,
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I rolled it up, rolled up a fatty,
passed it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody who I'm not going to mention
walks by, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And smells it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And looks over at the table at us like,
you motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then they knew it was me who busted it
out because I already knew that I was a
[SPEAKER_01]: rabble rouser.
Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Eddie Lipp is maybe 40 feet away in the
distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: They walk over to Eddie, start talking to
him about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looks over.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's all mad dogging us at the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walks over.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, who got that out of me?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that it's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's, it's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing you're going to be able to
do about it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, just, you know, release,
release the karma, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Release the karma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's one of those types of dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's karma to Eddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was like, where'd you get it,
man?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, bro, this is no snitch zone,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't review my sources, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, well, well, you know,
you know, that was really messed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's out there already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he stands there and talks to me for a
minute longer, steps away, comes back and
[SPEAKER_01]: says, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I released the bad karma on that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever's got it can do whatever they want
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then at that point, you know,
inspectors looking at me like,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, you're a dick, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a saw and a hot water and blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so then after that, right,
I walk in the house and Eddie's sitting on
[SPEAKER_01]: the couch and he calls me over.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, come on over here, Kendall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I respect you for that, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I respect that you brought that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody else wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were, you know, they were thinking
that, you know, it was just going to cause
[SPEAKER_01]: him problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Hey, I'm ready for it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better to be, you know, out in front
and take the punch than, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just continue to duck and hide,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's like, I respect that, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually feel better about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel better about that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yada, yada.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were talking and he's inviting me
back to the ranch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, his, his farm up there,
30,000 fucking pop plants right in the
[SPEAKER_01]: vision of the highway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nuts, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: He invites me back over there and he's
telling me, yeah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You come up and we're going to do
ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get, we're going to do some
ayahuasca, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to, we're going to have this
just crazy ass mental exercises and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after, after, you know,
the morning, we're going to wake up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: morning and we're going to pee into a
glass, our first pee, and then we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to drink our own pee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, what's up with that,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, your body purifies it,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it even purer and stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next day when you do it,
you just enter the cosmos and just fly
[SPEAKER_01]: through the universe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, just, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Andy, that's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to drink our own pee,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was dead fucking serious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was dead serious, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you drink your pee?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not down for ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did, I did peyote before, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was far enough for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not into it either.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything I have to puke to enjoy,
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people try to get me to do DMT even
this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm like, nah, nah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm nuts enough, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need to, I don't need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll do some mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can handle those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do some shrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even down for acid anymore,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I chewed a lot, I chewed a lot of
jams, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm weak on that shit now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I've been, I've done stuff and
like, I know my brain and it's just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I deal with enough shit in my brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not into that, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, that was a, that was a
good party.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a, that was a very eventful
party, obviously, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a beautiful story too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next year, the next year was,
oh no, so that year as well, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: my wife is there with me, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's chilling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's sitting next to DJ and Jason,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he turns to her and he's got his
blueberry, you know, DJ crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a nice guy, but he's a big head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a, he's a bot star and he turns to
her and he's like, you know, here,
[SPEAKER_01]: here, check this flower out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smell that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that smell like to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife looks at him and my wife is a,
my wife is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, you know what it smells like
to me?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smells like weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just, he, he got sour, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got salty right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody, everybody at the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we're at this, this like 20 foot
long table, you know, and this is what
[SPEAKER_01]: NCGA had the party with the 20 foot long
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you had jars everywhere,
you know, of everybody's weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like at that time, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the guys that were growing
there, they were growing with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, grow more, grow more 2020,
2020, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And dude, I mean, there's no, come on,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're smoking cardboard, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're smoking cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I brought this preservation haze and I
brought the GURPL haze and I had jars of
[SPEAKER_01]: that on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people, you know, you can just go
around, open a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you open my jar and that shit would
just slap you in the face.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, that smells fucking great.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are grabbing buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab another bud, put it aside,
taking that home with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now my jar is empty and people are
like, Hey, your jar is empty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, all right, whoop, take that jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring another jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I brought, you know, I brought a box
of jars of each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put that thing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are getting butt sore, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are getting butt sore.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the same kind of parties now and I
see the same shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when, when certain jars go empty and
the guys think they're the shit,
[SPEAKER_03]: like just why is my jar full?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, the other,
the other thing about these parties too,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is joints are going around the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I look at the joint and I'm
like, dude, that has a, that has a one
[SPEAKER_01]: inch fucking black as fuck ash on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pass it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are looking at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to confront.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to confront me right in
front of the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they know they're going to get the
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to hear, but they'll come
to me later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come to me later and be like, Hey man,
why'd you pass my joint?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, bro, that thing had a rock
hard ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have flicked it, flicked it from
two feet off the table and it would have
[SPEAKER_01]: made a bump on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I'm like, that's what,
what do you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: You use grow more, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I use, you know, I use blue
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, use blue stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you get, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to dis you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you make plenty of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you make plenty of money,
but I'm not, that's not what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how I grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a different methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I apologize if I passed
on your weed, but you know, I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to choke myself out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be like, honestly, you know,
I find that people that will use something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that will use a lot of other things
that I don't find appealing either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got COPD and emphysema already.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't imagine if I would have been
smoking everybody else's weed at those
[SPEAKER_01]: points.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably be dead by now.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, just, you know, looking at some
of this, some of this bud that was going
[SPEAKER_01]: around, dude, it was just, it was fucking
horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And smelling, smelling it was even worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you smelling?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're smelling fucking basement bat,
you know, just smells like Brit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it cracks me up because, you know,
you see this joint going around,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my weed right there that's going
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how do you flush?
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my mind, I'm like, you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're never going to get that shit out of
this plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it really flushing is a
misnomer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't flush a plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You allow a plant to use what's contained
within, you know, within the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's available resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within the root zone, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't flush a plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, listen to these guys talk
about what they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like, so that first to go
back to the first party that I went to,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was me, Elkslayer and Inspector GT.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and Elkslayer actually coaxed,
coaxed Inspector out of hiding because
[SPEAKER_01]: Inspector had never gone to any of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fourth generation guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was real, real under, didn't do any
of that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're at the, we're at the parties and
he was a, he was a lurker on Overgrow and
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis World.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we met, right, he was like,
bro, I fucking love the way you deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have a blast tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can already tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have so much fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Elkslayer was the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Elkslayer just loved that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, God fucking loved it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go to the party.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're having a good time, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm getting people to say the
stupidest shit on the planet, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just painting themselves into a corner
about how they grow, what they do and all
[SPEAKER_01]: this type of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then after the party, we leave kind
of early, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we were just tired of the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We leave kind of early and we had a spot
near their Airbnb with a hot tub.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went, we got some alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sitting in the hot tub, smoking
weed, talking about the party and just
[SPEAKER_01]: laughing our fucking asses off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I bet, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, so did you, did you hear
what this one guy said about how he does
[SPEAKER_01]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: He fucking jumps up, pops on his right leg
twice, hops on his left leg, pirouettes,
[SPEAKER_01]: sprinkles pixie dust over his right
shoulder on his plant and then sings
[SPEAKER_01]: Kumbaya.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just laughing our asses off.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are trying to act like they,
like they reinvent the wheel the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: they grow weed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Always.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are some new methodologies,
obviously, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, with the advent of LED and some of
the different things that we're doing now
[SPEAKER_01]: that people are doing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's new methodologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back then, bro, no, no, no,
no, you're just growing regular style,
[SPEAKER_01]: OG style.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not, it's not happening that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely not happening that way,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it was, it was definitely a trip
being exposed to, you know, personally,
[SPEAKER_01]: to some of these rock stars, the pot
stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like when I met Ed Rosenthal,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I went up to his, went up to his place in
the Oakland Hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big Raider fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would go to the Raider games and
I'd be wearing my, you know, my different
[SPEAKER_01]: pot shirts and shit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I walked by this guy,
you know, over and over again,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he'd be like, nice shirt, nice shirt,
nice shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then he calls me over.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, Hey man, I'm Ed Rosenthal's
personal assistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, yeah, I'm Ed Rosenthal's
personal assistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but he had a personal assistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a personal assistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so he's like, you want to meet Ed?
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, I met Ed before, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, no, this would be personal,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can come up to the house and meet Ed
and, and it'll be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll love it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, all right, fine, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put together a couple ounces of some,
you know, preservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hays and Gurpal Hays, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grew organically, um, took them up
there and, uh, he takes me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ed is sitting around the table with,
uh, Brett from Apothecary.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brett Bogue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know Brett.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew Brett already from before,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up in, uh, up in Mendo and, uh,
this guy, Jim, who puts on, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Seattle Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy has like seven foot dreads,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these guys are all sitting around the
table and they're actually doing a,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, a judging, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They got all these little, little jars of
weed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're judging it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, uh, this guy introduces me
to Ed, introduced me to everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, I sit down and Ed's
like, so I understand you, you brought
[SPEAKER_01]: something really, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: My assistant says, you, you know,
you grow some pretty good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, it's a pretty good weed,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and by this time I had not only
knew how to grow, but I had learned how to
[SPEAKER_01]: consistently and perfectly cure my weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so important, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I learned from the OGs at
Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than anything was how to dry and cure
properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: How to not screw up a good grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was head and shoulders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I mean, literally I went to,
I went to one of the first things that I
[SPEAKER_01]: did with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't when NCA just partied or
anything, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just a little, a little grow
party and, uh, these guys were busting out
[SPEAKER_01]: this weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just fucking incredible,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just fucking incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had weed in my pocket and you know,
the guy was like, well, let me cure your
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, frankly, I'm embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't want to show you what
I've got, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some of the most awesome shit I've
fucking heard in forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, bro, I didn't, what,
what am I going to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to, I don't want to break it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teach me.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people do not have that ability
to self assess their weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then there were, there were a
couple of guys sitting around and these
[SPEAKER_01]: are, you know, OGs, old guys, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, bro, I'll teach you
what's going on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show me your weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I busted it out, you know, and showed
them and they said, oh, it's grown well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grown well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main thing I could say is you probably
didn't dry it properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll teach you how to dry and cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I learned that shit, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: How to dry and cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I bust these ounces out with Ed,
put them on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, before Ed can even reach
them, Brett snatches one of the bags,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Opens it up and he's like, Ooh,
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puts it to the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim grabs a bud and Ed's like,
Hey man, what are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't bring that shit for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: He brought it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I brought it for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's got the other bag in his hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: When it was a preservation ace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told him, you need to be real
careful with that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one is aptly named lobster stocks
because it is so racy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll make you feel like your eyes are out
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you another story in a minute
about the lobster stocks, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so it is like, Oh, I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, you don't need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to grab any buds out of
their edges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give these guys each a bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause whatever's left is yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought this for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's like, all right, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we're conversing and talking,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and Ed starts, you know, tells me
that, uh, you know, when, when I leave,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can have any book in his little,
his little store room of books,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That first, that first Bible you put out
growers Bible killed a bunch of my plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, and then Brett was like,
yeah, mine too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, yeah, I brought up,
you know, a couple of excerpts that fucked
[SPEAKER_01]: me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, get the revised edition assholes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you know, that was a,
that was a good little, good little
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I went in and, you know, I had
respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a bunch of his books, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still up here on my shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't read them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't even cracked them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're sitting there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ed can't teach me nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, a little story about that,
uh, the lobster stocks, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a preservation haze and it's,
um, G 13 hash plant.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the 88, not the 88 G 13 ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the one Indian guy got the one Indian
guy had was, was derived from the original
[SPEAKER_01]: G 13 ash plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this I got from clips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you remember clips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeder clips, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pacific G 13, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pacific is G 13.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that, uh, and cross that with this,
uh, this, um, Reservation haze or what was
[SPEAKER_01]: the haze?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was the same grapefruit days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the grapefruit days as well across
both of the present, the purple,
[SPEAKER_01]: the purple haze with the grapefruit days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the, uh, the, um, G 13 Ash plant
with the, with the, the, uh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With this grapefruit days and,
um, the shit bro, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: was so fucking racy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was absolutely ridiculous, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I grew a plant and it was actually,
it was actually a 13 pounder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was stupid, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and, um, it was so fucking racy
that I didn't even want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was getting rid of it to some people
and one of my buddies in Salinas,
[SPEAKER_01]: he, uh, he bought some pounds of it and,
uh, he had him, he had a nice little shop,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A t-shirt shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, one of his buddies comes in a
Vectorano, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking to OG, OG Mexican dude,
old school, uh, used to be Norteño,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Socks up past his kneecaps, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my kind of person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so he, uh, he rolls up a nice size
joint and they're smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my buddy's like, yeah, I'm only
good for a couple of hits off that shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this Vectorano was like,
what the fuck, eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can smoke anything, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke flats.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke shirms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can smoke anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me that shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna finish this joint, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He smokes the whole joint, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that shit, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me an ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he buys an ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he gets in his car and he drives away.
[SPEAKER_01]: He stops at a stop sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's waiting for that motherfucker to turn
green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop signs don't turn green, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he phases out and then phases back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't know where he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't know where he's going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has no idea about shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: His fucking heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's freaking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a sign right up in front of
him that says hospital this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he drives his veteran ass to the
hospital, says, I don't know what they
[SPEAKER_01]: gave me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they put something in the weed or
smoked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shit is killing me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna die right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave him milk and cookies,
sat him in a bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me left later.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy calls me up a little while later
and tells me, yeah, man, that shit fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: fucked this dude up, sent him to the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hilarious, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to put a warning on that,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one of my buddies took some to a
light show in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another OG, I can't remember what his
online handle was, but you would know him.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would know him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another OG, no good names left,
but took this stuff and whipped it out and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're smoking it in the hotel room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next thing you know, this guy,
and I can't remember his name,
[SPEAKER_01]: is freaking the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody came and knocked on the door
and he tried to climb out of a fourth
[SPEAKER_01]: story window.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to physically restrain him and
hold him down from this weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen some crazy shit, but yeah,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's been times where I felt like
doing that, but I stayed in the little
[SPEAKER_03]: ball that I was in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I didn't like this weed,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to me it was like, it was just
beyond.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally beyond.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: No reason to go to that area because you
already know where it's at.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You already know what's up with that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have thousands of seeds to have
it, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they viable?
[SPEAKER_03]: You think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because after this airs, dude,
people are going to be wanting the most
[SPEAKER_03]: racy weed on earth and hitting you up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have thousands of beings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what I'm going to do, man,
is like I told you, we talked about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start doing some breeding
here soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start doing some breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I probably have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: One and a half million seeds, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much old school stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things, you know, and we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got a I got a pretty good
methodology for popping them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you have a if you have a
good methodology for popping old seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I really want everything to be
hyper sterile, as sterile as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like some people like getting in like
beneficial bacterias and stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: other popping seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want that shit sterile so no bacteria
can ruin that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting back to the overgrow and that
situation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a beautiful place for people to get
together overgrown cannabis world,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on that fateful day in 2006,
when I woke up and clicked on the site and
[SPEAKER_01]: it didn't come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I put out some feelers and people
told me it went down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cried.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a family.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's your place.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't understand who don't have a
tribe, who don't have a fucking tribe and
[SPEAKER_03]: weren't like in those early on days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Online days where where not everyone in
the world was online.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was it was a camaraderie between
people who understood that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: community and tribe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, that's.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's that was a lot for a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just lurking, just beginning to lurk
in 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it took it took it took a couple
of months for even even a small amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: us to find each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like ICMAG was an ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because ICMAG was just starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I think I think Roll It Up kicked
off right when Overgrow went down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they kicked off right then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the first.
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Farmer was already was already
gone, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nobody.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have any.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have a very big member base.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was funny, too, because I started
off at ICMAG.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Gypsy had heard of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I came over there and he told me none
of those shenanigans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you know, we don't play any
of those games.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, let's let's keep it civil
and blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you know, problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I enjoyed ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to roll it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roll It Up was bullshit right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Throw it up, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: The worst of the noobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I went in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told him, yeah, I want you to I want
you to delete my name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to delete me from the website
because you couldn't delete yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, no, we don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to keep you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you know, you either delete my
name or I'm going to go with every single
[SPEAKER_01]: website, every Kendo website, and I'm
going to dog your site like you ain't
[SPEAKER_01]: never seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to you're not going to
have Kendo as a part of your website when
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't when I can't deal with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, you know, I guess they went out
and asked some people, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, you delete his fucking
name, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get his name out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't even don't even don't even play.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be it's going to be you're
going to be fucked because you don't use a
[SPEAKER_01]: pit bull.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they deleted my name.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the farmer, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still like the farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: TC Farmer, you know, capitulator and
Mark's Castle and I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you ain't shit unless you got a bunch of
haters, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It means you haven't pushed enough buttons
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that shit, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's I think that's incredible,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like talking about IC Mag, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nugs and jugs, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went to the Santa Cruz Nugs and Jugs,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of guys there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who tossed it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who threw it?
[SPEAKER_03]: The original Nugs and Jugs in Santa Cruz?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Joe Schmo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Joe Schmo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was her name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Outcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: She just passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe Schmo and Outcast, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss Elaine, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was so sweet and I wanted to do an
interview with her, but she was passing
[SPEAKER_03]: like from cancer over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't want to waste some of the
last time she had with her family on an
[SPEAKER_03]: interview.
[SPEAKER_03]: But goddamn, she's a wonderful woman.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they threw they threw that Nugs and
Jugs up in Santa Cruz, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And bro, it was it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a it was a blind cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a blind cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, you know, there was a lot of
people there, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a who else was there?
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy who who found the white chrome.
Chrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chrome was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hillbilly on PCP.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: His online name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's one of the guys we were talking
about earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a bunch of good breeders there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good, good guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they had a blind a blind cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he just rolled up a bunch of joints and
passed them around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and, you know, I put my Gropel Hayes
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was supposed to be an indoor
contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Gropel was outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it it went around and
everybody was just I could tell I was just
[SPEAKER_01]: being quiet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could tell everybody was like,
wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it ended up winning second place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only got beat by three ninety eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't blame it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just all gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, especially because it's early on
for Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a it's a great cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just all gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was all happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then, you know, Hillbilly on PCP
and my other buddy, the guy, the no name,
[SPEAKER_01]: they knew that it was outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So did Chrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So did Chrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I showed him what I brought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all like, that one,
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put that one in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then he'll be on PCP jumps up and he
goes as outdoor bitches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was mad.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were mad because it was because it
was outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people think outdoor is not as
good as indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow some fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow some fine outdoor weed,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how to make that shit fade like
nobody else, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit turns purple, purple,
yellow, orange, light green, magenta.
[SPEAKER_03]: You and your son have some killer plans,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's you know, it's it has a lot
to do with the with the way that the sun,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean, reduces by two
minutes a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a lot to do with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a lot of my indoor stuff to to
do a fade as well, because I started
[SPEAKER_01]: reducing the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I let it get you like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's six and a half seventh week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I start reducing the time by like five
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, five minutes or just doing it that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the plant, the plant starts to
recognize that it needs to do what it's
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you keep that 12, you keep that 12
going the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant doesn't recognize it's time to
die until it's time to fucking die.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can you can initiate that really
nice trade by reducing your time a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially with sativas that like the
fucking long hours, they like shorter
[SPEAKER_03]: light hours at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the things that I do with my
sativas, too, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: To keep them from herming or acting real
stupid is you take and instead of slapping
[SPEAKER_01]: them into 1212, you reduce the you reduce
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, over a couple of week period.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just keep reducing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then give it to that 1212 period.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, most sativas, even if you get it
down to a 14 and then stick it down an
[SPEAKER_01]: hour after that, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: An hour, one week and an hour the next
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it's going to increase your 12 to
14 week flower time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, if you're going if you're
growing a true tie, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you better have a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot in how is that one?
[SPEAKER_03]: How is that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, man, it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tails.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I did was I started it in a nice
big fucking pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm letting it grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that shit is just going nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking going nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I flower it and it goes even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's stretching even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stretching even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put it up against the wall and I put
this this, you know, four by four cattle
[SPEAKER_01]: fencing across this entire wall and then
just we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking cattle fencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let it go and let it go and let it go.
[SPEAKER_01]: 16 fucking weeks later, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a million little little buds,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fire little buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot for people who don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I remember correctly, and this is the
story passed down late years on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was grown by a family in Vietnam for a
period of time and bred and then made its
[SPEAKER_03]: way here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Dewey Dewey Delat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dewey Delat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dewey Delat.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was an OG in Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Vietnam.
Dewey.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wild, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does any of that stuff exist still,
do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Delat stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to find the original
Delat.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's too bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember the smells or any of that
from the Delat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was real.
It was real.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't piney.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of kind of sweet, a little
bit, a little bit sweet, but it was more
[SPEAKER_01]: along the lines of like a what terpene
would I call that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it wasn't like piney.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't terpene?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of hard to describe,
to be honest, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I've heard it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little sweet to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little savory.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like not like meat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had plenty of strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like meaty, but it wasn't like
meat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a combination.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember later on, people said Delat was
like dead meat.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the one description.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, it didn't make sense for a
Thai to be dead meat.
[SPEAKER_03]: The savory I could get.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like savory, sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an interesting combination therein,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting back to that Nugs and Jugs,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did the contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came in second.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, they're my strippers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the strippers are doing their
thing, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dancing, taking shit off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was great, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, the owner of the
property was like an Airbnb before Airbnb.
[SPEAKER_01]: The owner of the property comes busting
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, I do not approve of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's having a fit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the strippers don't even care.
[SPEAKER_01]: They start dancing right in front of him,
doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're all high as fuck, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just giggling and laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all just high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was smoking everybody's weed at
that party.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no grow more at that party,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all good weed, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just high as fuck, laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's yelling and screaming,
I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys all get out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I'm calling the police.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just laughing until he finally
got on the phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got on the phone and was calling the
police.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at that point, everybody was
like, we all took off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Killed the nugs and jugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had about an hour of stripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a blast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you made it through the fucking
judging?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Made it through the judging.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was first.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was first, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good party, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that got me in an icy mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I wasn't that proletarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't that prolific in icy mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the Cabana had gotten created.
[SPEAKER_01]: By D-Man?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was he the one who created it originally?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was D-Man and Skitty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skitty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: D-Man and Skitty, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Skitty's cherry slider.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I remember Skitty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Skitty's cherry slider.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Choco-D.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, Choco-D.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the Cabana started, everybody was
like, we're going to start a site.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get this going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Skitty approached me, because he
was super impressed with the moderator,
[SPEAKER_01]: moderation, and the moderated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I had laid out, not only did I
point out each aspect of the moderation
[SPEAKER_01]: situation, but I also laid out a scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I laid out a means by which I thought that
a site would be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Without all the bullshit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it entailed anonymous moderators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're anonymous, now you're
not going to get a big head.
[SPEAKER_01]: People aren't going to try to kiss your
ass and treat you a certain way.
Smart, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't ban people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You simply limit their views.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you limit their visibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You limit their scope of what they can
actually do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And several other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he asked me to help put the site
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I helped him put the site together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a good site for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good site for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the moderators just started
acting stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it goes, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: The moderators started acting stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they weren't happy because they
weren't getting the recognition that they
[SPEAKER_01]: felt they deserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't happy because they weren't
getting anything for the moderating they
[SPEAKER_01]: were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they allowed them to become part owners
and remove their anonymity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as they removed their
anonymity, bro, it just started going
[SPEAKER_01]: downhill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the OGs just started leaving
because they were getting a bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't say anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started becoming like the world we live
in now.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people that were a part of
different social dynamics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started really pushing their agenda
on the site.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pushing people into corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of people started leaving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I started going back to being
Kendo and started calling them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Started talking hella smack, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I got my first band.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was just a short band.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: They even removed the whole limiting your
visibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Started banning people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a lot of stuff that goes
on behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of backdoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
Always.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what we're talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: The black market scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff going on there
through personal private messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody was doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some people that were way more
successful than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were doing really, really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, certain people who were of higher
renown got butsler because those certain
[SPEAKER_01]: people were doing really, really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing better than them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cutting into their sails as they saw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they called them out, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In open forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: In open forum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which to me is kind of snitchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not kind of, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not kind of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's snitching.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're dry snitching somebody,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It is dry snitching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you know me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came right out and I was like,
no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not right, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you guys are doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're trying to call this person out
saying that they're, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not right for doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're putting everybody at risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't even try it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I got a six month band.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bang.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big fat band, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So then at that point, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of people left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of people left at that point,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time I got back six months later,
because I didn't even post.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just went in looking at private
messages.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time I got back, it was already
starting to turn into a ghost town.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then, you know, and I'll just be
honest, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go back every once in a while,
just read private messages, do my thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then recently, I got into a little
scuffle with one of the original people
[SPEAKER_01]: that created the site.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like to talk shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have certain ideals and ways that
they think about stuff that I don't agree
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we talked a bunch of shit
to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next thing you know, they put out
a post on the Cabana saying that I got
[SPEAKER_01]: arrested by the FBI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then they said, for security concerns,
we're going to delete Kendo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they deleted me from the site,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I would tell people at
this point, you know, if you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be on the Cabana, be real careful,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do that type of shit to me, or do that
shit to other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, they, you know, they also,
they know that someone was doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but they know what people are doing
to DMs unless they're reading them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that was so silly that they came
out and said that, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're doing this in private messages
because that was one of the points that I
[SPEAKER_01]: brought up was, how would you know unless
you're reading people's private messages?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they painted themselves into a
corner, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, how are you going to
get out of that corner?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they tried to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So-and-so said that they're doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've experienced a lot of what I
experienced on forums, which is don't be,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they don't like the dude who
pushes back and calls stuff back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of people don't want to be
burned, but every single forum nowadays
[SPEAKER_03]: has a seed bank attached to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that comes with the gender.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I mean, I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back in the day, right, I wasn't into
buying seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, honestly, I've never bought a
seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems goofy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like from your point of view, if you're
making seeds, you know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had access to the Cult of Argyros.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want, what the fuck's the point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then, I mean, in the way that we
did things in the past, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started a campaign called the Great
Bean Giveaway, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And literally, bro, I gave away 150,000
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just gave away, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did it anonymously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knew it was me, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Johnny Gonja seed was my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would put up a post and say,
this is my garden, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would just put up a bunch of
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: No pictures, just strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people would come in and be like,
oh, bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have that many strains going,
yada, yada, yada.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other people would be like,
wow, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that one and that one and that
one, this sounds really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those sound like some really good strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was all stuff that was being
donated from all the breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: All kinds of different stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when people would say that,
I'd send them a private message and be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, hey, bro, check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a, you know, this is a ruse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a post so that, you know,
people can come and ask me for these
[SPEAKER_01]: beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want them, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me an addy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you want to, if you want to
donate $5, that'd be great because that'll
[SPEAKER_01]: cover, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll cover your cost of me shipping you
seeds as well as somebody else's costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not only paying for yours,
but you're paying it forward as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would send out those little,
you know, like the three by five envelopes
[SPEAKER_01]: with the bubble wrap in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like a dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then, you know, they might ask for
three, three strains and I would send them
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred beans or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the thing, you know,
that or note that I typed up and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, give, give a friend a bean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So please pass some of these beans forward
onto someone that you know that's
[SPEAKER_01]: grilling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we literally gave away 150,000 seeds,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just gave them all away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I didn't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody really knew until my buddy,
No Good Names Left figured it out that it
[SPEAKER_01]: was me, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He was one of the first people that I gave
beans to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, he came out and ratted me
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I didn't want, I didn't want anybody
to know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't do things like that so people
can blow up your ego.
[SPEAKER_01]: It bothers me when I see people who go out
and what do they call that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Virtue signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I gave a bum $5 today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the video of me doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a video of me doing it,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Virtue signaling to me is bullshit,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna hate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I was raised, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: By my, you know, I wasn't raised by my
grandma, but my grandma would tell me
[SPEAKER_01]: about how when the Great Depression was
around and there were all the bums,
[SPEAKER_01]: they lived near the railroad tracks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the bums would be on the trains and
they would, you know, get off the train
[SPEAKER_01]: and they would just make a big huge pot of
beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: My grandma's family would make a huge,
we're talking a huge pot of beans and just
[SPEAKER_01]: give it out to the bums until it was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And feed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, that's what you're supposed
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, you know, that just,
you know, giving out those seeds is just
[SPEAKER_01]: an example of how we used to do it,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the same thing, you know,
I was a whore, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would get strains, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would give them to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, the cheese pissed people
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one that pissed people off that I
whored out was the Albert Walker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that pissed people off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I bet it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it goes back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Doc's.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it was, you know,
I apologize to them big time, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I'm so sorry I did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no right to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was a different guy back then,
but you know, they were, they had the
[SPEAKER_01]: Albert Walker and him and a couple of guys
that he had given it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about it on the forum,
out and open forum, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started a thread about, you know,
eating your ice cream in the sandbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you give your buddy a lick,
you give your other buddy a lick and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you show the ice cream to everybody else
and tell them you can't have none.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the Eddie Murphy skit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where, that's what brought it
to my mind, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, you know, I was like,
that's bullshit, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just straight bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I got the Albert Walker and I
whored it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, me and Doc, we didn't get
along for a while, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw each other at the Emerald Cup
and we saw each other at the Emerald Cup
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, made up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize big time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I'm sorry, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I can make it up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, you know, this long time
ago, man, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, you know, we're, you know,
we're over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say we're
friends, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we don't call each other on the
phone all the time, but I got his number.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could call him anytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it, you know, I,
I, I enjoy that because there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people that I've, I've, I've apologized to
for calling them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But even then, a lot of people are like,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I deserved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I deserved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, you know what though?
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't, I shouldn't have done it,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just an asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I'm not such an asshole
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for me, I get, I get way more
satisfaction out of the minds that I can,
[SPEAKER_01]: can alter or get into the, into the line
of how to think as opposed to what to
[SPEAKER_01]: think.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's more important than anything,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: How to think, teaching people how to
analyze, how to use their, their critical
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking skills.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how many people do that nowadays,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to lie to you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you asked me questions here,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, someone could give me a
little blowback.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, these are, these are things
that, you know, other people probably
[SPEAKER_01]: could get some good, some good knowledge
from.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the whole reason we started this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, we get bloated.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that, that my co-partner didn't
realize was that by digging into cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: history, just the genetic side,
just looking at the genetic side and
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to start putting some of these
pieces together, he didn't realize how
[SPEAKER_03]: much blowback he was going to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because from his aspect, he's just a
historian, you know, but you're cutting
[SPEAKER_03]: into agendas and money streams,
things that people have attached deeply to
[SPEAKER_03]: their, their lives and character that
aren't true.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all coming out in the wash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it upsets people.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite old sayings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a seedy business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the Oregon market has been
pretty tough, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had four farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already liquidated one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got two on hold right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a fourth one that I'm doing some
things with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the Devil's lettuce cannabis
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be doing, I'll be doing that out
here in the Oregon market as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be doing some seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm looking to,
I'm looking to expand my, my consulting
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big time, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a, I'm doing a lot of consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in Puerto Rico, Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done a lot of other stuff here
locally and I'm getting ready to blow up
[SPEAKER_01]: my LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be Kendo, Kendo the
green wizard, KTGW consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to blow that up now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are looking and people are
looking for a, you know, a, a,
[SPEAKER_01]: a very good consultant, someone who can
bring in the right help, bring in the
[SPEAKER_01]: right experts for your environmental,
for your, you know, for your lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know all the people for your procurement
of equipment, help you to hire the right
[SPEAKER_01]: people to man your grow, to be lead
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been very, very successful taking
failing large enterprises, large
[SPEAKER_01]: enterprises.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 400 lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: From, from failing to making millions a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So absolutely brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate your show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to come back on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll, you know, I'll write up some stuff,
