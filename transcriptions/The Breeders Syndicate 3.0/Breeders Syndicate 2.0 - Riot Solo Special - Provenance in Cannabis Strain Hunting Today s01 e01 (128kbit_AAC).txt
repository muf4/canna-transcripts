[SPEAKER_01]: What up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: How y'all doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, this shit's set, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna start a little early just to
see if we can get everybody joined in by
[SPEAKER_01]: actual 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, this is just so fucking scary and
ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I look at it, I think of it
like a Michael Myers head, but I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: sure it's a Trump head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Speakeasy, can you do me a favor and,
via Patreon, let everybody know that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: about to start on IG?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot to do that first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just sit here like this until it's
time to rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get my hair combed right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's looking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn, that's hard to get off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That big fucking head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like Ric Flair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo!
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully more people show up so we can
actually give a nice treatise on the past,
[SPEAKER_01]: present,
[SPEAKER_01]: future, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if we can talk about the
future of clone trading, clone collecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about it a little bit
recently, about a little bit of where
[SPEAKER_01]: people are that have a lot of these
strains archived that are rare and old and
[SPEAKER_01]: special.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think I've really given a
full, long tale of kind of how it
[SPEAKER_01]: developed over time, how it was when we
were breaking into the scene, like how one
[SPEAKER_01]: would even go about collecting clones in
the first place, because obviously,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a lot of it's trading,
and not everybody has something to trade
[SPEAKER_01]: at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about clone circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got to give myself the own crouch
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But until we start that, anybody have any
questions yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything you want me to touch on so I
don't forget?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Clown hoarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can talk about clown hoarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty of clowns hoarding in the
seed industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, there it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, clown hoarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clown hoarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those bastards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clowns are always hoarding around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clone people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is about clone people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: But going to the theory of it should...
I'm a Ben Sherman fool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how I roll clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it's all the same theory,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can take a theory and apply it to
fools.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully, you guys can use some
critical thinking and apply it,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I don't have to go and go and go over
every single dipshit that's pretending to
[SPEAKER_01]: be in circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a lot easier just to
explain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you know what it is or on a
revedge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm not doing cloning tips and tricks,
but I mean, just for that quick one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's better to take it on a
revedge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's better to take it
beforehand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes things root easier after a
revedge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is George.
[SPEAKER_01]: George from Walmart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think at 80, we can be close enough to
start this bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back in the day, clones weren't really
a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people were using seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say back in the day, I'm talking,
you know, 70s, 60s on through the 80s up
[SPEAKER_01]: until the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clones weren't the primary source for
people to be passing genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of it was done in seed form.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how a lot of this started.
[SPEAKER_01]: On in through when you get up into maybe
like the Northern Lights era would be a
[SPEAKER_01]: good example of how people started getting
in these circles that had certain genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: and were keeping them very tight and only
passing it to people in their circles and
[SPEAKER_01]: trusted people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that all kind of started because,
you know, there were different people in
[SPEAKER_01]: each market and giving someone a special
clone that was considered elite at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the definition of elite back then is a
lot different than now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is definitely morphed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you didn't want to give someone in the
same area as you, the same exact clone,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it was super special, because they'd be
knocking into your market and you guys had
[SPEAKER_01]: ended up competing with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you basically set yourself up to be
competed against.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times when clones were shared,
they were shared in different markets,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there were also clone crews that were
pushing out tons of weight and all pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: each other to brand a particular line,
kind of like the Northern Lights stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you got into online, when Overgrow was
popping up and all that, you had a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people that had amassed these small little
collections of clones during that time,
[SPEAKER_01]: some bigger than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of them would amass these small
clone collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And provenance wasn't as much as a serious
thing back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see you saying clone hoarding over and
over, but I'll get to it, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get to it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you see these people amassed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see small collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as they would speak, they would learn
to trust who was going to keep their word
[SPEAKER_01]: on not passing said clones and making it
back into their market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people would just take the clones
and run and do their own thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: rename it, pretend like it's a new thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how we get to today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I entered, I didn't have special
stuff, but I was in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fortunately, there were a few places.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best one I found was PNC, it was a
dude named Ape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say at least 80% plus of his
things were legit sourced.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a strain nerd, like a lot of us are
still today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did some pretty good sourcing of a
lot of OG cuts, pure cushions,
[SPEAKER_01]: purples back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a really good job sourcing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just fortunate to be in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also had a clone crew that we were a
part of with the Hog's Breath crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that circle, people were allowed to
have the cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't allowed to compete.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't allowed to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't allowed to share it with people
outside the group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how you ended up with people
like the P91 crew, the Hog's Breath crew,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Bull Rider crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ended up with all these different
crews with their one specific cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is kind of before the OG Kush
craze when all that was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once OG Kush hit, it was a lot of
fronting, a lot of pretending.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of fake sourcing and it got really
bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the online market, the online
forums kind of blew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started to get more and more permeated
and a lot harder to verify sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, most of the people that take this
seriously, take provenance seriously in
[SPEAKER_01]: the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say provenance, I don't mean
anything more than like the term applies
[SPEAKER_01]: to art.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a painting that you have and
it's signed by someone, if you can't prove
[SPEAKER_01]: where you got it from back to the artist,
you've lost the provenance and therefore
[SPEAKER_01]: it loses value.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with clones, it's very much the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could say, I got this clone from XYZ,
but nobody knows how XYZ got that clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, it's broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people who are super serious about it
don't really wanna trade with you and they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't wanna get in on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we go to today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trust in the market is all but gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: People today tend to have popped up in the
last few years that are big in the clones
[SPEAKER_01]: trading scene that I'm noticing that keep
having the same mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because they're trading with
people that are new to the scene too,
[SPEAKER_01]: but have them convinced that they are
legit and connected to this guy or this
[SPEAKER_01]: guy or this guy or this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to me and my friends,
we all know who we've given clones to and
[SPEAKER_01]: who those people have given clones to.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part, there's always gonna be
exceptions to the rule, but for the most
[SPEAKER_01]: part, we know who has what clone of old
shit, who has given it, who had permission
[SPEAKER_01]: to get it, who didn't, all of the above.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this still exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is still a fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people around selling clones online
aren't a part of those circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never were any of those people
selling clones online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that with their big ass list,
like, hey, I got all these fucking clones,
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking source from the breeder cut,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are not people that would ever
be trusted with clones in the first place
[SPEAKER_01]: from any of our circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not my circle, not the other circles that
are old that I'm not even a part of.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's gonna trust these dudes with
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I'm seeing a lot of the
problems arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out your OnlyFans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Radio Ridge does have a great OnlyFans.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got this great picture of his
testicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know any verified cuts that look
distinctly different than in his picture?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get to the next topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Verifying cuts through pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a million reasons why this can't
and shouldn't be done and why you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: see guys like me and Inspekta and everyone
trying to verify clones through pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Expressions and micro, like in micro
climates and expressions, things can look
[SPEAKER_01]: totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally fucking different.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there are a few cuts that have
certain traits that we know always occur,
[SPEAKER_01]: no matter what the what the expression is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certain traits that always pop
out of certain clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point being, you guys, the best advice
I could ever give anyone is if you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy spend money on a clone from someone,
chase that shit all the way back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they can't do that, then there's an
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just take their word for it because
I've seen people saying some wild fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: shit that they're getting past Chem 91
directly from a certain source that didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: happen, couldn't happen, and doesn't
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's hard to get those answers,
but if you can't get the answer,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it's not worth getting because every
time I'm seeing people get screwed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time they go buy clones from these
doofuses, they get screwed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they cannot trace the provenance
back to the original breeder, there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can always take the risk and try,
but here's the thing, if you're taking a
[SPEAKER_01]: risk and trying, but you've never had the
original clone, how are you ever going to
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking verify it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And people with the Chem 91 cut wouldn't
be selling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not how that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, Archive Portland is a great place
to get clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Archive is as big a nerd as anyone when it
comes to provenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're getting stuff from Archive
Portland, that's a great source.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, most of these kids are
just trading clones, just trading with
[SPEAKER_01]: people who have no access to anything and
shouldn't have access to anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some of these dudes are cool,
and they don't understand this is going
[SPEAKER_01]: on, and they repeat it, and they repeat
the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now someone else has that story,
and they say, but this guy's trustworthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, who was the guy that you got it
from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that dude trustworthy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the best advice I could ever give
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chase that shit up the chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, places like Harborside, they have
people that they randomly get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back in the day, at least, I don't want
to speak to now, but back in the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would have random people bring in
trays of clones, or they'd have their
[SPEAKER_01]: in-house cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: But often they'd have people bring in
trays of clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're trusting some random ass that a
budtender trusted to bring in clones and
[SPEAKER_01]: vet them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you guys ever talked to budtenders?
[SPEAKER_01]: They know less than probably you do,
even if you're a new person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Budtenders don't get into provenance
sourcing, any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to source something,
do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take the time, meet people, be friendly,
be trustworthy, don't be a snake,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you'd be surprised how quickly things
open up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've told that to people from day one,
and everybody wants to work it around the
[SPEAKER_01]: back end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't comment on finest, because I don't
know who they source stuff from,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, but they've been very nice,
and they've done great tissue culture
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as like, yeah, I know,
let's see, pre-79, $500 a pop,
[SPEAKER_01]: that bubba, that pre-79 bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, if you don't care,
then you're adding to the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, that's really what it comes down
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't care, and you're passing
these stories on without doing the work,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you're adding to the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I have a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you see all this confusion
in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: People throwing up pictures of Chem 91
that don't look like Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's just a really weird grow,
maybe they over blew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I see people commenting in these
fucking threads.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, let me see if I can find it
real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good example of someone, oh,
you can't really see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commenting in a thread that has no fucking
clue what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: This two currents guy, he's new.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's probably newer than most of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's telling, acting like he has a way
that he can, oh, that might be a fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: My motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did you source your Chem 91 to be
making these judgments and claims?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, did you say you sourced it from one of
my best friends?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're lying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's how it goes, how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then other people don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They see this dude speaking in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know that he's a noob.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know any of that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, oh, well, if he says it
might be real, then it might.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how the shit just spins on and on
and on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: How people set themselves up to be a
verifier of cuts when they have no place
[SPEAKER_01]: verifying anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, you'll be hard pressed to
find someone that will verify or shoot
[SPEAKER_01]: something down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, with Chem 91, I could give you a
few pointers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know I've mentioned a few before.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a few pointers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leaf cannibalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nutrient burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the leaves cannibalizing
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one trait it does seem to have is the
never-ending white pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it looks like someone just burned the
shit out of a S1 or hybrid of Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in certain microclimates, maybe,
maybe it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would feel much more confident not
even commenting on this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way to know for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless it's got a lot of the traits and
it's missing one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, yeah, I just wanted to give a
quick example.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, someone was claiming to have a
cut of Archive's moon bow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cancel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone was claiming to have a cut of
Archive's moon bow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Archive called them out on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the guy's like, oh, no,
no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I had the breeder cut of something
else, rainbow belts or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another one that Archive's not going to
pass cuts out, his breeder cuts out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful who you trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Run these fucks down.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what they know about, about sourcing
cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: See who they're dialed into circle-wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then go ask some dudes in the circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likely people will be honest with you and
tell you if they're in their circle or
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very fucking easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about what I wanted to run down on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it used to be more common
knowledge how you did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get into circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get shit immediately because
everybody's been ripped off to shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some people get mad that they
can't just get that clone immediately
[SPEAKER_01]: because clone hoarders, it's not fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know why it's not fair?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because fucking scammers rip everyone
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been that way since day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been that way since day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people that do have cuts are not like
super open to just some random new guy who
[SPEAKER_01]: says, hey, I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's been done for years and years
and years and years and been heard for
[SPEAKER_01]: years and years and years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a major trigger for a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: People in these circles love to share
their clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I look way more serious?
[SPEAKER_01]: People in those circles love to share
their clones because they love sharing
[SPEAKER_01]: dank with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't necessarily like to openly
share clones with random people to
[SPEAKER_01]: bastardize the clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another good example of this would have
been when everyone was trying to chase
[SPEAKER_01]: joint breath for chems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I could go way further into
that, but I'm not going to for the sake of
[SPEAKER_01]: my buddy, Matt Elite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to talk about old pee blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: But needless to say, blind leading the
blind in that situation and people were
[SPEAKER_01]: still paying joint breath for clones
because they've really had that hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that fear of missing out,
logical fallacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also the appeal to authority,
logical fallacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The authority being, oh, well,
this guy's a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says he's a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and pee buds says he's legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that must mean these are legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how much do you know about how much
experience pee buds had with the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever heard the story about him
bringing chem four as Chem D?
[SPEAKER_01]: To a cup and entering it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I shouldn't have probably gotten
that far in, but there's a point to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just trust everyone just because
someone's name is even linked with the
[SPEAKER_01]: clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily a good reason to
necessarily take their word on on clone
[SPEAKER_01]: provenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody got any questions about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: The dog bud male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pee bud put his name behind a dog bud
male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make any sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody else around him was telling,
don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dude's a liar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be a problem and come back
to haunt you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes money is just too much of a
yank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I really, really liked pee bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, you know, he was backing
someone who said they were going to murder
[SPEAKER_01]: me and someone who would say the N word
over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can't deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't handle that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully he's figured life out a little
better and who to run with and who not to
[SPEAKER_01]: run with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I got to go be going to church just
because I'm wearing a long sleeve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked G said he got a mail and he's also
said he didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that comes back to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is the start of the line to get my
money back?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the problem is many don't care
about history or the provenance that make
[SPEAKER_01]: loot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people in here are in here
because they do care about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to get everybody educated on the
same page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, this is a key lime La Croix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, these are the bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much what I always drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't tried a fire sample of apple
fritter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not an apple fritter guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never really run that stuff,
so I can't comment on apple fritter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lumpy's given me some good cuts so before
and they were legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lumpy was a good source for the cookies
and cherry pie early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought as usual, I brought out another
guitar, by the way, to show you guys just
[SPEAKER_01]: because I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought out the black beauty today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is just an epiphone black
beauty, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's still very beautiful,
all gold hardware.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually going to change out these
these pickups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some toaster hand wound pickups
that are going in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look a little more Gretchi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sound a little more Gretchi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is one of the babies,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: All bound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the old epiphone headstock,
which I wish it would have been one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: new ones that look more Gibson,
but it is so pretty, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember why I got it if I was
thinking I was going to play some Mike
[SPEAKER_01]: Ness style stuff or what, but yeah,
I'm not usually I'm the less pickups are
[SPEAKER_01]: better, but this case I went for all
three.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave it up if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be posted on Patreon
after this, so if you guys want to
[SPEAKER_01]: rewatch, run it through the Patreon stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is in a Gibson case,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember where I got the case at
for that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you a neck or bridge pick up kind of
guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: A neck mostly neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the neck sounds for punk rock and
garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you're glad the headstock is OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, probably, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it's so much prettier.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other headstocks are so much prettier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, I wanted a Gibson one,
but in the end, after owning a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: Gibsons and a bunch of Epiphone's,
I've determined I like the necks better on
[SPEAKER_01]: on Epiphone Les Paul's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they have something closer to a
Gibson SG type neck from my experience and
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that nice thin neck because I've
got little lady hands, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The the.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not familiar with the the.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the story around the two?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's way more, way more, way more cuts
of Chem D than just two going around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's way more.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the sham D, the Chem D,
the dirty D, the dead ringer, the
[SPEAKER_01]: Bundysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these are the same cuts just
renamed 100 times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I mean, there's tons,
tons, tons, tons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even Bodhi said his Chem 3 wasn't real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that Chem 3 came from a person that
we know past fake cuts, the incognito
[SPEAKER_01]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I really tried with incognito.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has an amazing seed collection,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's not just shitting on the dude,
but he did interject a lot of bad cuts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just grabbed some super Chem D from Fucker
Joe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got screwed, Black Metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of the reasons we had this little
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to hear that, but you know,
it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: One strain you recommend from some
recommend from you, someone that's never
[SPEAKER_01]: got your gear before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think about Riot Berry V3.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like with what's available, I'd say like
Bubble Berry, Cherry Berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of those just because they're so easy
to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Black Metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we talked about this a thousand
times on this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the people new to it, Tent Flow
actually has screenshots if you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that dude is not cool at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's also he doxed me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, he's just dry snitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why anybody's fucking with
that dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made it real clear, real fucking clear
about old Fucker Joe.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: An SD cat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a surprise to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never heard of the dude when I was down
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the J crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck a Ben Sherman, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, Bodhi is one of the
archivists that I take very seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Radio Ridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has been doing an amazing job of sourcing
legit genetics for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even before they even talk about him,
they run him through a lot of people to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that they have a legit cut
before they declare having any kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, yeah, no, it's the same guy,
Black Metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're definitely talking about the same
idiot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me give you another example today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one that I probably should
have fucking slapped down much harder
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the fake bull rider?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe I don't have a picture of it
ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one dude was showing fake pictures
of bull rider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That?
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude, nobody, no San Diego old
schoolers respect this dude, have ever
[SPEAKER_01]: heard of this dude before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a complete shithead.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had made claims that he and his partner
made Afghani bull rider, and he didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know that there was a difference between
Afghani bull rider and original bull
[SPEAKER_01]: rider.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, since he's been made aware of
that, he's now claiming he has original
[SPEAKER_01]: bull rider, which is dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is that little situation that is not
alive anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never mind that, though, that just
details, details, details.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if anybody wants a real bull rider
cut, the closest you're going to get is
[SPEAKER_01]: old Betsy and old Betsy hybrids right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's plenty of those available,
so there's no reason to even even fuck
[SPEAKER_01]: with someone that stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heard of PNW Strain Hunter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did Skunk 1 originate from?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the most known story in
the history of cannabis and most
[SPEAKER_01]: documented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam the Skunk Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is a true DJ, two blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: People say DJ shorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went through 23 blueberry cuts to find
the one that smells like sour milk and
[SPEAKER_01]: muffins.
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ was the one who popularized the line
called Blueberry, but there have been
[SPEAKER_01]: other cuts called Blueberry that didn't
come from his stuff from around the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully that helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else we got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bullshit writer is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, our ex-farmer, that was the Afghani
bull rider I was referring to,
[SPEAKER_01]: not the old bull rider that I had in my
backpack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then, it was called Bulgani.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee it's the same dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same dude we've all been talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people in here who've been ripped
off by that dude that can tell you just as
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not on my word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, what are some old clones that are
still around that you would like to get
[SPEAKER_01]: your hands on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Old clones that are still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to get my hands on Purple Indica,
but it's not even, you know what,
[SPEAKER_01]: like even stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Via archive to CSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: CSI is super honest with clones and
sharing and it was asked not to share,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I've still never grown Purple Indica
pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like a clone like that I'd be very
interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to think of some other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: The corn's another one I'd be really
interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the relation of old Betsy and bull
rider?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sister stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cuts came from the same person,
so yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guys like Brandon Rust wouldn't know
that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I bet after this he'll be repeating it
like it's fucking some shit he always
[SPEAKER_01]: knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are double edged swords to putting
info out there like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I ran some metal haze back in the
day from Dutch Flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did some metal haze crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very interesting line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty sure it's Positronix haze 19
crossed a skunk one that Positronix sold
[SPEAKER_01]: for a long time and it was renamed Baby
Yoda.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never even heard of Baby Yoda to be
selling it for a thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, again, it's possible to
buy clones that are legit, but know your
[SPEAKER_01]: sourcing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always ask questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just assume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and I get it's very like you want to
be that one dude who can source something
[SPEAKER_01]: and be like, oh, I'm the be like,
I'm the one who got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm one of the very few rare people
to have this rare cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nine times out of 10, that's not going
to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Tom Hill haze skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Tom Hill's haze was a selection from
Positronix haze 19, but it probably was
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing like the same phenom because there
were so many different phenoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you run much of the legends?
[SPEAKER_01]: Chimera stuff firstly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was some of my favorite stuff
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran from Chimera, Sassy Frass,
Mental Floss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mental Floss was my favorite out of the
Chimera stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what else from Legends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny Blaze, Legends Ultimate Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those are the top ones from both of
them that I really, really dug.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that archive post dude selling
one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we talked about that a little bit
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what kind of is helping foster
these situations is people like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But did El Jefe verified cuts of his
elites?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what Hefe did was he made it into our
circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you remember I was talking about
people that get into circles and rip
[SPEAKER_01]: people off and get booted out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody in the circle was very open with
each other and with clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Hefe got a lot of clones from everyone
in the group and ripped everyone off and
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately started selling them against
everybody's wishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of the reasons, a perfect example
of someone who's a fucking piece of shit
[SPEAKER_01]: that does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily he lost most of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them he was handed were fake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can be thankful for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's a shame.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a shame.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the one cut that you haven't worked
with that you would grab if you could?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go with Korn on that one just cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Hefe was hilarious until he wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: He damaged and burned every bridge he
possibly could have fucking had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which made a lot of sense because when he
came to our crew he didn't really have any
[SPEAKER_01]: friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Korn is an old cut that archive had.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd have to ask him what it actually is
and the story behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was purple pain?
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a few different purple pains,
but purple champagne was supposed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the F1 derb.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been called a thousand different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay trippy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is he with the fake Death Star?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: How big a phenovariation would you see in
Chem 91 S1s?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't run them, but just from
observing people pop them online.
[SPEAKER_01]: In talking to CSI, it sounds like it has a
fairly good amount of variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff that looks like sour all the way to
stuff that looks like pure Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what copy genetics is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Double purple Doja.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always been pretty rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if people pop up at the day,
I'm always skeptical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fairfax election according to the ICMAG
forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's more than one Korn on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fairfax election.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four-way selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could Jeff make Afghani bull rider?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I smoked it, sold it Afghani bull
rider bud, but I never really cared
[SPEAKER_01]: because like who did what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it wasn't bull rider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't have anything to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's the NL preservation project going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Death Star.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know El Jefe used a Death Star,
so I wouldn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit from Woodshed was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: He brought that to a party.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the first can of Luminati party and
he was just invited in to come to the
[SPEAKER_01]: party and he showed up with his Death
Star.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd been fucking banging on about how
dank it was and I took one look and one
[SPEAKER_01]: smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, well fuck you got skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got skunk one, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can't tell that, you shouldn't
be trading cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that shit was garbed though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was okay for skunk one,
but you know, it wasn't Death Star.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for damn sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna sit here talking about some
fucking nobody the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to that project too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cross the NL5 to one of those P91S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that could be very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a older Afghani base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that'd be really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already talked about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I'm not gonna keep bringing
up or spending time on a fucking nobody,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Death Star OG is great too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure which one you're referring to
or what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that's a rough treatise on how
you should verify cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you go get these cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's really, there's not a great
shortcut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a great shortcut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it takes years to get a cut and
sometimes you'll never get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just as what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: People calling things elites has caused a
lot of different ideas about what these
[SPEAKER_01]: cuts are and how good they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I consider elite may not be what
you consider elite, but back in the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was a consensus value given to stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If something kept getting passed,
because there wasn't the online hype
[SPEAKER_01]: system and Instagram for pictures and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If things kept getting passed,
it was because they were naturally hyping
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves because they were dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after a certain point, enough people
agreed that this clone is dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you got an elite cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, it's anything that gets thrown
on Instagram that some hype schmuck wants
[SPEAKER_01]: you to think.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it is legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, what do you think the relationship
between Super Skunk and Chem is?
[SPEAKER_01]: If any, I think Chem 91 is a pure Super
Skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just my best guess, but pretty,
pretty sure on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: First class genetics is the number one in
legit cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you know that, because I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure the guy's nice, but I just he's
not in our circle, so I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: anything about what he has.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Fatty?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gainesville Green is still going around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen a real cut of Gainesville
Green in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a lot of fake cuts of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think about Fire Alien Ramen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was OG Rascal and it was a seed line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you have Cuban Black Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that incognito guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the ones he brought to the
table, along with Chem 3 and fake Mass
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Skunk.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, y'all getting, y'all getting
skunked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all getting skunked.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some stuff first class.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can feel you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely not unhappy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that's a, that's a good, good call.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it's stuff you know what it is
in the first place before you get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, I mean, things can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where some confusion also comes
in, because things can be dank,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a fake clone that's super
dank, probably even better than the,
[SPEAKER_01]: than the clone only.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, does that make it legit?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have to know the,
you have to be able to identify something
[SPEAKER_01]: in the first place before you can verify
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to know it in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the difference in Amherst Sour,
AJ Sour, ECSD?
[SPEAKER_01]: Amherst Sour, new to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like I get, like people were
saying it was from Amherst.
[SPEAKER_01]: So someone smacked Amherst on the front of
a Sour cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anything about that Sour cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only know ECSD, the Choco, same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The AJ Sour was very dank, but what AJ
considers his Sour now was nothing like
[SPEAKER_01]: the old AJ Sour cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, salt and lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never heard of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, like the Cuban Black Haze,
a lot of people like it, but is that what
[SPEAKER_01]: it is?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that it, I know the provenance
on it and that that guy passed two other
[SPEAKER_01]: fake cuts when he passed that cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Archive cut of Sour would be the same
thing as the Choco, the ECSD, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the same exact cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're comparing Archive versus Choco,
they're the same cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who was the original train wreck?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the original train wreck supposedly was
nothing like the train wreck that got
[SPEAKER_01]: pushed by AE32 and the Arcada train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was much different before that,
but the one that gets past the most is
[SPEAKER_01]: like that Lemon Eater Pinnelling one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what most people, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mandelkroch put the Amherst on the
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, no surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I think the AJ Sour I used was the
original Sour?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think the Choco ECSD is the original
Sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that's not one we can take back to
the total beginning, because there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: true agreement between the original guys
that had the Sour on what that Sour is
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think any of them could identify
it today by any stretch of the
[SPEAKER_01]: imagination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to get them to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Found an incredible train wreck,
Fino, in bubblegum breath crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is there a train wreck, Fino's,
in bubblegum breath crosses?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I don't know what bubblegum breath
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harold Timerson Amherst that said it was
the original Sour originally from New York
[SPEAKER_01]: Upstate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is from New York Upstate, but it was
not called Amherst Sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's ever called it Amherst Sour back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know, it was called Our
Diesel, and that's the original name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people can call whatever they
want, but they shouldn't if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about original Sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not super debatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly a couple of Sours at first,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other original name for it was the
Manny from those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is also that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what Mendo breath is,
basically Mendo Ferpsen train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendo breath is not Mendo Ferpsen train
wreck, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's OG Cush breath, and probably a Mendo
Ferpsen train wreck, but OG Cush breath
[SPEAKER_01]: being the main part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem Dog had fake Chem 91 in high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you trust what any of them say?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hard to argue with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there land races that get as commonly
knocked off as ties?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your opinion, what breeders are killing
it right now and why?
[SPEAKER_01]: A few episodes ago, I did a long list of
breeders that are people that I trust and
[SPEAKER_01]: that are doing some cool shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, hit back a few episodes and you
could probably find that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moontide, that's another fair statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like those smells don't necessitate a lot
more than most of the things associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with like the skunk thials and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunky thials are hermaphroditic
tendencies and low potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people want what they don't know and
can't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many old elites look like ugly ass
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess turps and highs were a bit more
important for a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in modern times, people equate
looking good with dinkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the Instagram era of
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't agree with that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the most beautiful shit like
Blackberry Kush is some of the worst
[SPEAKER_01]: potency on earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, Menopurps is fucking
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not super potent, you know, but it has
great turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Name any cookies hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's that fucking great,
but it's pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sells, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure yet, Pyramid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't run any yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, Gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene knows what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't smoke with your fucking eyes,
boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like the people that run towns.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a great example of how to
pick your weed and what to sell by THC
[SPEAKER_01]: volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people haven't even looked at the
entourage effect at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hog's Breath is a beautiful example.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't the most gorgeous, but it was
one of those ones that hyped itself
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was fucking dink.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Name fucking Gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna get Gene on here eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, he will do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He will do it and come hang out and shoot
the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think microbes and fungi and soil
contribute to the flavor of weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the root zone is where it does all
that exchanging of stuff, so sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think sulfur, added sulfur helps with
turps and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Favorite chem to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked Chem 1 because it was so different
than the other chems, and I like Giselle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, if we're just saying just
chem chems, well, I guess that would
[SPEAKER_01]: depend on what chem is, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem 91 and all five haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem 4 is one of my other faves.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's a strain that subverted your
expectations because of how ugly it was?
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombian black.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was beautiful to me because I knew its
potential, but it was just an airy mess of
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny little tiny little bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubbles of bud everywhere, but it was
amazing smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dalot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Dalot has a lot of that same look
that the Colombian black did, just
[SPEAKER_01]: stringy.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot like what people called Grinspoon
that was originally Quays.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened to Good Widow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the same thing that happened with
everything else from the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: People just overdid it, got sick of it,
lots of renames, lots of bad information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Impressions of weed that was not widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel now that tissue culture
has really started to gain momentum and
[SPEAKER_01]: become more available with honest people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask Fatty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever since I got screwed by Moony Moon Dog
on tissue culturing, I've stayed so far
[SPEAKER_01]: away from it and don't care because it's
just a bad experience, but I know my boy
[SPEAKER_01]: Fatty's been doing some cool shit with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dog Walker OG is kind of ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smokes fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's kind of pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smokes great though.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did not get the cut from Grayskull.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brandon did not get the cut from Grayskull
because Grayskull doesn't have the fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grayskull will tell you he doesn't have
the cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the last of Grayskull's bull rider
seeds and they weren't gonna pop,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we had to take him to a tissue culture
guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure what's up with that since then,
but Brandon did not get shit from fucking
Grayskull.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grayskull would never fuck with that kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, Brandon Rust is a noob,
but people just think for some reason
[SPEAKER_01]: because he says he's not that he isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are liars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta ask the people themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you ever smoke weed during
lives?
[SPEAKER_01]: One, I don't want to get them shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, I can't answer fast if I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried a few live and stoned and that
just doesn't work out well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either you want info or you want me
stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't have both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know that Gray ever had bull
rider.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had the seeds that we had here and
that's the bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was that as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just trust people because they say
they're legit and old school and they show
[SPEAKER_01]: a picture of a plant and veg saying it's
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just accept that as true,
please.
[SPEAKER_01]: I beg of you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't because all it does is fuck
everything up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where can I get some cuts of the Steve
Murphy Afghani?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you can find someone that'll sell
you some Steve Murphy Afghani if you keep
[SPEAKER_01]: asking around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure Brandon Rust will sell you some
of Steve Murphy's Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anybody currently keeping
cuts of Steve Murphy's Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is the CSI NL project going?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going great.
[SPEAKER_01]: They overgrew everything really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's obviously some kind of Afghani
hybrid, which is what we want from a NL5
[SPEAKER_01]: that gives more truth to what it's
supposed to be because we are always going
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep making sure that it is what we
think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what Steve Murphy Afghani is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or actually, as it was told to me,
it could be a Pakistani or Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a girl who went over and brought
them back to Steve Murphy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be a Pakistani or Afghani,
but it was picked up somewhere along that
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weasel with the Diesel say Sour D came
from his headband Siege, which is Cam 91
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Weasel with the Diesel has told so many
different stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Respect to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've heard too many different stories
coming out of dude's mouth to be very
[SPEAKER_01]: reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do know Vondo and Vondo has been
the most reliable and consistent when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to stories about the Sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, Weasel with the Diesel knows
Vondo too, and they were roommates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's been the most consistent and out
of the spotlight, wants nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: any fame, glory from Sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is Golden Coast Vintage Afghani?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a short, squat, little,
creamy, hashy Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing great, but it was pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know who Cosmic Wisdom is.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would we get a Shawnee Kidz?
[SPEAKER_01]: He just did an episode with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you describe the nose on
instruction on Pakistani Chitral Kush?
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the phenotype, you can get
like blackberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The green phenotype showed a lot of lemon,
and there's a lot of turpentine.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little baleen mixed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's other notes too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb would be the person.
[SPEAKER_01]: CSI would be the person to talk about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anywhere Vondo's story can be found.
[SPEAKER_01]: We brought Vondo into our circle and
interviewed him extensively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just told it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's about the best place you're
going to get it unless you're friends with
[SPEAKER_01]: him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you believe that Sour came from
headband?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys can't even agree on who named
headband, let alone any of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've watched several people from that
group, including AJJJ, and maybe one of
[SPEAKER_01]: them did name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But JJ says he's named it.
[SPEAKER_01]: AJ said he's named it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe Klopp said he's named it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weasel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one of them did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one of them didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Sour was before that, so it would make
it very hard for Sour to come from
[SPEAKER_01]: headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you pick a name for a strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ask me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come up with dumb ass names.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have autism and you're trying to
make friends and be social for cuts,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to be pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find a group that understands that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be hard pressed to find a group of
seed makers that are real serious into
[SPEAKER_01]: this and real serious into collecting that
aren't on the spectrum in some way,
[SPEAKER_01]: shape, or form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my best friends have some level of
autism spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blackberry was a bag seed by Somablaze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably MendoPurps.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of it's probably MendoPurps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find everything that they
described as Blackberry in MendoPurps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm guessing it's MendoPurps bag seed
that they didn't want to admit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Favorite turpinoline dominant clone?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the Amnesia Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombian black is another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fly to Portland and ship yourself some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thoughts on Breeder love in her eyes?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anything about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very new to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they're new to the scene
in general, but they're very new to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some pretty pictures though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nebu's Blackberry was from Sonny's Black
Russian.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black Russian was CherryAKA47,
Nebu's Blackberry, and Nebu's Blackberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blackberry was probably from MendoPurps.
[SPEAKER_01]: What makes an OG an OG?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's so many cuts out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just about there being similar
traits and a bag seed story?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roughly yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know anything about the blood Durbin CSIs?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a lot of different Blackberry
cushions out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sonny's Black Russian.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't Sonny's.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the Black Russian was Nebu's.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you tried to like the chem one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's very different from the other
chems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not super what people would associate
with chemi.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I think it would be great in a
cross with dog shit because they are both
[SPEAKER_01]: NL5 Haze dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably some skunk one in there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll get more of a traditional
Dutch NL5 Haze type by running across of
[SPEAKER_01]: the two than most of what other stuff you
could buy right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you growing now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put that on a back burner for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about it just because I don't
want people saying that they've made what
[SPEAKER_01]: I just made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched your original diesel episode the
other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever seen the form thread of when
ChemDog visited Subcool at his house?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Headband was one of the strains ChemDog
had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ChemDog himself has told me he's never
had headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it just depends on what day you
ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like ChemDog Greg.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unless you have copious notes,
it's been fucking X amount of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was really young when all that was
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to keep track of any of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urinal cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come smoke some urinal cake with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hockey puck urinal cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookhead Slut was a good name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you would really like this super
glue cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghani Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I see stuff like Northern Lights in a
lineage like that where there's no number
[SPEAKER_01]: to it, no nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then knowing which Northern Lights
were over here and which ones weren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be super dank, but I could never
use it in anything because I just can't
[SPEAKER_01]: chase the provenance on it and I can't say
what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless it was super exceptional.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be surprised if anyone remembered
anything after visiting Subcool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever seen any Ethiopian strains
making its way up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people that have sold Ethiopian
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you smoked the metal haze Bodhi is
about to release?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've smoked metal haze plenty and bred
with it, but I don't know about the one
[SPEAKER_01]: that he's using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything about Dr. Atomic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Been trying to get him on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get your F1 Durham back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any idea what the harsh chemical spray
paint permanent marker fumes type smells
[SPEAKER_01]: could come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Different terpenes, combinations of
thiols, terpenes, esters, etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is real Humboldt Seed Company?
[SPEAKER_01]: HSO, HSC, CSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, CSI is a Humboldt original.
[SPEAKER_01]: HSC was the first person to have Humboldt
Seed Co, but I have no respect for them
[SPEAKER_01]: for many other reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And HSO split off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I may be wrong, but as I've heard
it, one of the people split off from
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt Seed Co and started at Humboldt
Seeds org.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does the African haze come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which African haze?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like Senegal haze that was a
combination of two African land races with
[SPEAKER_01]: no haze in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working on Dr. Atomic,
but he's not a big internet dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's been a little hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think he'd be a great person to
interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been around a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, you know, made some cool shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple Man mentioned the clones.game were
covered in PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were the days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure on the African haze from I
just I haven't kept up on what what he's
[SPEAKER_01]: been working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions about provenance
clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that I might know about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you tried any transki South African
strains?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have tried transki, tried Swazi early
on, Durban.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't a big fan of South Africans,
if I'm being honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they tended to be high yielding
commercial grade for Africa, which is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dressed up for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dressed up for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thoughts on reversal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes plants don't sack up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more look like bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, different reversals go different
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did St. George make Girl Scout cookies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a bullshit story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is a story that keeps being spread
nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually tried to get a hold of him
to put his story on the record and they
[SPEAKER_01]: will not do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will not put it on the record,
but it would be easily trounced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did ask the original cookies dudes to
talk about it and we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully they will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully they'll be interested in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What turpene or combo of turpenes make
blueberries smell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mersene and then different doodly doods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever run out any of skunk man's gear back
in the icy mag days?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the Taihei skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else did I run a fucking?
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a bunch of freebies that were
given out by Sam the Skunk Man back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did run some of the stuff that they sold
through DNA as the skunk train that Sam
[SPEAKER_01]: had made too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is on Shingo Los talking about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: St. George?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, maybe he was just fucking being a dick
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, he's not the dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty well documented where cookies
came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty well documented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does a Trinity cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: You are all using a very turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the people who made cookies
know what it is, but don't really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't really want to put the full recipe
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I it's very easy to remake cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I've heard what Saint George says
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things where.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people want to take credit for it
that there's so much bullshit out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is up with Seed Stunky?
[SPEAKER_01]: That dude's a fucking lop.
[SPEAKER_01]: He chose to go with corporate assholes and
got booted from our scene of friends
[SPEAKER_01]: because he just chose to work with
snitches.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cherry pie, Pakistani, Chitrali.
[SPEAKER_01]: No way in hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: No way in hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you'd find constant turpentine digging
all that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no Urkel or OG Kush in that
combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants tell the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: People tell stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always go back to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookies was life changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Lord.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any backstory in Starfighter?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was already when I stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that came out, I had already stopped
paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Attention to everything like the new
people were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any work with you and Smell Boat on the
back burner?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Smell Boat's been doing his own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's you know, he's got he's a daddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he hasn't really been.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hasn't really been doing much,
but yeah, he's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it'd be nice to see him get back to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, because he grew really dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need always bring it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think cookies is OG Urkel?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a little bit more to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think most of these expressions that
you see in cookies is an OG Urkel
[SPEAKER_01]: combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, Eddie Leapfrog was
responsible for a green Sherb.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is different than the Cookie Fam
Sherb.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is more responsible for Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is just not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why there's a lot of confusion
around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard M39.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern Light Five Haze or just Skunk One
NL5.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's Skunk One NL5.
[SPEAKER_01]: NL5 Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some combo thereof.
[SPEAKER_01]: The male Pakistani Chitral was an Urkel
Morph.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get out of here with that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's fucking silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basic Five is the NL5 version that SSSC
was using in M39.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: NL5 Skunk Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any thoughts on Dick Horse genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Never heard of him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never heard of her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never heard of her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever ask the same question over and over
even though he keeps passing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you're referring to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to catch everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's about the hardcore OG clone from
West Coast Cuts now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anything about that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever try Malawi Gold NL5 Haze?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I expect to find in your cherry
GMO Skittles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some cherry pie, some GMO, and some
Skittles and everything in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most honest answer I can give
because there's tons of phenos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a polyhybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: What regs you got for something you'd
recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of the blue bonnet stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy with all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on what you like out of
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most honest answer I can give.
[SPEAKER_01]: Best way to stabilize a herm that's a
winner?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on the actual clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on what you want to get out of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want something that is as close to
that clone as possible, it's going to take
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of your current line, what's your
current go-to when you smoke?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the cherry berry a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Blue Resin Kush's fucking bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you stabilize a herm?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no just one method for stabilizing
all herms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Herms, things, herm for different reasons
and different lines and different
[SPEAKER_01]: combinations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Vlubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do love Vlubba, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did Bodhi make Appalachia?
[SPEAKER_01]: He did not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hein Lundsen made the Appalachia,
and that was green crap crossed a tray
[SPEAKER_01]: dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knows the true origin of the
Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene would know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's up there with those dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up for debates, apparently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people are more confident
about it than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about bubblegum and how it
got to Holland?
[SPEAKER_01]: Victor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I remember correctly, Victor was the
dude that brought it over, the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find it on Adam Dunn's 25th
anniversary of bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's when they had Victor and
Two Trees on, and that was the most
[SPEAKER_01]: legitimate, as far as I know, the most
legitimate story that has been given about
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say seedfinder.eu has legit
info?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, anybody could add any info.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never added a single strange
seedfinder in all my shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up there, and a lot of it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody could add info up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anybody could add info up there,
then there's bound to be right and wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Illinois bubblegum story is kind of
suspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was not a Victor story.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was an Adam Dunn story, so I don't
buy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there an Appalachia male?
[SPEAKER_01]: Appalachia was a seed line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there were males, females.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's an F4, F4, last by
Heinlonsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whose dick do I got to suck for some legit
green crack S1s?
[SPEAKER_01]: I made some back in the day, and if you
could find someone with those,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might make some more soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But green crack is much harder to source
than it was at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen so much green crack and so
much fake green crack since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene's 100% confident that nobody knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then Gene knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in that friend circle of everyone
that was fucking around with the trays and
[SPEAKER_01]: the green sherb and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: What strings are great for headaches?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on your brain chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to give people answers like that,
but I just wouldn't be honest to just be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, yeah, this will work for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to bring back the purple
drink back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't it GSC?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was GSC Cross II.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't remember them all in it,
but I know it was during the Suge Knight
[SPEAKER_01]: OG Cross to the West Coast dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to remember them all in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is fake green crack usually?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not real green crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a green crack is pretty easily easy
to identify visually or smoking wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is green sherb also called key lime pie?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people call it that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people say they're the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only ever had key lime pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had anything in my hands called
green sherb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene might know that one better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Butterscotch G13.
[SPEAKER_01]: G13 wasn't around when the butterscotch
wine was passed around, but there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: G13 hash plant that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has anyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dookie Rose Kettles Gittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one that CSI uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the Skittles cut that I know that
I've used.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a very healthy looking plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little wiry and wrangly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think, Gene, on the Dookie
brothers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I defer to guys like Gene and CSI that are
up in that area because they are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: interacting with those folks down on the
ground there and seeing things like down
[SPEAKER_01]: on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd be much better to answer those
questions specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Gittles cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing's a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get why people like it because it is
terpy, but it just, structure wise,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's got Skywalker OG?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a million different Skywalker
OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't key lime pie a sister to thin mint?
[SPEAKER_01]: Depends who you ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any insight on the green curry cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like whatever he had as the
green curry cut was the same thing that we
[SPEAKER_01]: had as Diablo OG down in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a spicy black peppery with OG
terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried the original chili verde that
actually smelled like chili verde back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the day from HBK.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very fucking unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other chili type plants in the GMO
Cherry Skittles, but yeah, that was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that chili verde was tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old school spice life blockhead,
no lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it Project 19?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: African something, Project 19.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long time since I've been
asked that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up with HBK?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't talked to him a lot in a while,
but I need to get back ahold of him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should probably give him a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: We live close together and we've been
friends for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess Burning Bush Nursery said key lime
came from them and it's a GSE Fino hash
[SPEAKER_01]: plant looking thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I released S1s of the key lime pie cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were very, very frosty, but they did
look, they looked very Skittles-y and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles looked very similar to that,
the cut that came from Jodri.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been bumming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that sucks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll give him a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: Males and world phylo-taxi, what gives?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it often on males in some lines,
specifically Chem 91, PCKF2.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily a male trait,
but maybe it's something from those
[SPEAKER_01]: specific genetics being combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Favorite shitty strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go, Ortega sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where's the Project 19 in it,
in blockhead?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it Project 19 Ortega sweet tooth?
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be what it is, but I remember
Ortega sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are correct about that being in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't that Louie?
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it P19 Louie?
[SPEAKER_01]: Louie being Legends Ultimate Indica,
since that's what Ortega sweet tooth is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it just P19 sweet tooth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Gittles Skunk 1 dominant?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not in structure at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terps, I can see some Skunk 1 in it,
but I wouldn't say it's Skunk 1 dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as the expression, the structure,
or any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Creamsodica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Creamsodica was from... That's a Spice of
Life one, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fatty, you guys did grow a bunch of the
blockhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had... Who was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Chrome's Cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chrome from Swamp Boys had an amazing cut
of blockhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the one that was down there
with T.R.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rojo's crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that cut of blockhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nigerian silk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never tried Nigerian silk or any of it,
so I couldn't comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did Burning Bush?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no clue on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to the progenitors of key
lime pie and that stuff, I have no clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever had any mango cuts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I had a BC Mango Cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mango Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old Betsy's kind of mango-ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Crack is very mango.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a bunch of different kinds of mango.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the Highwayman?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that district homegrown... Best
guess on closest relative to which?
[SPEAKER_01]: TK Stardog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Dot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was an old collective clone for a
certain place, and I remember there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: second Blue Dot that came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what was used in Dutch
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Dot stuff that was used to make
blowfish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not-so-headband L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eastside OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that the dude who wears all the High
Times medals?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the one that always talks about
Eastside OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your favorite plants for body
pain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry Terps for body pain,
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not someone to ask about the Old
Timer 1 stuff just because I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: British, and most of the British dudes
were, you know, all on the low down on Old
[SPEAKER_01]: Timer 1 stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only thing I had real experience with from
OT1 was the Old Timer's Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any vanilla and OG Terps on anything you
ever come across?
[SPEAKER_01]: Vanilla X18.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a good Vanilla Fino in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vanaluna had some, too, that were decent,
but vanilla is much different than OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leaf Doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has all the High Times Cannabis Cup
medals like he's a thug.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dude's entertaining, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's fucking entertaining as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's his name, Marcel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a pendejo, but he's entertaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's a fucking entertaining fucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think he knows shit about shit,
but he's entertaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: A mite doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that sounds more... The dude doesn't
even smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm correct, Marcel doesn't even smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some people smoke more than
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's times when I take breaks,
but if a person just doesn't smoke at all
[SPEAKER_01]: and says they're breathing, it makes it a
little hard to take it super serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't like judging people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, weed affects people
differently over the years, and sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: people enjoy it at a young age and not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to shit like that,
when you're fronting that hard,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't even smoke, get the fuck out of
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably wouldn't run anything with Gage
Green, anything, just on principle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree, Dooky Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot argue with that conclusion on old
fucking leaf doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I say he's entertaining,
I just mean he's a character.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, as far as being a character,
he's a character.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some people would call me a
character too, which is probably an insult
[SPEAKER_01]: to me, but I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, you ugly motherfucker,
where you at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is pretty fucking satanic,
if you ask me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope some of you guys got something out
of the talk on provenance, how to collect,
[SPEAKER_01]: why shortcuts don't necessarily work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you have any other questions,
I'm happy to answer them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be up on Patreon after this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the sound on?
[SPEAKER_01]: One second.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plant seeds, you number them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed one through 300, or one through 20,
one through 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we did about, I think only like 15
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 15 seeds on this finger hunt,
and the number 20 was just popping.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plant seeds, you number them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed one through 300, or one through 20,
one through 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we did about, I think only like 15
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 15 seeds on this finger hunt,
and the number 20 was just popping.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plant seeds, you number them.
The sound would be it,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit me up, I'll try explaining it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always feel free to jump on Patreon,
Discord, shoot the shit with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing all kinds of shit over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it's where everything,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flav421 knows what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flux and Jai made the GSC, no one else.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, lots of love, y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers!
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers!
Thanks for watching!
