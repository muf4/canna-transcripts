[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_02]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Natsodad, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're here with Heavy Days from the
podcast, and we wanted to talk with him
[SPEAKER_03]: about his journey through cannabis,
where he started, how he got into the
[SPEAKER_03]: podcasting period, not only that,
but taking that journey into breeding,
[SPEAKER_03]: into making seeds, and the whole political
climate in Australia, and how he's grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to start from the beginning with
you, do this kind of A to Z.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you get started?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did you get that spark for cannabis
in Australia?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, first off, I'll just say,
huge thanks for having me on, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure to be joined by some of my
favorite podcasts, so super stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, to your question, good question,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the Australian scene historically
has been just very fledgling and very much
[SPEAKER_01]: in the shadows of the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of wasn't a lot of notable figures
doing much when I first started getting
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in cannabis, which would have
been around 2013-ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was when I started getting really
serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think initially, the thing that
really was the light bulb moment for me
[SPEAKER_01]: was I actually tried some imported
Californian weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, wow, weed can be this
good?
[SPEAKER_01]: And prior to that, all I'd had was the
Australian equivalent of Beasters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a long time, I was like,
yeah, cannabis is cool, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, then you try this Californian
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember specifically, it was said
that it was Granddaddy Purple,
[SPEAKER_01]: but looking back with what I know now,
definitely was not Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very green and it had a very
generic sweet smell, not that sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: earthly smell you'd expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was nonetheless a light bulb
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next batch I got,
there was a few things that there was like
[SPEAKER_01]: some Jack Harrah, which wasn't Jack
Harrah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some Girl Scout cookies that
wasn't Girl Scout cookies, but there was
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it is the Purple Kush that
sort of goes around a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one made a very lasting impact on
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the ball got rolling from
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had done a growth before that,
but I got mediocre results and it was my
[SPEAKER_01]: first growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a bit dog shit anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you end up growing out like DNA or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a given.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your first grow, you don't know who's a
good breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're just going to get lost in the
marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I came back to it and I just started
getting interested in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time I was applying for
graduate school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of the entry requirement was
there was like this essay component and I
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't good at writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started writing these largely
speaking sort of opinion pieces on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and sort of the state of the
scene in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would talk about how I was sort of a
bit let down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would talk about how I was sort of a bit
let down by the Australian scene because
[SPEAKER_01]: from my perspective, the penalties for
growing cannabis were far less than the
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was a huge incentive to get
at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: The penalties are pretty minimal and yet
no one had really done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I sort of wrote this opinion piece
saying, I think the Australian scene is
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty apathetic compared to the American
scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like during the Reagan administration,
like people going to jail for just
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible periods of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just don't think the same legalities
were at play in Australia for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, I was just writing these
opinion pieces and saying, if you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: help get things legal in Australia,
we need to be more open because at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time I knew a bunch of like white collar
professional guys who grew, but they were
[SPEAKER_01]: totally in the closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't tell anyone about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sort of tried to encourage people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, the more you put this out
there, the more people accept that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: be like a family man with a job and still
grow on the side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to be a criminal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in a criminal organization,
you can have a normal family life and
[SPEAKER_03]: grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike the way I look right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so I think that was sort of how
I got my feet wet was I was writing these
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion pieces and I got to admit it was
all sort of guised as just an experiment
[SPEAKER_01]: for me to get better at writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just subject matter that I was
somewhat familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I guess, and this is probably the
part that I haven't really spoken to
[SPEAKER_01]: people much about, but I then got the idea
of like, well, let's do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you find is if you're like a
no-name person, like I was at the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you ask people, Hey, would you like to
come on this podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing they'll say is,
can you like send me something to listen
[SPEAKER_01]: to?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I have an idea of like what it's
going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're then like, Oh, you know,
you're actually the first person.
[SPEAKER_01]: People stop replying very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I remember specifically, at the time
Brothers Grimm was like just announced
[SPEAKER_01]: they were reinventing themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know who Duke was yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just knew Mr. Soul from like reading
online and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I reached out to him and I was
like, do you want to come on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, yeah, we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me some questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent him some questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like after a few replies,
he's like, what like organization do you
[SPEAKER_01]: work for?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh, it's like,
it's just sort of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he abruptly stopped replying.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone who's met Mr. Soul will know that's
pretty par for the course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then again, being a bit of a newbie,
I reached out to Swerve of CaliCon and a
[SPEAKER_01]: very similar thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He expressed interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after one or two replies,
just completely ghosted me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that point, I was sort of a bit
like, I don't know if this is going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just started following Duke because
I'd seen on the Brothers Grimm website
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, he was pairing up with Mr.
Soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had just asked a few questions in
the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he had posted about some 88 G13
crosses he had done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just sort of said, Oh, you know,
I read this line's pretty old and it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit inbred.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you find like it dominates the crosses?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think just a few questions like
that, he was sort of like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you seem to be interested in the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I just, I floated the idea
by him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I even linked him some of
those opinion pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that might've been what sort
of got him over the line a bit thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Oh, this guy seems to, you know,
it's not just like haphazard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: He seems to be sort of passionate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, then we did that and that went
really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ended up, we chatted for a couple of
hours and then we actually ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: probably staying on the chat for probably
an equal amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we chatted for like three hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we probably spent another three hours
just chatting afterwards about general
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we sort of developed a
rapport.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of it, he was like,
I'm going to do you a favor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't really know what he meant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought coming on the episode was the
fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so I just went to bed thinking that
was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what a once in a lifetime
experience to talk to like a professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like at the time, like, you know,
I was just a nobody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was really grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next morning I woke up and I
had an inbox from skunk VA and I'd never
[SPEAKER_01]: spoken to him at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my mind, you know, he's this
mythological figure in the story,
[SPEAKER_01]: very, and, and he was also very
inaccessible at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't online.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just basically said, Hey,
you know, Duke said I should message you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was all it said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I, and so then we ended up lining
up the episode, but a hundred percent,
[SPEAKER_01]: without a doubt, those two things
happening was definitely the momentum,
[SPEAKER_01]: which allowed the show to continue in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big get to get a skunk VA on for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he, he turned, he's a good,
he's a pretty good storyteller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also told the truth about about a,
you know, a lot of aspects of chem that
[SPEAKER_00]: were that people didn't wanted to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it probably sort of launched it a bit,
I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hugely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think not so dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said this in one of the breeders
syndicate episodes, not so long ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you said, listening to that episode,
he was, he was pretty honest about a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the years have gone by and I've
learned more about, you know, the behind
[SPEAKER_01]: the scenes of the various incidents he may
be spoke about, I did sort of start to
[SPEAKER_01]: gain a bit of an appreciation that like,
yeah, it did sound like he gave a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: honest recount.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like there's a lot of funny
things, not funny, but how can I put it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people, and you know, not so you
probably deal with this a lot too.
[SPEAKER_01]: People still constantly ask me,
you know, who's the Staten Island guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, what's a, what's a,
what's a bummer about that for me is that
[SPEAKER_00]: because he shunned the spotlight on the
forums, and anywhere else, he's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: the single biggest person responsible for
keeping the chems alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least for that period of time until he
spread them out a little bit to his friend
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he doesn't, and he brought the super
skunk West and he doesn't really get
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about and he doesn't want us to say
his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I asked if Staten Island was like an
acceptable, you know, yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was like, okay, he can call me
that, you know, so that's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and as, and as I learned more about
the story and sort of the interplay
[SPEAKER_01]: between, you know, skunk VA, not so dog,
some of the other characters in the scene,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Staten Island guy, I started to like
realize the story a bit more on the
[SPEAKER_01]: backend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually like really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can understand the Staten Island
guy's perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's, he always, like, you know,
obviously I've never met him or spoke to
[SPEAKER_01]: him and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know not so dog, you're,
you're very close with him, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just, I just sort of understood that
he was from that older guard, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, I keep to the shadows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, that, that was definitely
really interesting, but I think that was
[SPEAKER_01]: largely speaking, how I got into it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, you know, it all sort of
just started to gain a bit of momentum
[SPEAKER_01]: from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we just sort of branched out a
bit really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because everyone, you know, I owe a huge
amount of, um, you know, appreciation and
[SPEAKER_01]: gratitude to, to everyone in the first 10,
because as much as, you know, the first
[SPEAKER_01]: two I referenced gave me some momentum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there was a bit of a lull between
episodes sort of four to seven,
[SPEAKER_01]: where I had some people that I was
interested in, but maybe weren't super,
[SPEAKER_01]: super big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting people aren't who,
who like necessarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wants to hear about that moment,
but it's who we want to talk to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, definitely people like yourself,
um, mean, Jane and Bodie and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the big name guys in the first
sort of 10 to 12 episodes, which is hugely
[SPEAKER_01]: impactful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I honestly, all the time think about
how different it would have been if like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have those people, including
yourself, you know, I, I imagine I,
[SPEAKER_01]: I look at a lot of other podcasts and I
see it takes a long time to get a big
[SPEAKER_01]: following.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think I was very lucky to,
to get that sort of push initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some people that the community,
uh, likes a lot and some people that were
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting and stories that they wanted
to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that probably had a lot
to do with it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've always been super interested to
be frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that the fact that you like,
because our world is so underground,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like layers of what people know
about each other, you know, from like
[SPEAKER_00]: insider information.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I'm sure like, as you've been in the
scene now a while, you've heard a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when you're first getting involved,
you typically only know like legends or
[SPEAKER_00]: public personas, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even figuring out like who's who
can be, I, you know, I always looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: that because it's like, it happened for
me, like organically or Matt just being
[SPEAKER_00]: around the forums, being in the scene,
living in California for so many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I knew a lot of these people in real
life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but you're on the other side of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The planet, you know, and you're trying to
determine who to talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, you know, we're a quirky
bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did, how did that work for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, like trying to slowly figure out
like maybe not necessarily who was full of
[SPEAKER_03]: shit, but who was more, who's,
who's perspective aligned most with how
[SPEAKER_03]: you see the history going.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you start figuring that out?
[SPEAKER_03]: What was, what were some of the,
the steps in stepping stones in that
[SPEAKER_03]: process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a, what a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll, I'm probably, I haven't actually
super thought about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to give you the ideas
that are coming to my head right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but basically I think that,
um, I'll, I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably wasn't until like episode 40
or so that I actually was able to stop
[SPEAKER_01]: viewing every episode as like this real
fan boy thing in a sense, like I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: before every episode, I would get nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, fuck, I'm about to deal
with this big name dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, um, I just want to put that
out there that, um, yeah, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that definitely was the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a bit starstruck initially,
because, you know, as you guys said,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, these, um, really infamous
figures online who you just get little
[SPEAKER_01]: tidbits about here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think largely speaking, I didn't have
too many people messaging me saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, stay away from this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, there actually wasn't too much of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Except, except for my name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that was one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a lot about.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like maybe, but like, fuck those
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, um, like I always view it as like,
I've always said, you know, consistently
[SPEAKER_01]: that your episodes are some of my favorite
because I think that a lot of guests are
[SPEAKER_01]: very diplomatic when they come on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I liked the fact that it didn't feel
like that with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always felt very free flowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but to jump back to the question
quickly for a second, I think generally
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking, I just picked a few people in
the scene who I thought were really stand
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I thought, if, if the guest I'm
thinking about is sort of friends or cool
[SPEAKER_01]: with these people, then they must be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that probably would have been
the guiding sort of feature.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also I have to reference, I was lucky
enough to come visit the States probably
[SPEAKER_01]: within the first six months of starting
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to hang out with a lot of people
in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think that helped guide the
guest selection a little more,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like, I'll be the first to admit,
you know, there are, there are some
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes that I think haven't aged as well
as others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and there is a number of episodes
that are just not available anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's for a variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes the guest has requested it
to be taken down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other times we just viewed it as
inappropriate to keep it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, I think that the selection
has gotten better over time, I hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I certainly also think that I like to
chat to people a little bit before I get
[SPEAKER_01]: them on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other guiding principle I have is
that I don't really take requests so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people will message me and say,
Hey, can I get on the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they might be like a decent size
following, but I have always said,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in order to get a good episode,
I think I have to genuinely be curious
[SPEAKER_01]: about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not, it's just like a stale
conversation, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's, it's really hard when it
comes to, to guess, like, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: even with just doing the live streams for
a long time, there are so many of those
[SPEAKER_03]: that I look back on.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did not age well in my brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm like, wow, I was really friendly
with that person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And later on, I'm like, wow, I don't
really like how that went looking back,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you can't, you know, I mean,
you can only do what you do at the time
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and how it goes at the time and how
you're feeling at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I think like over years and years
and years, you, you, it's easier to go
[SPEAKER_03]: easier on yourself about the fuck comes
when it comes to stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's just so it's, it's a little
control of the people's actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, I think my opinion on it
actually has dramatically changed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to think about it where like,
to be honest, there was some people that
[SPEAKER_00]: you, you've had on does, I don't need to
name names or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's irrelevant, where I was
like, oh, that person, oh no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then over time, I think I thought
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I actually think to let people
really judge someone, it's really hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit for two or three hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like your interviews are pretty
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you give pretty open ended
questions and you let people talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and when you talk, that gives
the public a chance to see do I vibe with
[SPEAKER_00]: this person?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I like what they have to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I get a sense of who they are?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, people can't talk the
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that, and so that allows,
and I'm not, you know, good or bad or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it just, it just allows like,
because our, our, our, our scene is full
[SPEAKER_00]: of characters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's definitely reasons why
people like to be isolated and growing
[SPEAKER_00]: weed and not dealing with humans.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to have a certain risk
profile and people get into cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, like you give nice long
interviews and you let people speak,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I'll, I'll say this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was one of the people that gave you,
I think this is the first time we butted
[SPEAKER_03]: heads was during, and I'll say it be the
sub cool interview.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was super pissed at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've told you recently, like looking
back on that because Monty's no longer
[SPEAKER_03]: with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I am so glad you didn't listen to any
of us because, because regardless of
[SPEAKER_03]: whether me and him got along or what
happened, it, none of that matters because
[SPEAKER_03]: he did work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was important.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in a lot of people's gardens and
those, those stories need to be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to, whether they're accurate or
not, or whether, you know, he was right or
[SPEAKER_03]: not, doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to have those stories regardless.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was a major part of the scene for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had a choice on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was pissed at the time, but I mean,
cause there's, yeah, there, I just wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, I like now it's like,
even if, even if it's not somebody I
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer, like I like to hear what they have
to say, you know, because I'm always
[SPEAKER_00]: curious about people's perspectives,
you know, and, um, you know, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's an also thing where like,
there's this huge, there's this huge gig
[SPEAKER_00]: to like, um, you know, when you were
saying before, it's like, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that come on to be diplomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of people that are
coming on that are trying to project an
[SPEAKER_00]: image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's probably really relaxing for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when you get somebody on and you
just get a sense, Oh, this person's just
[SPEAKER_00]: being themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, I don't want to say it's rare,
but I can understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I do it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sometimes you've got your own
personal thoughts and then you've got more
[SPEAKER_01]: public thoughts you're happy to put out
there, but it is super refreshing when
[SPEAKER_01]: someone's very upfront.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, to sort of reference the,
the, the Monte interview you talked about,
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt, that was actually a very interesting
moment for me, because I didn't actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew there'd be some people unhappy with
it, but I didn't anticipate it would be to
[SPEAKER_01]: that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember, uh, old CSI left the
comment and it felt like over a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: likes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think our whole crew probably said,
yeah, it was, it was, yeah, I'd never seen
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, to the effect of like,
this ain't it buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah, I guess, you know,
sort of a related point I've been thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about recently is that, um, you know,
it's, it's, it's, it's kind of scary to
[SPEAKER_01]: think that three of the people I've had on
the show have passed away now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, being Monte bog and Jaime
Chiba.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot about, I forgot about Bob too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sometimes you lose sight of the
fact that like, um, yeah, some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: guys are a bit older and like,
you know, um, as you said, for better or
[SPEAKER_01]: worse, it is good to get their perspective
on some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it's tough if you're feeling
like some of the things they're saying
[SPEAKER_01]: might not be a hundred percent true,
but, um, if nothing else, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, I am grateful that I got to speak to
sub and interestingly, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I never put this out there, but like from
a technical level, it was a very
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, you know, some sub got a bit mad
at me throughout it and actually hung up
[SPEAKER_01]: the call at one point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think his friend told him that
that probably wasn't a good PR move.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he pulled me back and said that there
was internet issues, but it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was good to get his take.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I obviously, you know,
don't want to speak negative, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: because, you know, I think we all can sort
of look at the last few years of subs life
[SPEAKER_01]: and draw our own conclusions, but sub cool
definitely was the person who got me into
[SPEAKER_01]: growing organically with super soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think super soil is the best
nowadays, but it was a great stepping
[SPEAKER_01]: stone for someone who just never done
organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so yeah, for that reason, I had a bit
of a personal like thing with sub because
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you're the dude who got me and
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, um, you know, it was the rev
him and the rev.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I listened to your episode the other
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rev he was, he was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tried TLO and I had pretty decent
success with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I tried super soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had pretty good success with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I ultimately, um, just moved on
to sort of the more general no till,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's, it's, it's such a
minefield these days, but like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I felt an obligation to sub for
that reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he, uh, yeah, he, he showed me the
organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, anybody who came in during my
era, like 2006 to, you know, all the way
[SPEAKER_03]: up to 2013, like even me, like some people
that I entered in seeing it was DNA,
[SPEAKER_03]: but once you got past like the DNA
greenhouse, like, you know, Spanish bait
[SPEAKER_03]: and switchers, you get into the Americans.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was at the top of the game then,
you know, like all of us got into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even I was inspired by him young.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I have his first book thing,
you know, like I still have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was, it was an odd fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an odd fallout when we,
when we had our fallout, because,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, I did respect him and I did look up to
him at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just like, I was, I was his
antithesis, I guess, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes what I've learned is I've gotten
older sometimes just do people's energies
[SPEAKER_03]: just don't match.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to be a hate person or I
hate that dude or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just sometimes energies just don't
jive, you know, and that's definitely what
[SPEAKER_00]: it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: A slight digression, but we're connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started going over to
Amsterdam in the mid nineties and buying
[SPEAKER_00]: seats, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after I'd been there a number of
times, I started getting introduced to
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I realized was that everyone had
their own version of history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these old timers didn't like each
other and there was significant beefs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really illuminating compared to
today because you know, Matt and I talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about all the time, how you can pick any
hero from Neville to Shanti to art to all
[SPEAKER_00]: these different folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can kind of tear them apart if you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people have their favorites or
whatever, but there's a difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: like lasting contributions to the scene
and, uh, and, and you know, and being a
[SPEAKER_00]: good person and someone you get along with
and someone who you agree with their
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those two things are totally
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could make lasting contributions to
the cannabis seed game and to clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: to the gene pool and to the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could kind of have a variety of,
of, you know, personality quirks that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't that cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hugely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's only as I get more deep
into knowing people, do you realize how
[SPEAKER_01]: deep some of those divides actually run?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, something that's always lasted
with me is sort of this quote,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was, you know, I can't tell you who
said it, but it was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: considering we all smoke this plant that
chills you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of aggressive, unhappy
people in our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always thought that was interesting,
you know, cause it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe it's like that with every ultra,
you know, maybe in like the 0.01% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: craft brewing community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's like that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but like it is an
interesting point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, some of it is because
we come from a, a, a subculture of like
[SPEAKER_03]: the cowboy attitude of just like,
fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here, bring what you brung.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's there's obviously a big culture
clash going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have, we have the dudes who are
isolated, like to stick to themselves,
[SPEAKER_03]: move weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to deal with tax stuff or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to deal with the normal
business shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's why we're doing what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're merging with the,
the realistic climate of legalization and
[SPEAKER_03]: it is a hard clash of personalities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus we have two different generations,
maybe even three or four in some cases
[SPEAKER_03]: apart, trying to work together or not work
together, but it co-exist in the same
[SPEAKER_03]: sphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, it's definitely going to cause
some strife.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to know how you navigate that
when you're doing a lot of these
[SPEAKER_03]: interviews, when you hear, when you hear
something that maybe you don't love so
[SPEAKER_03]: much and you, and you want to push back,
but like, what, what, what, what is that
[SPEAKER_03]: dividing line for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And brings us to something I definitely
wanted to touch on with the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's okay with you, maybe I could chat
a little bit about our falling out and how
[SPEAKER_01]: that sort of guided my view on sort of the
question you just asked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it goes with what we were talking
about the heavy beefs, everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and, and I can completely
appreciate that there may be some people
[SPEAKER_01]: listening to this right now and going,
why is this guy on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a fan of him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can understand why you would have
that view.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the first thing I would just
say is like, I didn't like, so,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we had a falling out probably
about two years ago and I want to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred percent responsibility for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first thing I would say is that I
never wanted to really discuss this
[SPEAKER_01]: publicly until I was able to do it with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I just didn't feel it was
appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just sort of wanted to do it with
your permission, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think historically I always viewed
the interviews as like, my goal is to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the guests comfortable enough that they
share their inner monologue and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to it and then you decide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that would mean is sometimes
people would say things that I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: agree with or that I didn't like,
but if I push back in the past,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would get caged.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would close up and I sort of didn't
know how to handle that at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, I just felt like it was
better to just try to keep them
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable, keep them happy, let them
express their inner monologue.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they say something that's really weird,
hopefully the listener picks up on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we sort of go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometime about two years ago,
I had Gage Green on the show and I asked
[SPEAKER_01]: them specifically in one of our prior
episodes, we'd spoken about the Colombian
[SPEAKER_01]: black from Jojo Rizzo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had said, oh, I know that you and
Matt both had those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has said something to the effect of you
guys put them out cheap just to sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: get it out there so it wasn't valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they initially started out by giving
this sort of long-winded answer about how
[SPEAKER_01]: largely they try not to focus on the
negatives in their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was sort of a diplomatic answer at
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was sort of thinking, okay,
this isn't too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the end, he just went off
really left of field and essentially made
[SPEAKER_01]: an extremely inappropriate comment
relating to you and your childhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, in the moment I was taken
back and I thought to myself, this guy's a
[SPEAKER_01]: scumbag and it's crazy he just said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the moment, I tried to voice some
opposition to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking back, I wish I'd given a much
stronger rebuttal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe I said something to the effect
of I can agree with most of what you just
[SPEAKER_01]: said.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to acknowledge that it
actually, it wasn't a strong enough
[SPEAKER_01]: response on my part to what he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more importantly, I thought that
people would listen to that moment and
[SPEAKER_01]: basically go, this guy's a scumbag.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also thought that largely speaking,
you and him had had conflicts in the past
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was sort of just two people
flinging insults at each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, as time went by, I realized I had
made not only a grave mistake,
[SPEAKER_01]: but one that I was deeply apologetic and
sorry about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the reality is the simple
truth is that there's no place for
[SPEAKER_01]: comments like that on a cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I definitely want to take
responsibility for that going to air.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, you know, as the editor of
the show, the buck stops with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if I didn't say the comments
myself, I have a responsibility because
[SPEAKER_01]: they went to air and that's under my sort
of leadership, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was actually really grateful because
it was actually not so dog who messaged me
[SPEAKER_01]: and he let me know some info that allowed
me to sort of reflect on the situation and
[SPEAKER_01]: realize just how inappropriate it was that
those comments had gone to air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I specifically wanted to say,
you know, thanks not so dog, because I
[SPEAKER_01]: always have felt grateful in the manner in
which you approached me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very humanistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like coming in hardcore like
you're a fuckhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, hey, just want you to know it
would be cool, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always been very grateful for
that response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it was very telling of you
as a person that even though, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd essentially done something bad,
so to speak, to your buddy, you were
[SPEAKER_01]: still, you know, kind enough to come in
and give me the sort of that gentle
[SPEAKER_01]: influence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that I was very grateful for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since that time, I have been applying a
much more accurate active level of
[SPEAKER_01]: moderation to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is sort of getting to the crux of
your original question, which is that I
[SPEAKER_01]: realized that there just is some things
that get said that you have to give
[SPEAKER_01]: pushback to because the reality is there's
going to be some listeners who just don't
[SPEAKER_01]: find what the guest has said to be
acceptable or like maybe it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: insulting to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you need to provide some amount of
feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these days, I try to provide some
degree of feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if someone says something I don't like,
I'll try to come in and say, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like, what about this angle?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't seem like you're considering
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to give some degree of feedback,
but I also apply like a sort of more
[SPEAKER_01]: active level of moderation in that in the
past, I literally would not take anything
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guest said, unless they asked for it
to be taken out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas nowadays there may be some things
I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just, we're a bit off topic here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not appropriate or relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think overall, it's definitely a
continual learning process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I sincerely apologize for any
harm or distress that that caused.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I take full responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I view it as a very big learning
experience in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: One that I'm not proud of, but I'm glad
that I hopefully have grown as a person
[SPEAKER_01]: and can recognize that that wasn't right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to make that mistake
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to let you eat crow totally
because you did try to reach out to me and
[SPEAKER_03]: I just totally blew it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, it took me a long
time over, over cause I can hold the
[SPEAKER_03]: grudge and people that know me and have
known me over years know that I can hold
[SPEAKER_03]: the fucking grudge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like no one's business, but there were
certain things about that, that I took
[SPEAKER_03]: very personal, but it wasn't necessarily
from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was from, it was because the dude knew
me personally and had personal info about
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing was that not everybody
listening knew that because it could have
[SPEAKER_03]: just sounded like a fucking mean slander
at the time, you know, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it took me a long time, but when we
finally spoke, I was very glad because it
[SPEAKER_03]: was, you know, that was heavy on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I had you out to our, our can
Illuminati party.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I liked you, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm stoked that we moved past it,
but I was mainly asking you because I am
[SPEAKER_03]: learning that process now myself,
you know, like you had the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, we started this way after and I've
slowly learning like, okay, there's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be people that like, I might have to
edit what they can say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know where to draw this
line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know, like, is it,
is it different between each person?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, do you just try to draw a line based
on that person and how accepting they are
[SPEAKER_03]: certain?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've come to appreciate what you've
put together a lot more, a lot more being
[SPEAKER_03]: on the other side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and so you, you know, I appreciate
the, the apology, but I apologize as well,
[SPEAKER_03]: because you know, you were reaching out,
you were trying to communicate and I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't communicate back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, that's all it took.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was always the shining star trying
to like be cool with everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, you know, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think it was very effective for a lot
of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's showing them exactly the kind of
person that Gage Green was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's why I never asked you to
take it down to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, so there's that, I mean,
it, it obviously sucks, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in that regard, but I mean it,
and you know, as far as like me reaching
[SPEAKER_00]: out to you or whatever, like, I mean,
Matt knows this very well, like one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons why I'm even public is I'm trying
to build community and culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as sort of like a bulwark
against all the changes that are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, I try to like in,
on IG and all that, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you mentioned about like,
not just like flaming you or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, like there's a lot of,
there's a lot of, of that kind of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like snippy back and forth thing that goes
on in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that's like particularly
conducive to anything positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I always try like,
you know, to reach out and see if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: like common ground or to like show someone
your point of view and maybe you can bring
[SPEAKER_00]: them along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always try to be open to that as
well, you know, because to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: like being a good person doesn't mean you
don't make mistakes or fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means that you try to learn from
it and you try to, you know, make amends
[SPEAKER_00]: when you do and you like being a good
person is a work in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and, and that kind of,
and so it's not like you never make
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never look back and be like,
Oh man, I wish I would have handled that
[SPEAKER_00]: differently because that's asking for
perfection, which is far different,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think you ever did anything
out of maliciousness.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a whole nother thing to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, there's never anything mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you didn't do it to be mean to me
ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always appreciated that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even when I was fucking mean, you're never
fucking mean back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate that dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I feel pretty goddamn mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look in all honesty, I think during that
time period where we weren't chatting,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just tried to appreciate that anything
you said, uh, the feelings were
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially warranted and I couldn't,
I couldn't deny, you know, that this
[SPEAKER_01]: person is understandably probably not
happy with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I think that was part of the
learning process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to speak to not so dog's point,
I definitely, um, am a big advocate and I
[SPEAKER_01]: try to tell everyone that, you know,
that like, before you go and rip someone's
[SPEAKER_01]: head off, drop them a line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and because one thing I know for sure
having, it had a bit of experience in like
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of the mental health field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've realized that there's, there's a very
common saying you hear in that,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is like always assume ignorance
before like, um, maliciousness,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is like, chances are when someone
does something to piss you off,
[SPEAKER_01]: they probably didn't think about it hard
enough to wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably wasn't like any, and I've
certainly learned a lot from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not to try to, you know,
take any, um, onus of what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely can resonate with that,
that sentiment that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think our community would be a much more
hospitable and friendly place if everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: just sort of tried to, yeah, exactly what
not so dog said, you know, just message
[SPEAKER_01]: someone in private, you know, chances are
they'll respond positively and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks for letting me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we make it better?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like generally speaking, I've had that
response from people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I hadn't, I had just
completely blacked it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, after that, it was just like,
I'm not going to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a Tom Hill episode happened and I
was like, wow, this is a good episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knocked it out of the park.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I mean, you, I finally got
to hear how much you've grown and have
[SPEAKER_03]: listened to several other episodes since,
and I'm really proud of you, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: How far you've come to it's it's pretty
exceptional.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the, the Tom Hill one was a massive
get and a huge, I think a huge achievement
[SPEAKER_03]: for the whole community, because nobody
had really ever talked to him for a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time and had him put all that down on
record.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you asked him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the most amazing questions that
anybody could have asked him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So mad props on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody hasn't listened to it yet,
go check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you're too kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, if, if any episode is strikes
you as particularly good, it's because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the guests, not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, all, all props to Tom
for everything he's done in the scene and
[SPEAKER_01]: for being willing to share that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more importantly, I've been,
I've been very adamant about this from the
[SPEAKER_01]: start.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wholeheartedly believe that,
you know, you guys will be able to coax a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole different library of information out
because you can probably relate to this,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're doing an interview,
often, you know, they say something and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, Oh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's follow that trail of thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you forget to ask something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I think that there's so much
stuff that we didn't get out of Tom that
[SPEAKER_01]: we do need to get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's going to come out
when you guys go and visit him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Lord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will, I will disagree with you a little
bit there in the sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're being too humble in that
interviewing people, I think, and talking
[SPEAKER_00]: publicly is a skill.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I definitely think that,
you know, you do something more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably learn what questions to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you probably got better at
researching the, your subjects and trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to think of good questions that your,
your listeners might want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I mean, I personally,
when we started doing the podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: I started listening for all the weird
verbal ticks that I had that I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: realize, because you don't realize you
have them in normal conversation and you
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to yourself and you're like,
Oh man, I need to get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so talking, talking in public is hard,
even if it's prerecorded or whatever else
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, it's definitely a skill and
being entertaining.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, not even that, like with
cannabis, there's so much, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially, I mean, you can interview a
lot of people in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes seeds and it's even if you have
no knowledge about breeding, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: really matter because odds are either.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you want an interview,
someone like Tom Hill is a whole nother,
[SPEAKER_03]: a whole nother aspect because he's going
to tell you you're stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you ask him a stupid question that
makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there is, there is, you know,
it's guests are great and all that,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there is a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't know you get, and you get the
wrong guest, that can be really
[SPEAKER_03]: catastrophic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of those guests that could
have gone really catastrophic if you
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't know your shit, because he will
call your ass out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm proud of you for that one,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you, and you remember to ask about the
chemist and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you in all honesty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, Tom, Tom's a great guy who let
you know when you're wrong, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: good trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed our chats with him and,
um, you know, he's a, he's a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that we're able to get that some
of that info out from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and hopefully at some point,
someone can touch base with the chemist,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be really cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there is, there is, there is a
chance, uh, that, you know, he doesn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: he doesn't live too far from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, he lives, he lives, you know,
he never mentioned exactly where he lived
[SPEAKER_00]: on your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but he lives probably like,
uh, on one of the most famous roads in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino, uh, for cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I would literally call where he lives
sort of like the beating heart of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the, of the Emerald triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he's lived there since the
eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could literally, like, I actually
thought you did a good enough job,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, on, on a lot of the genetic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, man, maybe we'll just talk
about life in Mendo and growing up like in
[SPEAKER_00]: a subculture because like, I live in a
bubble, but where he lives, that's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble within a bubble within a bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, it really is like I, it,
it, people don't know how much that
[SPEAKER_00]: little, that area that he lives in and
what kind of world he comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the chemist is supposedly his neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe if I end up going up there and
chatting with him in person, which he says
[SPEAKER_00]: he prefers, like, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but there are a lot of old time
breeders up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's, that's one of the
interesting things is because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you, you have a tendency,
which is very obvious, like to interview
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are currently selling seats,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to be like a commercial seed seller,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those are the people that get
their name out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of those people got their start
from people that have never been
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial seed sellers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They took a bunch of that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when you talk to Tom, he was like,
you know, most of Tom's most famous stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: is the stuff that he liked the best from
the chemist stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just improved with the exception of
the haze, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the rest of it was pretty much
just, it was the stuff that was,
[SPEAKER_00]: he got from older people in the
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think that's a big thing
that a lot of people miss where a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people think current breeders kind of come
out of nowhere and they created all this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff from themselves, but they all had a
starting material as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times that we all stand on
the shoulders of those who came before us
[SPEAKER_00]: and we just popularized certain things,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say something I've
certainly learned, which resonates with
[SPEAKER_01]: that is that as time goes by, you realize
a lot of the people with the big reps,
[SPEAKER_01]: it may have been just because they were
particularly vocal or loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of the people you're
referencing, they just, they weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: putting it out there, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I will say that the skillset
required to survive in cannabis during the
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition era was very different than
like the show my face, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: burner publicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is putting your name on a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like trying wanting to know people,
people to know who you were and that you
[SPEAKER_00]: were responsible or associated with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in America, a lot of people that
didn't actually create the strain just
[SPEAKER_00]: became associated with it because they
were the first people to become famous
[SPEAKER_00]: around it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and a lot of people got scared
and like, you know, you know, hide in the
[SPEAKER_00]: shadows, you know, for a variety of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, unlike the king of cannabis,
we saw Matt hold up too long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's our guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see that they put out the like,
you know, cookies is opening their own
[SPEAKER_01]: seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see greenhouse seeds in the tag.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's he going to add?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I really, I genuinely want to know
what's going to be on the menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's his contribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I think like Ariane is,
is the prototype burner for in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sure a burner could learn a lot
from him when it comes to seed banking and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for one thing, cookies opened up a
smoking lounge, I believe in one of
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouse's coffee shops in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the collab, the collab,
if you will, started early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Arjun, for all,
all of you could, there, there was a,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's going on in America now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was two camps in Amsterdam and one
of them was sort of like the, the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: history and the weed nerd camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other camp was like straight
businessmen who were looking to market
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, and, and make a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Arjun was extremely successful at the
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was an, he is an extremely successful
businessman.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's probably the wealthiest dude in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he can teach burner how to go get
Spanish seeds, who to everyone to
[SPEAKER_03]: introduce him to.
[SPEAKER_03]: You no longer have to use these front men
like, you know, whoever they're using that
[SPEAKER_03]: for the smaller companies that are repping
cookie stuff, you can just buy direct from
[SPEAKER_03]: the Spaniards.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the, I'm sure they have a
beautiful business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet, I bet Arjun's angle is that for 25
years, his town was the center of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis seed universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's shifted to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably greenhouse getting promoted by
cookie in California will probably drive
[SPEAKER_00]: sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure their sales are far,
far down from what they used to be when
[SPEAKER_00]: they were the primary place you went to
get seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, the attitude is popping up
in the U S now, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know who's running that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, uh, yeah, I, I, uh,
greenhouse, probably greenhouse coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: shop is probably the prototype cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, something that sort of jumps to
mind when we're talking about this is that
[SPEAKER_01]: I did want to try to slip it in at some
point in our chat is that I, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I really wanted to encourage people to
consider their own personal weaknesses
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and try to address that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we've been talking, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we've just said, you know,
Arjen and Berner both great businessmen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all know that there's a lot of
great cannabis, um, people in our
[SPEAKER_01]: community who are maybe good at
cultivating, but not so good at the
[SPEAKER_01]: business side or maybe vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that one of the ways we can
stop everything going to shit long-term is
[SPEAKER_01]: through, yeah, trying to encourage people
who are like the heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, you know, the guys who we align
ourselves with to try to get a bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: business savvy, you know, it's always
beneficial to try to improve your
[SPEAKER_01]: deficits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something I'm learning myself
all the time is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's easy to assume that like,
you know, yeah, I'll start a company and
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I don't, I can just do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you just make a website and you
just, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you start to really get into
the business world a bit more,
[SPEAKER_01]: you realize like, Hey, no, I was actually
selling those guys short.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a whole unique skillset that I
don't have at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably beneficial if I try to
cultivate some of those skills myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So highly encourage people to like be self
reflective and consider your own personal
[SPEAKER_01]: weaknesses in terms of, you know,
are you just limiting yourself to one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing and, and, you know, listen to some
audio books, look at people who are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it successfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what we've just said, you know,
plenty of people have walked this path
[SPEAKER_01]: before us and they can show you maybe some
of the areas you could do things better
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's certainly where I'm at in my
life now is trying to recognize all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: areas where I might be a little deficit
compared to others and trying to become a
[SPEAKER_01]: more well-rounded person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think there's only advantages to
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's a good spot for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you, when you got into the idea of
wanting to start making seeds and see your
[SPEAKER_03]: own creations and see all this stuff,
you obviously were working with,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, what you're working with at the
time based on your, your education level,
[SPEAKER_03]: how has that changed now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what, what, where are you at in
your, your seed career now, as far as what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're working with, what direction do you
want to go and how has it changed where it
[SPEAKER_03]: started?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's actually a brilliant
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think the answer is going to be
a little counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first started making seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is actually before I started the
podcast or anything, I was just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, some dude in Australia,
just making seeds for him and his friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time I had already completed my
undergraduate degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a dual major, one in organic
chemistry, the other in molecular biology
[SPEAKER_01]: and genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually have a degree in genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the few people making seeds that
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I found was that besides the most
basic principles, it actually wasn't that
[SPEAKER_01]: applicable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started to realize that I didn't,
I didn't actually think it was a real
[SPEAKER_01]: credential after a while, because for me,
for example, the majority of people who
[SPEAKER_01]: have a degree in genetics or molecular
biology, it'll largely be focusing on
[SPEAKER_01]: human biology, like eukaryotic biology,
not plant biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if largely speaking,
if you understand the principles of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Punnett squares and Mendelian
genetics, you don't need to go too much
[SPEAKER_01]: further because when you do a degree in
this sort of stuff, you then move to
[SPEAKER_01]: humans and you start talking about,
you know, proto-onca genes and tumor
[SPEAKER_01]: suppressing genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these things just don't exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I came into it thinking, I've got this
background.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if I can use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I basically found as time went by
is that like, I don't feel like that
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically has made me any better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that largely speaking,
the things you hear our community commonly
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about are true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that empirical observation is like
hugely important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just having experience making seeds,
looking at different plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I try to stress to people
in Australia is you're limited by your
[SPEAKER_01]: exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have lots of people who message me in
Australia and they say, Hey man,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this super killer clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, have you ever tried a USA
clone only?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you might and be like,
Oh, my, my clone is actually not very good
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I say to people, you know,
if you're growing your first ever plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and you take a cutting of it, by
definition, that's a keeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got nothing else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you get more exposure, you get
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, the thing that's helped me
specifically is to just have had time
[SPEAKER_01]: making seeds, popping them, just sort of
seeing what comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then obviously there's also the side
of it, which is like the podcast and what
[SPEAKER_01]: people say, how does that play into it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think honestly, as time's gone by more
and more, I've become more in line with
[SPEAKER_01]: the sentiment that Bodhi expressed on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is basically that the proof's in the
pudding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't judge anyone until you've grown
their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's good work, then like,
what are you going to criticize?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I like to think of it as
though we've got all these tools and the
[SPEAKER_01]: reality is the more of those tools you
incorporate into your repertoire,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's probably more likely you'll have
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, that's not to say
you can't haphazardly make the next
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies because we can all point to
various bag seed, that have gone on to
[SPEAKER_01]: become clone onlys and they take the world
by storm.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, yeah, it's great to have all
those tools in your toolkit, but I also
[SPEAKER_01]: think that you shouldn't limit yourself
because you don't have a genetics degree
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever, you know, like make some
seeds, like do something that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: passionate about and you'll probably find
you get better results.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're crossing stuff together,
just cause you're like Jelenaid cross,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever is going to sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like you probably won't get too much
out of that in terms of like fulfillment
[SPEAKER_01]: or experience, but doing things you're
passionate about, going through the
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers and tying it back to what DJ short
said, you know, the real way to tell if a
[SPEAKER_01]: male is good is to pop the seeds and find
out, you know, that's the only way,
[SPEAKER_03]: the only way to actually run the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, obviously you can
be a good breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not all like random or anything like
that, but I think that people shouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: like trick themselves into thinking that
they can't make something really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they don't have a degree in
genetics or they don't understand this
[SPEAKER_01]: certain thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have access to tissue cultured
cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I just would really want to
encourage people to get on board because
[SPEAKER_01]: as time goes by, the more I myself
encourage the people around me to make
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what's going to keep you passionate
over the longterm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more people do it with like
honesty and passion, the better it'll help
[SPEAKER_01]: combat, you know, stuff which maybe is
produced from a more financial point of
[SPEAKER_01]: view.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one comment I'll add to that,
other than I basically totally agree with
[SPEAKER_00]: it is, you know, I talk all the time
about, um, there's kind of two sides to
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of it, one of it is some like basic
information, but then the other is the
[SPEAKER_00]: eye, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of look at the eye as like the
artistic side of it, where you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to have an immense amount of technical
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: To create something great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to have enough of a sense
and enough of the eye and enough of being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to smoke and tell, you know,
and, and also on that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, read what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the, the best way to breed
in my opinion, isn't to grow what you
[SPEAKER_00]: think other people will be hot on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more to like, be like, here's these
two strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get things I like about each one of
them in the same thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe it'll give me something
unexpected, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then on top of that too,
the most important part of weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: the high is invisible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't actually see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to test it and you can't really
test it with, with testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to test it the old fashioned way
by consuming and then get feedback on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so I like that you came around to
that side of things because, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when I went in out here in,
uh, as cannabis is becoming legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're starting to meet with a bunch of
big ag people and they just can't believe
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't believe how, you know,
I don't even know the term to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably think that the cannabis gene
pool is just nuts because they're used to
[SPEAKER_00]: growing these strains of vegetables or
fruits or whatever, that have decades of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding out of all these universities
that they bred them to be extremely like
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable to these certain traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of IBLs all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then comes this big crazy manic,
very poorly documented cannabis gene pool
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't do anything they think it's
going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a mess, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But to us, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful mess, you know,
but to them, they're like, how do I make
[SPEAKER_00]: an IBL out of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It does the exact same thing in the whole
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's funny you mention that because the
Australian legal medical scene is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is really starting to take off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of only occurred in the past two
or three years, but it's really starting
[SPEAKER_01]: to take off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really fortunate that I've been
able to be involved with a few facilities,
[SPEAKER_01]: be it like consulting or even looking at
maybe trying to get some of my genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: into the facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most crazy thing, which relates to
what you just said, is that one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities told me that they had spent
millions, like literally $10 million from
[SPEAKER_01]: the moment they started the company until
the end of their first year of operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was because they hadn't been able
to put out a single successful crop in
[SPEAKER_01]: that first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're paying overheads for this huge
facility, whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was basically because they said the
first six months, we had to teach our
[SPEAKER_01]: growers to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second six months, we had to
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, you guys didn't know this is
what to expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they thought, like what you said,
they'd pop a seed, it would be the exact
[SPEAKER_01]: plant they wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like, oh, you got to hunt
through this and then propagate the keeper
[SPEAKER_01]: up and then get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very eye-opening that the big ag,
who had all this money, seemingly had so
[SPEAKER_01]: little insight into the very foundational
practicalities of growing plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that when I worked at the grapery
and I was doing that big fem reversal on
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, some of these are some of the
best grape growers in California that have
[SPEAKER_03]: been doing it 50 years plus, like growing
some of the best, most expensive grapes
[SPEAKER_03]: sold in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were shocked.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had no idea what to expect from
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't understand the lack of sex
control that we have over the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: plant in the first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is totally baffling to them that we
can't control the sex very well through
[SPEAKER_03]: environment or spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we can reverse it, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, as far as keeping it female and
100% non-staminate, like they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: understand that because sexual stuff isn't
as plastic in a lot of the plants that
[SPEAKER_03]: they work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it is a whole different ballpark.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a weird plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very weird plant among plants even.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just weird from humans to plants,
but actually plants to plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very weird plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hugely, hugely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different game down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's cool to see the medical
market opening up in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would actually love to see, like there's
no, surprisingly no one from America has
[SPEAKER_01]: come over here and like just set up
something that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as it stands, all of the
Australian producers are not really
[SPEAKER_01]: producing a good quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all sort of midsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only decent herb you can buy is
imported from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can already tell that it's not
the best of the best, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that someone comes and sets up a
facility in Australia and just crushes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's sort of yet to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the second Thailand opened up,
Cookies was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm kind of surprised that Australia
just has been a blank spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to have a dream of being wealthy
enough to avoid winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would spend half the year in
Australia avoiding winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I used to see these grows posted
from Northern Australia by people growing
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's haze outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually had a climate that they
could grow like these beautiful sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and finish them without getting
cold and getting ruined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I never really did anything serious
about it, but I always kind of had this
[SPEAKER_00]: back in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, maybe I could go to Australia one day
and grow all these different plants in my
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard that I could never do in NorCal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, please come on over.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know the Aussie fans are going to be
super bummed if we don't talk about some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the heroes from over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And where do we begin?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you want to start with?
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a much better grasp of it,
but please.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, I think for a lot of people,
the obvious thing would be like wanting to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about like Neville or Shanti or any
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in all honesty, I actually
listened to your episode talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the older European guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think people should just listen to
that if they're interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there was so much information about
the seed bank that I just didn't know that
[SPEAKER_01]: I got out of listening to you guys hash
that one out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think we'll touch on them,
but I'd love to touch on some people who
[SPEAKER_01]: the international audience may not be
quite as familiar with, but were like
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty focal people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it might in fact be the people
you're referencing, not so dog,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's this crew called the Wizards
of Oz.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was made up of two dudes,
largely speaking, Wally Duck, who goes
[SPEAKER_01]: online by the name Donald Mallard.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's on IC mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of the moderators.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a very well-known dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another guy called moon unit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third guy you probably
familiar with or heard the name of his
[SPEAKER_01]: Kanga Tiva.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those three guys are what I would
consider to be like the, the dudes who are
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of like me, but a few years ago where
it was like, a sort of notable guy you
[SPEAKER_01]: could point to from the Australian scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And largely speaking, there hasn't been
too many others, but what they did that I
[SPEAKER_01]: love was not only were they growing like
cool tie stuff and the mum Bimbi Mad and
[SPEAKER_01]: all that, but they were actually working
on trying to make some unique hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Donald Mallard is the guy who brought
the duck's foot to the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how he got that name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've done an interview with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a sort of interesting story,
how it came about, but he sort of,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not too dissimilar to ABC.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, he just sort of got it given to
him and he was like, wow, this is a real
[SPEAKER_01]: mutant plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sort of went from there,
but they're, they're notable for doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: Z 99 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a cross of Zoid fuel and an F4 C
99 from the original heavens stairway
[SPEAKER_01]: stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was interesting about that was
that the Zoid fuel is a super interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made by moon unit on his own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he basically did what Neville said he
could never do, which was he spun together
[SPEAKER_01]: three land races to make something that is
like very representative or akin to modern
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He basically took a Chinese Yuan,
a P and G gold and an Australian heirloom
[SPEAKER_01]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably like an acclimatized tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: He spun those together to make something,
which to me looks very similar to like an
[SPEAKER_01]: amnesia haze or something like that,
except the high is like a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_01]: anxiety from that P and G gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, while he, when he was a homie,
he told me that was like the white well,
[SPEAKER_03]: the P and G gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a buddy who reckons he might have
some, I'll send it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he wants me to send some stuff to
the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we might look into doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'd love to see people grow it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a big plant, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do a group project on it between the
two podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that a hundred percent anxiety
isn't my favorite buzz.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not mine either, but it's one that
everybody faces and it usually ends in
[SPEAKER_03]: hallucinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It exists in weed and it is strange
sometimes what different strains give
[SPEAKER_00]: people anxiety and others relaxism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that very interesting, but yeah,
the a hundred percent anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crawl out of your chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's always an interesting
description.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever run into smoke and moose much
in your, in your research in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Australian stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do remember the name from IC mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have much history with him?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was on a Mr. Nice forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has friends with me, Wally and,
and a moon unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was one of the guys that a lot of
us like looked up to as an elder in the
[SPEAKER_03]: scene, but I don't know much more about
like his actual history in Australia,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I knew him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know him and Tony Muller way and a few
others are real big out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have much info on Tony?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's, he's still doing his thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been providing, um, like,
so I've, I've met him, I think two or
[SPEAKER_01]: three times over the past few years,
just haphazardly, not, not at like events,
[SPEAKER_01]: just randomly bumping into him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, um, he's a, he's a big dude in the
underground medical scene in the sense
[SPEAKER_01]: that, um, he, he would give medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: To really sick people before, like before
you could really get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's definitely like an OG in terms of
having provided a lot of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, RSO type medicine for people who are
really sick over the past 20 or so years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he definitely gives out a lot of seed
that, um, he says, you know, if you grow
[SPEAKER_01]: this and you want to make RSO,
it's, it's going to be good genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually not familiar with what the
genetics he gives out, but he is,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's definitely a known dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He hasn't got online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, there's a few guys like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and he's more of like, uh,
uh, a local legend in like Nimbin,
[SPEAKER_01]: that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nimbin's a bit, is that like your Humboldt
out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is and it isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, the Australian scene is very
interesting because there's a huge divide
[SPEAKER_01]: between the old guard and the sort of
younger generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old guys, largely speaking,
they like smoking, but they're,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're also equally driven by,
um, financial motivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like things have to yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, those sort of factors, the younger
generation is more indoor cookies,
[SPEAKER_01]: hype, that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Nimbin, you can get lots of outdoor
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be sort of Thai-esque.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, unfortunately, it's not like the
tie you would hope you would get where if
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, Oh, Hey, I found some tie and
you'd be like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we about to have a once in a lifetime
experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it's not that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's just like what we would call
Australian bushweeds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The acclimatized tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to get huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: The high is not as unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the yield's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's generally uplifting and it's
generally grown by guys who only ever had
[SPEAKER_01]: exposure to sativa in their life,
you know, like.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't have got indica until like,
you know, probably the mid nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like even way after California sort
of thing, when it was just super
[SPEAKER_01]: commercially available, that was when they
would have got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of those guys are just like
diehard sativa dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can definitely get that at Nimbin
these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if someone came to me and said,
how, how can I get good weed in Australia?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like, they were like, I want to come to
Australia for a holiday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I just want to make sure I got like
some good weed when I get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say it's actually very easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: To just find a good grower on Instagram
from Australia and just be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: can I buy a bag?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a fucking different world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me interject something before I
forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so one of the things I was thinking of
when, uh, when you were talking about the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the differences in, you know,
in indica, uh, in America versus there is,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, cause I bet most of our
listeners don't know like in a place like
[SPEAKER_00]: Nimbin or different places like that,
that had some weed culture, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: how intense was the police pressure,
uh, in that area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because really what I think what started
the huge wave of outdoor sativa to indica
[SPEAKER_00]: in California was helicopters before the
helicopters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as police pressure became
incredibly intense, they wanted bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: yielding, thicker, and most importantly
earlier stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that, that would have, would have
happened without that outside pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, if you're, if you're a
bush grower, as you were talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, what's it like for those people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there are some people who could
tell you they've had to battle with
[SPEAKER_01]: helicopters, but I don't think it was on
the scale of like camp and some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: notable campaigns in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, uh, largely speaking,
a lot of those outdoor growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, that if I had to go out on a limb,
I'd say their primary consideration is
[SPEAKER_01]: yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think the, the acclimatized ties
always just sort of out yielded
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, honestly, because if you're
like where Wally duck is, which is like
[SPEAKER_01]: the Northern part of Australia,
you're basically at the equator and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: will flower all year round.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was sort of hard to compare
yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got like a tie that goes for 21
weeks and it's just grow in that whole
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you'd see those crazy
photos of Kanga Tiva posting the Mullum
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never forget them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never mother sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old mother sativa is a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah, it's, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are definitely some guys outside
who, who grow, um, Indica's and I suspect
[SPEAKER_01]: that they would have had luck with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that like a lot of people,
who I speak to are interested in like sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of what Wally duck has to offer,
which is like, I've got this Z 99 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the C 99 times the anxiety of the
Zoid fuels, cause they didn't want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: rid of the sativa edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still wanted it to be like an
uplifting effect, but not so like shit
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Z 99 is sort of what you're
alluding to not so dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that shorter plant, but it's still
got that sativa high that they used to
[SPEAKER_01]: cause they grew up smoking tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was sort of the middle
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that is in fact, why they made
the Z 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was like, Hey, this is like an
indoor friendly, really uplifting sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: strain that is just a little bit more
versatile.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to modernize Australia and start
pushing Appalachia over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, to me, to me, it's like the,
the, like what C 99 kind of always pushed
[SPEAKER_03]: for an early flowering, something that had
that really nice, almost what people would
[SPEAKER_03]: typify as a sativa type high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, but fast flowering good density.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the looks, but just lacking a lot of
the paranoia, but still with the potency,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I'd love to get that over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always fascinated by, uh, things in
breeding that occur because of where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're at, not necessarily what you're
after, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so I think like for people like
Sam skunk man or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: or Rob Clark or whoever, like breeding
Colombians in, in California in the
[SPEAKER_00]: seventies, they probably would have stuck
with them, but they wouldn't finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then they're like, Oh, I'll add this
Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little faster, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, Oh, this is a little faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and then I'll add in this Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have skunk one, you know,
type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and, you know, in Australia,
like I, you know, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I can't, I can't grow a 20 week in
the Emerald triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't grow a 20, 22 week strain unless
you light depth it starting months
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just won't finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it rains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it freezes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't have the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, so without, with,
with, with tropical weather and no police
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure, like California might be a vast
sativa land still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, because you know, it,
it, it's interesting how those things
[SPEAKER_00]: shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like Australia didn't have
the same intense pressures to shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess like the one thing I could
say in relation to that point is I think
[SPEAKER_01]: another reason why the, like the old
mother sativa and those things fared so
[SPEAKER_01]: well was because for the longest time
people weren't growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were really limited by the
conditions outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're up like North, like where
Wally is dude, the humidity and the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures are off the chart year round.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that lended itself to why
they just kept growing the tie for so
[SPEAKER_01]: long, because it would never mold,
even though the humidity is like 80 plus
[SPEAKER_01]: percent all year round.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, during summer, the heat can get
pretty, I mean, this is the funny thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Historically people are like, Oh,
Australia gets hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It like the hottest it gets in California
is the same as here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, maybe we get a few more days of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's not particularly more,
but yeah, just endless weeks of heat and
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the tie lends itself to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think people from America realize
how different the climate is from say like
[SPEAKER_00]: Sydney and Adelaide and those places down
there up through Byron Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and Nimbin, and then up into
like the tropical North.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have this vast, hot,
dry desert in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's very uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get over to like,
you know, I don't even know what the
[SPEAKER_00]: weather's like in Perth or like that kind
of like isolated part of Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, it's essentially Northern
Australia is tropical, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That continent is massive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's, it's got a quite a diverse,
uh, climate between it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a guy in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an American dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name's Steve Solomon.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, um, is one of the guys who sort of
taught Coot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like, so he was like one of
Coot's gurus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, he, um, he moved to Tasmania
because the climate is the exact same as
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at Tasmania and start going
up, so like, you know, you'd say Melbourne
[SPEAKER_01]: would be sort of the next thing above
Tasmania, which is at the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_01]: continental Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhat equivalent to like Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you go up Australia, you're sort of
going down from Oregon and there is some,
[SPEAKER_01]: a degree of overlap in the climates,
not, not a hundred percent, obviously,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Oregon's like very humid and wet
sort of place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe Tasmania is a little less wet,
but it's still largely speaking,
[SPEAKER_01]: very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can try to replicate some of the
sort of micro climates, but I think
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt and Mendocino, you know,
they're their own special little egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if we have anything like that
in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the only reason I saw recently
something that really helped me with that
[SPEAKER_00]: was that it was this map of Australia that
made the weather patterns in relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: to places I knew from my, from America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you could be like, Oh,
this area is like this weather and this
[SPEAKER_00]: area is like that weather and this area
is, and I think that was like really
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful actually for me to like
understand, um, you know, the climate
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that, because I do think like
maybe down South, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: where most of the population is probably
is more like California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, um, so you're saying like in,
uh, in Tasmania, maybe does the 45th
[SPEAKER_00]: parallel go through Tasmania?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's pretty close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, it's very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know some dudes who do try to grow
similar stuff outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've got a mate who got some Jaeger
S1s off Caleb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said they did really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, okay, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the, the, the 45th parallel in
America goes through like Portland,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and, uh, but obviously it would
be the 45th North and you would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: 45th South, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, probably like,
probably for you guys, like Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia is probably like something a
little bit like Mexico, but more humid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that because I did sort of
wonder how did Nimban become this hotspot
[SPEAKER_01]: of Australia?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's, it's not geographically quite
in the right spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little too North.
[SPEAKER_01]: It rains a little too much for it to be
like real, like a lot of the guys who grow
[SPEAKER_01]: in that Nimban area, like they're always
battling, like the first rain of the
[SPEAKER_01]: season and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is really interesting that it got
set up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe the reason is that,
um, it was a, the, the police's priorities
[SPEAKER_01]: were a little less there, but,
um, yeah, I'd have to imagine that
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere down near Melbourne would
theoretically be the better spot to have
[SPEAKER_01]: your cannabis Mecca of Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's just colder.
[SPEAKER_01]: The humidity is more manageable and you
just don't have these prolonged hot
[SPEAKER_01]: periods, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I think one of the,
you know, I, uh, one of the things that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that, um, when I first read, like,
for instance, uh, this is going to sound,
[SPEAKER_00]: but DJ short's book, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which is an interesting one,
but it had some tidbits that always stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, was he talked about how in different
parts of the world, there's just,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's these cannabis regions that are
ideal for certain types of ranges of
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just so happens in America that
Humboldt, uh, and Mendocino County,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and some of Lake County and some of
Trinity are in this like sweet spot,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the temperature is nice and,
um, like it's, it's also like remote and
[SPEAKER_00]: hilly and away from authorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could kind of get away with it,
you know, and it was dry as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or at least dry and, you know,
it doesn't rain in the summertime in
[SPEAKER_00]: California very, very frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it's interesting how now that we
see legalization going on, you see all
[SPEAKER_00]: this gear being put towards growing
cannabis in all these places that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: very well suited for it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it is, you know, there's lots of
places that it's not very well suited and,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lot of times you grow where you can
get away with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the most famous cannabis
zones in the world are places that A are
[SPEAKER_00]: suitable and B you could get away with it
because you kind of have to have both,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a hugely valid point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I have to imagine that there will
be some new hotspots coming out of
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia as more time goes by.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's interesting, as you said
that you made me realize all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities, largely speaking, that I
interact with the legal ones, they are
[SPEAKER_01]: down in Victoria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess they've made the decision
that like, now it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like why, why wouldn't you set up in the
place that has the best environment for
[SPEAKER_01]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess there's some forethoughts
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is one or two operations in that far
Northern rivers, that Nimbin area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they're just having to try to
brute force their way through bad
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions with, uh, you end up spending
more money in order to grow the same kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, uh, one of the interesting things
is that when I first started going to
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam in the nineties, um,
almost all indoor technology is like
[SPEAKER_00]: trickle down technology from their
professional greenhouses that they have in
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland and in Belgium and in Germany,
because their climate sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, they grow vegetables,
like they'll have like a hundred thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: lights of cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tomatoes, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost all of our indoor technology
that we have, that we use to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, all descends from that
happening, you know, um, where Australia
[SPEAKER_00]: or America is the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both big enough that you can
probably grow various crops where the
[SPEAKER_00]: climate just suits it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, and, and, you know,
some, some places indoor is the only
[SPEAKER_00]: viable thing because the climate sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some places you can grow maybe in a
greenhouse, but you'd have to have huge
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifiers and lights and all kinds of
climate control because you're fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather isn't, isn't as ideal as you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that because that's
literally all I've been thinking about in
[SPEAKER_01]: regards to Thailand is like, it's so humid
and hot over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know if you could produce
high quality outdoor crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'd have to do it indoor and
like, yeah, I is it, I have questions
[SPEAKER_01]: about whether the logical answer for them
will just be to try to import it because
[SPEAKER_01]: like, it's just so costly to try to
overcome this just strangling humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of, part of the reason I think that,
uh, part of the reason when you see some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those like Thai sativas and they end up
being like wispy calyxes that are just
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, a tremors nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people would just want to
eliminate because of what modern cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is supposed to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's probably with that level of
humidity, that's the kind of buds you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow to not have it all rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like the effect is like, I also liked
the, um, I can't remember who said it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but someone was like, you know,
life at the equator, it's sort of a little
[SPEAKER_01]: easier cause it's warm than like up North.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's interesting how equatorial
plants tend to be more like sativa and fun
[SPEAKER_01]: and uplifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you get North or South,
you get these more Indica varieties that
[SPEAKER_01]: are sort of a bit more medicinal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe it's because life's a bit harder
in those environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been interested in like,
so what you're talking about, like the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, as well as like how that may
be affected the type of high that was
[SPEAKER_01]: selected over thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that's a huge subject too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, um, one of the reasons
is that, uh, you know, a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: sativas were bred for smoking the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where all those Indicas were bred for
harvesting the hash, the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, they were resin farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Americans and Australian others,
you know, it's, it's basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when we started getting those
Indicas that we started blending them with
[SPEAKER_00]: what we had and smoking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, there, uh, there's a,
there's a funny story, uh, that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, uh, Kamara tells about, you know,
one of Sam's stories or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, about trying to get Sam's seeds in
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wanted flour to get the seeds and
the warlord or whatever looked at him and
[SPEAKER_00]: was literally like, you know, women and
slaves smoke flour, men smoke hashish,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so, yeah, you know, like,
uh, the, they're, they, they didn't breed
[SPEAKER_00]: for smoking flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we did, you know, so it's,
it's, it's an interesting divide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parts of the world that breed for
resin and only smoke hashish and the parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the world that breed for flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very different, very different selection
pressure, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hugely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I, um, actually take this somewhere a
little unexpected?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause this thoughts need my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to ask you specifically,
not so dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts on Mendo breath?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's such a hugely popular strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think largely speaking, the
popularity comes from the Mendo perps
[SPEAKER_01]: that's utilized in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be interested to know,
like, do you look at a strain like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing it's got Mendo perps in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that if you actually look at the Mendo
flour now, there's a good few
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics that are actually,
you could say, Oh, that's actually from
[SPEAKER_01]: the Mendo perps, like the smell and the
flavor specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, um, I'd be interested to hear,
like, do you ever, do you get invested?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like sort of track it or are you
just like, it's, it's not really my thing
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, uh, you know, there's,
I'm all, I'm, I'm, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: super interested in genetics and what
passes down and what thing and what things
[SPEAKER_00]: breed for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and one of the interesting things is
because, you know, I'll be, I'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: totally honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think Mendo perps by itself is
like an elite complete strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's THC content and it's high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like people that don't smoke weed a
lot really, really, really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you smoke heavy Indica all day
long, you try to go from like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a pure Kush or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, uh, uh, Mendo mom, uh, it's lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it breeds really well and it adds
color and it adds all these unique
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say that anytime I ever smell
anything that I think, Oh, that smells
[SPEAKER_00]: like Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turns out that it has Mendo perps in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not to say, not to say that Mendo
perps has that unique and nothing else
[SPEAKER_00]: does, but there are things that are older
that had smell profiles, like people
[SPEAKER_00]: hunting for super scum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so, you know, I think, uh,
I think Mendo breath got popular because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think with IG, um, IG made everything that
was going to be popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to be photogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became very hard in the Instagram era
to have ugly weed because you couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: tell what it smelled like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you couldn't tell what it,
what it's, how it's, how it's supposed to
smell.
And so, you know, I think, uh,
I think Mendo breath got popular because I
think with IG, um, IG made everything that
was going to be popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, but you could tell what it
looked like and Mendo breath is very
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's juicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when it came out, a lot of the
popularity for it was because of the looks
[SPEAKER_03]: and a lot of the looks for OGKB at the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the staying popularity and the
reason people used it was because of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendo perps, to be honest, there was a lot
of other OGKB offerings at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was one of the later ones that,
that came out and one of the, the last
[SPEAKER_03]: ones from the original era of the OGKB
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had some of the best pictures of
it, but I think it's staying power in
[SPEAKER_03]: lines was Mendo perps because of the,
the turp content, stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that adds uniqueness to lines for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavy days.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things about that, that for
like someone who likes to know like
[SPEAKER_00]: lineage and history, um, is that a lot of
breeders like to obscure what,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they got the sauce that they got to
make what they made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people generally speaking are not
super honest about origin stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's more rare than you would like,
um, because they want to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I made this famous thing and it's all
my, my gig.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to be like, Oh,
I took a piece from here and a piece from
[SPEAKER_00]: there and a piece from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I blended together and bam,
I got lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe they don't even like the person
that the, that one of the strains came
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't want to credit that person.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and uh, you know, and so, uh,
um, but you know, good weed is good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I do think that, um, Mendo perps is
in a lot more things than people give it
[SPEAKER_00]: credit for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's a shame that phylos and others
were unable to do what they promised,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is reveal family lineages and
ancestry genetically like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it is, uh, it isn't a lot of
things, uh, and it blends well with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of things and, um, it adds color and a lot
of turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're about to crack the F1 derb,
um, whole, whole thing around that right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I'm really, I'm putting my odds on
Mendo perps being an F1 derb.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really told them that,
but I'm putting my money on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's, there's been an aspect
of, uh, people ask me sometimes on the
[SPEAKER_00]: lives to talk about the cookie story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of held off because there's
such a, there's such a juggernaut of money
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have these various intentions
about being the biggest cannabis thing in
[SPEAKER_00]: America, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So poking around at their story,
you know, like they don't really care
[SPEAKER_00]: about the truth as much as they care about
the PR of developing their brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have like a massive brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, you know, things that add to
that brand are positive things that take
[SPEAKER_00]: away or, or whatever, maybe not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cookie story is a hard one to tell
because of that factor, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, money gets involved in
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you know, who created what,
who's responsible for what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when you interview and make him break
it down for you, we'll do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to admit the reason why I was
curious about the, the Mendo purse
[SPEAKER_01]: question was because, um, it's,
it's exactly what you guys said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I like a lot of the work I'm doing now
relates to this very special jelly breath
[SPEAKER_01]: clone I found and largely specially
speaking, it's just a very Mendo breath
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've always been very interested in
asking you about that because I like
[SPEAKER_01]: through trying this jelly breath,
I'm like, man, this stuff's amazing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I can tell a lot of it's coming from
the Mendo breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can tell a lot of that's coming from
the Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's cool to hear the backstory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely think that the Mendo
breath performed the best out of the OG
[SPEAKER_01]: KBs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause a lot of people are going to put up
an argument and say, dozy does better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't think dozy does better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially considering jelly breath is a
cross of Mendo breath and dozy dough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm very grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out leaning towards the Mendo
breath side, the particular cut that I
[SPEAKER_01]: kept.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, the other stuff like
grandpa's breath from, um, dungeon bolts,
[SPEAKER_01]: like he's a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cool strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't think it's quite in that same
category as dozy dough or Mendo breath,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, it's, it's beautiful stuff,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and the, and like I've done a BX on
it and I see more of those sort of Mendo
[SPEAKER_01]: phenos coming out where I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a little less cookies looking a
little more magenta and, um, a bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: cerebral high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder how much of the train wrecks
leaking through in that from the crystal
[SPEAKER_01]: locomotive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I always wondered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to imagine that the majority of
the Mendo breath flavor you get is just
[SPEAKER_01]: from the Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it doesn't strike me to train wreck
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mendo breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that I think the train wreck gives
the structure and some of the density and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the crystal content and visible
frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think the color and the perps
and the, and the Terps and the flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles get dominated by the Mendo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's one for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the original line that was said to be
used in the Mendo breath was supposedly
[SPEAKER_03]: Keyplay said he created it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's somewhere in my seat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the original pack from Jozo of
Mendo perps, crystal locomotive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it did exist prior to Keyplay playing
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: It that did exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I have it, that means a lot of
people that knew Jojo had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it does still exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: The original mother stock does still exist
and is out there of that leaning back to
[SPEAKER_03]: the Mendo perps, crystal locomotive pre
Blackberry pie or whatever gauge called
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super cool, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you ever want to pop them or are you
just like, nah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, the last time I tried popping some of
Jojo stuff was, um, a friend of ours,
[SPEAKER_03]: working man gave me some, um, pure crystal
locomotive that he had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, yeah, I'm going to pop
these right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I like right after popping them,
it's just screwed everything up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I'm just never going to pop
these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause every time I do something screws up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're ever, if you ever want to run
through them, I know you like that line.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll send you out some of that stuff to
try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're too kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're too kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I could spend a second or two just
talking about, um, some of the stuff I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: doing, but also some of the stuff in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause something I really go for it.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like something I'm trying to do is sort of
help grow the scene and whether that be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, um, you know, tr trying to mentor
some up and coming people, just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, help avoid make the mistakes and
pitfalls I did, or just more importantly,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to help put Australia on the map a
little bit and just highlight the thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that I think is the real selling point for
Australia is that, and you could say this
[SPEAKER_01]: about many countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we don't have any USA clone on these
in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one has successfully brought them over
these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actively tell people don't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want the mites, the whole blatant
virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you don't want to be the dude who
brought that to Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I say is that the selling point is
that there's a little bit less of that
[SPEAKER_01]: same sameness about the offerings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause everyone has to hunt seeds,
find killer moms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm now at the point where I am
confident that there are a few cuttings in
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia that could stand up to some of
the cuts in the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are some cuts that,
you know, the chems, the TKs, like it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm not talking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like a lot of the stuff that's
commonly passed around as clone only is
[SPEAKER_01]: like, we've got stuff that stands up to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cool part is it's from people,
you know, like, you know, there's a,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a Bodhi cutting the chem easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's chem 91 cross to the 88 G 13
hash plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a beautiful cutting of that that
goes around Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won one of the smaller cannabis cups
one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it tends to tap a bit more into
the hash plant component.
[SPEAKER_00]: It dominates.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so, you know, what's, what's good
about that though, is that the chem 91,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've talked about this before,
but out of anything, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: my, our buddy CSI is one of the most
prolific breeders I've met.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and he said there's nothing in
his collection that passes potency as
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently as the chem 91 cut,
which came 91 was in that one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which in the body one, do you know which
one was in the chem PC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, is the 91 the real one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I remember there was two different
releases at the chem 91 G 13 hash plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I was asking, I can't
remember which one was named, which there
[SPEAKER_03]: one one had one had the Joe brand cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a diesel and one had the skunk
VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I just, so, you know,
if it adds potency and the G 13 hash plan
[SPEAKER_00]: is pretty and frosty and dense and more
modern looking, you know, in a way then,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, chem 91 is some like ancient
looking ugly Afghan weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legitimately ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I think it's beautiful,
but like, you know, it's kind of ugly
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to modern weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the way it applies its own leaves
during stuff like skunk VA can grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grows it beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no complaints about the way it's
going.
[SPEAKER_03]: He grows it beautiful, but I could never
get it to perform like he does at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just couldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Staten Island, he used to joke
about like, you know, sometimes some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the best runs that we had with it,
every fan leaf would do that and die
[SPEAKER_00]: before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bud, the bud would still be
beautiful, but it would like, you would
[SPEAKER_00]: just be like, Oh my God, for the last two
weeks of bloom, it's dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's eating itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but then it would come out fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's funny you mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think most people I know say,
Oh, if you want like a real benchmark to
[SPEAKER_01]: the chem 91, like try some from skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in his mind, he would say
those early Staten Island guy harvest were
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the benchmark for him in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's funny to me about, even though the
chems aren't, uh, they weren't named that
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were, they were grown chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, um, they really do, uh, respond well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my, my, uh, Staten used to joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, it really likes GH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really likes general
hydroponics, three part, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can try all this organic this and that
and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes out pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'd grow it in three part and
you're like, Oh my God, it's out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: park.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, what's funny about that
is he was organic for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why we all started calling it
dog was because he wouldn't call it chem
[SPEAKER_00]: because he didn't grow chem wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't grow Kenny weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew organic in dirt weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he couldn't call his organic weed chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he called it, you know, he called it
dog chem dog, you know, and that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's stuck in our little crew and
skunk VA and IC collective and me and
[SPEAKER_00]: Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, forever until the, until really
the forums, it was just dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone gave Joe Brand, according to Joe
Brand, his story is that someone gave him
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they didn't want to give him the
real shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he started passing it and didn't know
that's his, from his point of view,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's how it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds like from talking to some of
the other guys that maybe it was more
[SPEAKER_03]: intentional because Joe Brand's a little
harder to deal with for most people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no offense from my angle, but like
they, they, they had some troubles,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of that stuff, people want
history and, uh, knowing a decent amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of those people pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say that like what's a lot of what's
been publicly told is true, but then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some interplay between various
friends and falling in and out of
[SPEAKER_00]: friendships and different things that
happened at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that has been, I think
withheld, um, you know, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and people miss people,
mislabeling cuts, people going through
[SPEAKER_00]: some bad times in their life, maybe in
partying a little too hard and letting
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts get out that, you know, um,
and so it never got lost in the crew
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, but there's different individuals
at different times that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, may or may not have intentionally or
not passed out things that ended up being
[SPEAKER_00]: quote unquote fakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how we ended up with seven chem D's
is what he's trying to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, I'm not going to put that in your
mouth, but that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, you know, uh, Joe,
you know, it's, it's Joe Brand's a big
[SPEAKER_00]: partier, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was some chaos and I see
collective's life at that point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, that's where my, that's where my
not so dog even came from was,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, him selling a, uh, a bunch of dog to
Staten Island and he couldn't believe what
[SPEAKER_00]: it looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, it's not so dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so it's been, it's been lost a
few, it's been lost a few times amongst
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but no, but none of, none of the four
of us ever all lost it at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it that way, you know,
so it's been refurbished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, and honestly too,
it's like, it took, we all had it for so
[SPEAKER_00]: long before anyone even cared.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To, you know, to be, to be clear about it
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like before the forums and the
internet and all that, like it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it is back on the, on the,
the tail of like, you know, there are some
[SPEAKER_03]: people who intentionally obscure stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some people who, you know,
whatever, but there are also some people
[SPEAKER_03]: who genuinely are trying to get it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That just can't for whatever reason,
because of past stories being muddled.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just that, and that's where
it's left and you can only correct what
[SPEAKER_03]: you can at the end, you know, but there,
there are people that are genuinely,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, try to get it right and nail it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then something comes out where it's
like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's how they take responsibility for
it and how they act with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, the chem 91 thing,
a lot of us had different chem 91 cuts at
[SPEAKER_03]: the time, and none of us knew we were all
passing them to each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all thought it was the same thing,
you know, different time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you want to be historically accurate,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you also, because we come from a
clandestine society and like not everyone,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it wants to show their face or
be associated or have their real name
[SPEAKER_00]: known with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in some cases, you know,
you're protecting someone's wishes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for the larger point of their
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in another case, you might be glossing
over some things that aren't absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: critical to the history, because it might
paint them in a bad light or be personally
[SPEAKER_00]: embarrassing, or not the greatest,
you know, not the greatest time in their
[SPEAKER_00]: life when they were struggling with
something or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you don't want to just put out
gnarly details for the public to consume
[SPEAKER_00]: that might like hurt someone's feelings or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're trying to stay as accurate to
the story and as, and history as you can
[SPEAKER_00]: without it necessarily being a grimy
tell-all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about what you're,
what you're working on now, like what's
[SPEAKER_03]: brought you to now, what interests you now
genetically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to delve into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So historically I was really, and I mean,
even still now, but I'll quickly cover the
[SPEAKER_01]: backstory on it, but historically I was
working with this strain that I called
[SPEAKER_01]: raspberry mama.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's essentially a Phantom Kush F2,
which is an offering from Ken's GDP.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a cross of pink champagne to
Ken's Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ken's Kush is essentially OG cross to
sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how they got a male out of
that, but somehow they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: They managed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So crossing that OG sour thing to the pink
champagne.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from that, I bred it to the F2
and tried to just steer it a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent to the pink champagne.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause when I smelled that turp,
I was like, man, this is real interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the pink champagne?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pink champagne is an unknown clone from
the NorCal area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out largely around the time of
about cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably, probably because cherry pie came
out at the same time it stole the
[SPEAKER_01]: limelight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very similar plant in the sense
that it's a very sort of different terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like cherry pie in my mind is quite a
unique smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't too much at that time that
smelled like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got, for me, pink champagne
obviously has this sort of champagne
[SPEAKER_01]: component to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like this sweet, fizzy effervescent
quality, but there's also like this really
[SPEAKER_01]: nice feminine perfume aspect to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think to me, cherry pie is,
I would describe it similar, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's like this perfumey component.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyway, so I'm working with that and a
few people from like the Bay area remember
[SPEAKER_01]: it and they're like, Oh yeah, I remember,
you know, pink champagne.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so I'm working with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an F2 and I'm doing my thing,
making seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, I wasn't really putting out
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was still just, you know, doing my own
thing, figuring out the ropes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I eventually reversed it, made some
fems, gave those out and they did okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I had to move and I lost the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two guys who I had backing it up,
they both lost it thinking someone else
[SPEAKER_01]: had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was what then stimulated me to
move on and start looking at the jelly
[SPEAKER_01]: breath stuff I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, about a year ago, a good buddy of
mine and another breeder in Australia,
[SPEAKER_01]: his name is Feral Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He works with like land race tie and
crosses it to like elephant stomper and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that, like cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he hit me up and he was like,
bro, you probably don't remember,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you gave me a pack of the S1s you
made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hunted through them and I found
something that I think you should take a
[SPEAKER_01]: look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I went to his house and it was like
the original, the plant that I thought I
[SPEAKER_01]: had lost, but it was actually better
because the original, it would just stay
[SPEAKER_01]: green.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't budge, but this one went
purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, yes, this is like,
this is even better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've been working with that more
recently because it's come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess what's interesting is from a
genetics point of view, it's like an F2S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a bit interesting in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I recently did some feminized
crosses with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that then made the F2S2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, from a genetics point of view,
a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's, I think it's very
interesting for, especially like speeding
[SPEAKER_03]: up stabilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what was interesting was the
majority of the original S1s did not come
[SPEAKER_01]: out like the mum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, all right, the mum is a
recessive phenome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most plants aren't coming out like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when this one was the same,
I'm like, oh fuck, that means both
[SPEAKER_01]: recessives have lined up in this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can only possibly pass on the
recessive trait, which means theoretically
[SPEAKER_01]: most of the offspring should come out with
these sort of traits and not be like the
[SPEAKER_01]: S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I've definitely been interested
by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the same time, I'm also
working the JB clone into a seed line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I did was I initially made,
so I got this jelly breath clone and you
[SPEAKER_01]: just may as well think about it as a
cookies thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I crossed that to this strain I got
from Duke, which was Chem D, his Chem D.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's discussion around that,
but I'll quickly move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's Chem D crossed to the local H and the
local H is Sour Diesel crossed to Diesel
[SPEAKER_01]: slash Cuttlefish hash plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember Cuttlefish.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made S1s of it a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, actually it was a Black Russian
Cuttlefish.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like no one really worked with it,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Sub, Sunny and me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I crossed this Chem D Sour Diesel sort
of hybrid-y plant to the cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to take credit for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was clearly just something about
those two strains, which just really
[SPEAKER_01]: clicked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not taking credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two lines were just meant to cross
together because I did a 40 female
[SPEAKER_01]: phenohunt of these seeds and I found like
eight keepers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so surprised and I was like,
man, I've got to whittle these down to
[SPEAKER_01]: just like two or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the life of me, I ended up just
sort of being like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants are different and they really
do stand on their own feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's been really cool recently to be
really trying actively to disseminate
[SPEAKER_01]: those clones out into Australia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people come back to me and
say, dude, this is the first thing I grow
[SPEAKER_01]: where I feel like it's on par with
California and stuff in terms of like
[SPEAKER_01]: just, it's just the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like just the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's how it happens sometimes where
like that zipper lines up perfectly and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything just matches.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just how it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I used that strain, which I called dog
jelly and I crossed that and I used that
[SPEAKER_01]: as the initial male stock to then start
doing the back cross onto the jelly
[SPEAKER_01]: breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I then did the BX1 and that was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out very potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fixed up a number of the issues that I
had with my jelly breath clone,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was like all cookie strands.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little less yielding than you'd
like and a little more prone to mold than
[SPEAKER_01]: you might like because you know,
those little golf ball dense nugs is,
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it fixed up that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, I'm now just about
finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you can see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my little tent there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a bunch of seeded plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the little tent for seeded
pollinations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I got the BX2s being,
they're in the oven.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the plants are seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of largely what I'm doing
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's interesting because it's
a pretty stable seed line as far as like a
[SPEAKER_01]: high quality cookies sort of offering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in the past, when I had bought
cookies hybrids, admittedly, probably from
[SPEAKER_01]: some less than reputable breeders,
they were all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I could never get like a cookies
type plant until I had this jelly breath
[SPEAKER_01]: really.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of what I'm doing at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the next cycle I do, because I'm about
to head over to the States, come hang out
[SPEAKER_01]: with you all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I get back, I want to do a big
sativa hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where my partner lies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keen to do some sativa work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the strains I'm going to be
chucking in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not super sativa, but I've got a pack of
Matt Riots for play.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not many people got those.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the Fairfax four way cut by the
elite guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a special fucking clone,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I only got to see it expressed really
well once because it definitely had some
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of something.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we never saw it past any progeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those things, that was a skunky plant,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hemphill and those guys are right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a very special plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited to do that when I get back,
get some fun stuff in the ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, I think the
Australian scene is doing really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of cool breeders popping
their heads up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't want to do any misjustice,
but like some of them that jumped to mind
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, we've already mentioned
Wally Duck, who's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a bit of an older legend of the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's some new cool upcoming guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say check out like my buddy Feral,
who I mentioned earlier, who does like
[SPEAKER_01]: that land race tie versus modern stuff,
like a cool sort of clash of the worlds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another guy whose seeds I've got recently,
Stinky Jones.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's done some cool work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another guy, Bootleg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, who I'd give a shout out to is
Local Birdseed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta love that name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so they're all some cool
Australian dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're interested in just sort of
seeing what's going on in Australia,
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly recommend you check some of those
guys out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or another guy called Easties Treats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I don't want to miss anyone out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry if I do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's hard because like you don't
miss anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, no, I think it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get some names out there if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there's cool stuff going down in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, yeah, largely speaking,
you'll see me working the Raspberry and
[SPEAKER_01]: the Jelly Breath stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one cool little thing I can tell
you guys about is when my buddy Feral
[SPEAKER_01]: messaged me and said, hey, you know,
I got this S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to come see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also said, what do you think the
chances are that you had pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tent was on its own, you know,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, I found a male in the S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, okay, I've heard of this,
but like probably more likely pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination than because I think Sam
said you get like three in a thousand or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on how the genetics line up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's usually very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the back of my mind, I'm like,
it could be that, but it could probably
[SPEAKER_01]: more likely pollen contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so I've got this male Raspberry
mama.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we thought the first thing to do is
try to flower it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, let's just see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this thing, like you can't make it
flower unless you fully put it into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I put it in the tiniest pot I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made it root-bound.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it under 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried my hardest to try to stress-induce
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would not budge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only plant I have that like
basically won't even show you it's a male
[SPEAKER_01]: in veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good thing for a male.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause males usually just flower at the
first sign of root restriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, you know, you guys, there are males
that appear in, in reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to really know is like,
if you used any pollen from that male on
[SPEAKER_00]: anything and you grew up the seeds,
if it was a regular, if it was regular
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen, then you'd get anywhere from 20 to
80% male female ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's, you know, feminized,
then you'd only get female seeds or it
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't even take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even be violent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a hundred percent sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really accurate because we don't
understand the whole sexual chromosome
[SPEAKER_03]: nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the, I don't even remember the proper
term.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make myself sound stupid,
but we don't understand the whole,
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole nature of not just the sex
chromosomes, but the, what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Autosomes that, that aren't related to sex
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of those are something is having an
effect on the sex chromosomes aside from
[SPEAKER_03]: just the natural genetic sex chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not sure if that really plays out
that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what we found out most is that
when there are males in feminized stock,
[SPEAKER_03]: they tend to be males or females only
expressing male for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't, I hadn't actually thought about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so they should test female when you
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what my plan initially is I'm thinking,
well, I've done the reversal with like the
[SPEAKER_01]: proven female that we really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, why don't I just try to
make the regular versions of those fem
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses and, and if this thing is in fact,
you know, a male or a female show,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I should get some similarities
between those two seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The parents in there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I thought alternatively, I could try to
do F2S2F2.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be, yeah, it'd be interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just cross that male to keep the female
and just see what I, so yeah, it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be interesting to dive down this rabbit
hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it starts to get a bit confusing
with the, the lineage, but it should be
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sort of keen to see where it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, DJ shorts, the king of playing
with weird lineages, like crossing,
[SPEAKER_03]: making F1, like technically what would be
F1s within the same line, each gender,
[SPEAKER_03]: successive generation without ever like
breeding for this specific path or that
[SPEAKER_03]: specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's fascinating and it made some
of like my favorite stuff, regardless if
[SPEAKER_03]: it was like considered a technical or it
ended up making some really fascinating
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff that I have no end in sight of ever
stopping working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ stuff is killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's, he's definitely done more wild
stuff than any of us, which is cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what, like if people wanted to get the
Australian guy stuff, where would they go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like online, where is there a place they
can get this stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably about half of those guys I
mentioned are, are stocked at maybe like
[SPEAKER_01]: little Australian seed banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be one avenue to go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: My, my work is stocked at a seed bank in
Australia called Top Shelf Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that Feral is also stocked there
and some of those other guys might pop up
[SPEAKER_01]: on there, but I would always encourage
you, if you were interested, drop,
[SPEAKER_01]: drop the guy directly a message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia, you know, these, these guys
aren't big breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be very stoked that
you're interested in maybe learning a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit about what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that would be very receptive
to anyone who dropped them a line and
[SPEAKER_01]: said, Hey, I'm in the States and maybe I
could try some of your seed seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be receptive to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by all means, listen to the names I
mentioned and, and just type them into
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram or, or just like go to my
Instagram and look at who I follow and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll, they'll be in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, drop them a line for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as I mentioned earlier,
if nothing else, you probably have a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of a better chance of finding
something that just feels a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: different because we just don't have
access to all of those clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so things inherently have to be a
little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love, I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've, I've pretty much thought about
just dropping every single clone from here
[SPEAKER_03]: on out and only working with what I've
made out of seed from here on out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've lost a lot of that love for finding
other people's keepers or messing with
[SPEAKER_03]: other things, people, other people called
keepers and really, really just looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: what's out there and seed and just trying
to enjoy that some more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as Americans, we, it's really easy
to get trapped in the clone on the game
[SPEAKER_03]: and constantly chasing that next clone
only in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you don't have, when you,
when you have a constant access to stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that, it, it's, it's easy to fall
into it permanently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've kind of tried to push myself out
of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I, when I lost my whole collection,
I was bombed, man, that was, that was a
[SPEAKER_03]: long time of collecting and it,
and it pushed me into uncomfortable zone
[SPEAKER_03]: of having to pop seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it made me find that love and all that
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of envy a little bit some of
that out there in Australia that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that they, they still have that love for
seed and I, I'm glad I get to find that
[SPEAKER_03]: again, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it goes in phases, you know,
to what Heavy Days was talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier when people were like breeding for
what they like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, we've had a massive
explosion of American breeding going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lot of it has been profit based.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's been crossing a lot of the
same 30 to 60 cuts in innumerable ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, if you don't care,
to sell seed and you're just doing it for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and your friends, you can
literally pick any weird thing you want
[SPEAKER_00]: and go in any direction you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not limited by anything in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times people are like,
I want this drop to sell well,
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore I'm going to use things that
have name recognition and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: walk down this path that's been walked
before, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't care about that,
then the world is your oyster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of weird shit out there
that you, there's a lot of directions you
[SPEAKER_00]: can go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, you know, and sometimes, you know,
maybe you change the game, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, things aren't new and you know,
it's like, it's just like new genres of
[SPEAKER_00]: music, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not popular until it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: To some degree, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can hugely relate to everything you
just said, because if someone said to me
[SPEAKER_01]: like right now, do you think you could
base a whole breeding program off
[SPEAKER_01]: something you found in a pack of Annette
seeds, I'd say, fuck no.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was the fact that I wasn't thinking
about that, which allowed me to try
[SPEAKER_01]: something that I just thought,
oh, this is a bit weird and different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden you find
something really cool in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to encourage people to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, grow what interests you,
because you never know what will jump out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be, as you just alluded to,
the start of something which goes on to
[SPEAKER_01]: be, changes the whole scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in the worst case scenario,
if you do a bunch of breeding and it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't make any money and a lot of people
don't like it, as long as you can fall
[SPEAKER_00]: back on, I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that matters in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the experience, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so valuable to just have said,
I went through the process of selecting
[SPEAKER_01]: it, making the seeds, testing them,
and then having the foresight to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what, maybe this is a dead end,
but at least I got experience out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being able to say that this is a dead end
is a valuable tool too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a valuable tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everybody should realize that most
breeding is failure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think that's common sense to
most people though, at least in the seed
[SPEAKER_03]: making, because seed making failure,
isn't making money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of it's about making money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they're seeds, you can sell them as
long as you can market them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not as common sense as you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville used to have this joke,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That everything he did with the haze past
F1, he made it worse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was never able to make it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the NL5 hazes and the first crosses
that they made and did, those were all
[SPEAKER_00]: better than all the later stuff in his
opinion, even though he tried really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's luck in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could not find it in a ton of seeds,
or you could find it in the first 10 or 15
[SPEAKER_00]: you pop.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hugely, hugely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's interesting you say that,
because I try to encourage people to also
[SPEAKER_01]: not buy into any paradigms about having to
pop any certain number of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the more you pop, the more
you're likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I talk to people who don't pop seeds
because they're like, well, I can't pop
[SPEAKER_01]: 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just say most of my favorite,
the jelly breath I reference, I try to
[SPEAKER_01]: make this clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That jelly breath, you could say it's
biased, but I genuinely believe it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: best cutting in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will be fully upfront in saying that
I got those as three feminized freebie
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: The best shit can come from who knows
where, and it could be one or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendo perbs, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like two seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them was a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the lowest possible phenohunt you
could ever have.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one of the best blueberries I
had found in all of the years of searching
[SPEAKER_03]: for blueberry was a fricking freebie from
Dynafem blueberry hash plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like of all the odd things out there that
you think you, you know, it had some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the best blueberry smells up until,
you know, the bonnet during that run.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it can come from anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so crazy you just mentioned that
because one of the earliest strains I grew
[SPEAKER_01]: that was impressive was a Dynafem strain
we call, it was called Blue Storeberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think whatever the blue component,
like maybe the blueberry was the pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: donor part in this one as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I specifically remembered.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Blue Strawberry's World of Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it mustn't have been Blue Storeberry
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely Dynafem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe they did, maybe they made a
couple of hybrids with that blueberry hash
[SPEAKER_01]: plant pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also remembered, like looking back,
I'm like, man, how did Dynafem produce
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Spanish breeders, what I've
learned, like knowing some of them,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're fucking good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like my buddy Ernesto from Buddha Seeds,
he was one of the first doing,
[SPEAKER_03]: making a lot of seeds for greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Nirvana doing the big massive
productions for these major Dutch
[SPEAKER_03]: companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the meantime, he was also doing
auto flower breeding and moving Pakistan's
[SPEAKER_03]: Jitrali into an auto flower form into like
a reliably true breeding auto flowering
[SPEAKER_03]: magenta plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to watch him, you know,
go through this process and they have some
[SPEAKER_03]: serious good breeders over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's very easy to dismiss it
because what they sell isn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: what ends up in the packages of
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Meaning, if they're selling a Neville's
Hayes to greenhouse, it doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse is going to stock it as
Neville's Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just means that they bought it and
they're going to put it in one of the most
[SPEAKER_03]: likely one of those sativa packages that
best fits it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when people know that they make this
stuff, they might not understand that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: being misrepresented what's being made.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they have some fascinating or
fantastic breeders, fantastic breeders in
[SPEAKER_03]: the Spanish that are heavily underrated
from what they for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting how like the real heads
in the Spanish scene are not particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: well known in the USA scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think like, yeah, and some of the
clones, like, what's that, that one,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Queen Mother?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reina Madre.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like, there's a whole bunch of
clones that are just absolutely prolific
[SPEAKER_01]: over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people who are like in both USA,
they're like, oh, yeah, that's a good
[SPEAKER_01]: clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just like the Spanish think it's
good, but it's not.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's another one called
Lily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not familiar with that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's from that same crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: It uses that XAML slash Queen Mother
stuff.
Anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really interesting stuff for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be keen to get in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more I hear about the Mano Negroes
work, the more I'm like, damn,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we had more clear info about his
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most people I know that know La Mano
real well.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a, he was an excellent breeder,
but he did inject a lot of Dutch shit into
[SPEAKER_03]: his stuff and left that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why it's so pretty because it
is very Dutchified.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he did not keep that very clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a good storyteller and he made some
amazing stuff, but for a preservationist,
[SPEAKER_03]: you wouldn't, I think a lot of the people
that were around him that liked him a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: were more saddened to find out that it was
very injected with Dutch stuff and left
[SPEAKER_03]: out for someone who was such a serious
preservationist.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he did make some amazing stuff for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it goes to your previous point in
which you were sort of happy that clones
[SPEAKER_00]: from America weren't making their way to
Australia because you were avoiding the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole viroid and, you know, super mites
and all the various things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: struggle with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to the Spain point, you know,
international borders and customs and
[SPEAKER_00]: oceans are a real barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spain has murdered, like Spain,
Amsterdam, all of them have been murdered
[SPEAKER_03]: by the HLV now.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of them, they've been taken out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no good barrier there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I've been hearing about lately
is the Spanish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually meant more in the sense of
like, you know, in America, like we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get very, it's not like you get Spanish
strings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like you're getting, you know,
like things that he was just talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be very famous in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And amazing cuts, you know, it took,
you know, there's a couple of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's, not Neville's Hayes,
but like a couple of Neville's F1s that
[SPEAKER_00]: have made their way to America now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it took like 30 years and most of them
aren't over here, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Australia, Spain, Europe,
America, even Canada, which like America
[SPEAKER_00]: and Canada share a border.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that border and, you know,
is a real barrier to free exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of genetics and there's really good things
in Canada that don't really exist in
[SPEAKER_00]: America and vice versa because of that
barrier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not so sure they don't make it over
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not so sure that it's that they don't
pick up because they're not popular
[SPEAKER_03]: strains because we've had a lot of the
Dutch stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the Quays was over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had it, but I was too stupid to keep it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like stuff makes it over,
but because it's not popular, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily spread to a lot of those
Spanish strains have weird names like the
[SPEAKER_03]: critical Bilbo, like over here,
that would sound like critical Bilbo,
[SPEAKER_03]: like no one's going to grow critical Bilbo
over here.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, some of it is a naming
convention for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it is, it is kind of crazy that
there isn't more exchange between the
[SPEAKER_03]: countries, even with tissue culture being
more prevalent and stuff that we're not
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing more of an exchange.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what that is other than
naming conventions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That segue is nicely into like something I
wanted to ask you guys, which is that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's, I mean, not, not just now,
but in recent years, there's been quite a
[SPEAKER_01]: vocal discussion around the nomenclature
of cannabis and like how we really need to
[SPEAKER_01]: get with the times.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a part of me that thinks that
may never actually change because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just so widely disseminated the current
language.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to hear your guys' thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do you think we'll ever have a
global reset or do you think it'll just
[SPEAKER_01]: continue on and the squeaky wheel will
keep letting us know we're doing it wrong
[SPEAKER_01]: and that sort of vibe?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I do think that, you know,
like for instance, like how in cannabis we
[SPEAKER_00]: use BX and it's not ever used outside of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always BC, back cross, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know, even though it might
like scientists and stuff might look at it
[SPEAKER_00]: and laugh at us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still using that word BX to convey
the right information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people understand what the word
means, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of that is, you know,
I mean, I guess like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they miss named and, you know,
Indica should be Afganica and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Sativa should be Indica because
it comes from India and Sativa should
[SPEAKER_00]: really be, you know, Ruderala should
really, you know, all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that'll ever catch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think it's, I think Sativa Indica is
too ingrained in our subculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that'll shift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even people that are anal about it like me
still use Indica Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, you know, and then there's
also this thing where you look at some,
[SPEAKER_00]: you look at some stupid seed seed bank or
whatever, and it's like, oh, this is 72%
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica and 18% Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, all that's made up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no idea, you know, like
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like it is, it is misleading in a
sense, because like, I definitely think
[SPEAKER_00]: percentages, they mostly just pull out of
their ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hugely, hugely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely have noticed a lot of
breeders, you know, all these days just
[SPEAKER_01]: list everything as 60, 40 Indica dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a way man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, the confusion, the confusion
around phenotype versus genotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some of that kind of kind of
stuff is, you know, that probably should
[SPEAKER_00]: change over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we pretty well established that we
got it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the last episode I did with the PhD
lady.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I want to know, am I using this word
correctly?
[SPEAKER_03]: because I'm not a scientist, I'm not a
botanist by trade, you know, like
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotype, like as I learned it,
genotype are the genes behind the
[SPEAKER_03]: expressible traits, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: What you're visually seeing are the
phenotype, the visual traits that are
[SPEAKER_03]: expressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the phenotype, the genotype are
the genes behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not, you know, so I think we're
using it correctly, according to her
[SPEAKER_03]: anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so, because I hate being wrong,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess my general point is that
like we, but you know, that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis does, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we take, we take these like real
world terms and then we like create our
[SPEAKER_00]: own use with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like what made, you know,
legalization so hard in some ways is like
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado, when it first went legal,
they went in and took all these suggestive
[SPEAKER_00]: children names and candy names and
trademark names off the cookies as
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies, because the Girl Scouts sued
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, and so we had all this
counterculture tongue in cheek,
[SPEAKER_00]: funny names that played off things that
people knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't see any reason why that's not
going to continue to some degree in
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're, we're a pretty subversive
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our opinion is you should bend towards
us.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it like, I totally agree with
what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it speaks to the point of that
the purpose of language is not necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a hundred percent technically
correct, but to facilitate an exchange of
[SPEAKER_01]: ideas where we both know we're talking
about the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you're alluding to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like we say sativa because we both
know that we are thinking of the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing when we say sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's almost in a sense,
the manifestation of language evolving in
[SPEAKER_01]: front of your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, maybe it's not technically
correct, but we know what we're saying to
[SPEAKER_01]: each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's almost more important to
facilitate ideas being exchanged.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I almost wondered with the
continuation of the sativa indica thing
[SPEAKER_03]: though, if it really takes away from the
effect of the high, because I think that's
[SPEAKER_03]: where it genuinely confuses people when
they go into collectives and they say,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like a sativa because I know,
because this, the, on Jim Belushi's show,
[SPEAKER_03]: it told me that sativas give me energy and
I need to go work in the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where you run into the problems
because just because maybe it is a narrow
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf type plant doesn't necessarily mean
it's going to have a specific type high.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe, maybe that's where the education
needs to be, not in a whole new
[SPEAKER_03]: terminology, but in explaining high types
and that these sativa indica traits don't
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily mean high type.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't necessarily know if that is going
to be it, because I think now that
[SPEAKER_00]: consumerism and legality is involved,
what you see like in food and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that is people will use like the word
natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if things don't have a specific legal
meaning, but they convey an idea or an
[SPEAKER_00]: image, then marketers are going to use
them to their advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't say, for instance,
in America, this is a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_00]: organic unless it's actually a hundred
percent organic because there's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: federal rule and you have to, but you can
say it's all natural.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's the naming thing
that's going to go on unless there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: rule against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to call shit,
whatever they think makes them money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's capitalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to push.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have, they're going to
want to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's why, like to some degree,
it's why almost all these strains are
[SPEAKER_00]: candy and dessert names now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody would name a strain in 2022,
the dog shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would name it, you know, candy,
apple, something, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or strawberry or strawberry switch,
you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would, they would evoke some image.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't be cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't be dog shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't be, you know, so you know,
it Indicant Sativa, that's as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: these, as long as these perceptions
persist about what the effect is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these companies, they would name,
you know, they would name weed strains
[SPEAKER_00]: emotion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like relaxation, calm,
you know, I think you just gave everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: more ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, that's, that's, that's what
happens, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's what it's, there's,
there's a capitalism part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, us weed nerds can argue about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then burner is going to be
out there being like, you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke some relaxation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, it's, it's what sells.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I actually make a really random
comment?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you guys will be interested in
talking about it, but I wanted to push
[SPEAKER_01]: myself to express at least one personal
opinion that I've never expressed before,
[SPEAKER_01]: as I was thinking about a whole diplomatic
thing before the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, yeah, I shouldn't be
diplomat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should say something anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, it ties into what you were just
saying, like about like what we can say
[SPEAKER_01]: and what we can't say and sort of industry
versus standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically in Australia, like I,
I work in like generally speaking,
[SPEAKER_01]: the healthcare profession.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used to work in pharmacy and I
experienced it there and I experienced it
[SPEAKER_01]: now where I currently work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I would really love to do is
encourage people to be what I would call
[SPEAKER_01]: academically honest about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's effect on people because I speak
to a lot of people in the healthcare
[SPEAKER_01]: industry who are not particularly
interested in hearing about the benefits
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis because for a long time
they've heard people quote incorrect
[SPEAKER_01]: things like mantra.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like the real specific one that I sort
of have a bit of a pet peeve with is that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis doesn't kill people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the thing that I would say is first
of all, I have a family member who has
[SPEAKER_01]: bipolar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he has cannabis, he goes manic
and becomes very unwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think we need to be honest with
ourselves and acknowledge that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: actually maybe isn't for everyone and that
that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that the people I speak
to, they take issue that they're told,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's better than anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't kill anyone, blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's stronger arguments we
could use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not dishonest to say cannabis causes
less damage, but it helps health-wise and
[SPEAKER_01]: societally than any other drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very strong argument and it's a
hundred percent correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, my buddy is a doctor and he has
literally seen people die from getting
[SPEAKER_01]: high and walking in front of a car
accidentally and getting hit by a car.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's seen people who present who have only
smoked green their whole life and they
[SPEAKER_01]: have emphysema.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to be honest with
yourselves that like there are trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think it's the best choice by far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm sitting here, heavy smoker
myself, but I just think that we just need
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a little more mindful about whether
we're like a bit, whether the claims we're
[SPEAKER_01]: making are a hundred percent genuine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said, I think there are really
strong arguments to make that are true
[SPEAKER_01]: saying it's, you know, it's less hard,
clearly, but I think that we just need to
[SPEAKER_01]: get out of this space of like,
it causes zero harm because the reality is
[SPEAKER_01]: any smoke in your lungs long-term will
cause damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people think,
well, it's better than tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say a hundred percent,
150% better than tobacco, but that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The conversation is that a lot of people
say cannabis has zero negative effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think, yeah, it would be cool
if we could all be a little more honest
[SPEAKER_01]: with ourselves about like, it's not
perfect, but it's far better than the
[SPEAKER_01]: other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: No question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's my little edgy point that I
wanted to get out there because I do
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately see the negative impact of
those statements that you get these old
[SPEAKER_01]: school, you know, doctors who are like,
well, I don't really listen to what the
[SPEAKER_01]: community says because they say it doesn't
cause harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can tell you clearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I did want to get that out there
that we can still do a great job
[SPEAKER_01]: advocating for cannabis and promoting how
it's better than some of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: alternative recreational sources of
relaxation.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I just think we have to be a
little more honest and recognize that it
[SPEAKER_01]: does have some health effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily for everyone,
but it is far better than alcohol or
[SPEAKER_01]: tobacco or any of the harder ones,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think being mindful of the
language we use will probably help that
[SPEAKER_01]: longer term to get some of the more
professional white collared people to
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the reality is we know for a fact
that the underground community was ahead
[SPEAKER_01]: of the medical community.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way CBD has helped people clearly
shows that the medical community was
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like no benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like for epilepsy, clear proof,
undeniable, it's beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we want to try to maintain that
moral high ground and not seed it by
[SPEAKER_01]: making these sort of ambiguously incorrect
statements and say, look, there's value.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got we've got proof of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, there are pros and cons
like anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's probably a reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least in America, but probably
elsewhere, too, to where it was so
[SPEAKER_00]: demonized by society and the government
that you felt that like talking about it
[SPEAKER_00]: in a nuanced way, any anything you
admitted would be used as a club to beat
[SPEAKER_00]: you over keeping it right where they
wanted it to be, which was totally illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: and as dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in America, it's schedule one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's right up there with, you know,
you know, the worst drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: methamphetamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even it's worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worse than coke.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use cocaine in in no surgeries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cocaine is actually schedule two in
America because it has legitimate medical
[SPEAKER_00]: uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not that I'm advocating for that,
but by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, you know, there's an aspect
there where it hasn't really been properly
[SPEAKER_00]: studied for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when they did study it,
they were looking for harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think we're kind of in the
infancy of balancing out cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing you didn't mention, you know,
I actually don't think that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Canada, I don't think cannabis
has ever killed anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I do think that you're probably
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has has made people do stupid
things and they died while high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have one of my really close friends
has cannabis hypermesis syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where he gets the vomiting and he's had to
quit cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but it does exist and everyone
thinks it's neem or this or that or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he grows his own and he had to give it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's kind of like shellfish
is amazing for most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some people die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peanut butter is amazing for most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some people know not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people have allergies.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have different physical makeups and
different genes that react to certain
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's mostly beneficial,
but there's it's rare in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That everything is a perfect good or a
perfect bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, anything carcinogenic is going to
kill someone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you smoke it, it's going to
kill you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily it being cannabis being
the thing killing you, but the
[SPEAKER_03]: carcinogenic factor from smoking cannabis
is probably what's really had a major.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pepper is supposed to be slightly
carcinogenic, but I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I'm not sure it's this
carcinogenic is burning up a flower or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one thing I'll say about that is
that I don't know about the carcinogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect of weed simply because we know that
tens of millions of Americans have smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: it every day and plenty of other
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in America, we lose like half a
million people a year to tobacco illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they haven't been able to pin cancer
on cannabis despite trying extremely hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that one is still up for
debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of tar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of carcinogens in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you would think that if tens of
millions of Americans have smoked it daily
[SPEAKER_00]: for years, that you would have a lot of
them would get sick and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't seen that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it remains to be seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it necessarily proven correlation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it mean that hasn't been seen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I also think I'll throw this
out there to go on to heavy days is point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that smoking flour itself out of
the traditional ways and bongs or bowls or
[SPEAKER_00]: joints or whatever has been well studied
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's generally pretty
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if all of the modern dab and
extracts and all these other goose that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are smoking all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if those are going to end up
being as safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, people are
saying, oh, it's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also haven't had years and years
and years of people using it yet to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what the effects might be later on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a great example of three
different eras right here of the modern
[SPEAKER_03]: era, the mid era and the old era of
different pushbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: To use a perfect example, I remember when
all my I'm not bad in the hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I remember when a lot of my friends
would smoke their dabs out of glowing
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry bangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now know if you're smoking hash at
eight hundred and nine hundred degrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's creating cyanide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's creating various carcinogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one does that anymore because that
shit is fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet we also want to fuck you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everyone I knew back then was like
heating a torch until that thing was
[SPEAKER_00]: glowing red and then dropping goo in it
and taking big hits and coughing until
[SPEAKER_00]: they couldn't breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably not the best.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I'm so I'm so stoked you guys
brought those points up because I think I
[SPEAKER_01]: could probably add a few little tidbits of
info.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of when you're smoking green
plant matter, like there's no tobacco in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've actually shown that across the
board, most plant matter, when you combust
[SPEAKER_01]: it, it turns into this molecule called
4,4-bipyridine, which is basically a
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively benign molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why cannabis doesn't appear to
increase your rate of cancer per se,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the molecules it turns into is
pretty benign.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's interesting is when you smoke
cannabis, as you mentioned, it produces
[SPEAKER_01]: more tar than the equivalent volume of
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one gram of cannabis actually
makes more tar.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference is, is that when you smoke
cannabis in your throat, you have this
[SPEAKER_01]: thing called the mucociliary elevator.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically like the little hairs that
brush the dust up out of your lungs and
[SPEAKER_01]: stops your lungs from getting filled with
gunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens is when you smoke
cannabis, those hairs, they become
[SPEAKER_01]: paralyzed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after a few hours, they start back up
and you can clear that tar out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not actually a big deal,
even though people do like to point out
[SPEAKER_01]: that cannabis produces more tar,
your body can get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sweeps it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't recognize it goes down your
esophagus and you just swallow it and it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes out the other end.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's interesting though is with tobacco,
it actually kills those hairs and the
[SPEAKER_01]: hairs take at least two weeks to grow
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a result, unless you abstain from
smoking tobacco for two weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: that tar will accumulate in your lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though it's less than cannabis,
your body can't get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an interesting sort of thing to
keep in your stash because people love to
[SPEAKER_01]: shit on cannabis and say it's more tar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, yeah, but sort of not
actually an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly, when we look at the
carcinogen aspect of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no proven carcinogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's not going to give you lung
cancer per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what is interesting is that when you
inhale any smoke, it essentially causes
[SPEAKER_01]: the breakdown of the alveoli, which
long-term is what we would call emphysema.
[SPEAKER_01]: And emphysema long-term will turn into
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
[SPEAKER_01]: COPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way I try to explain it to people
is you might think of being exposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: asbestos and you could say, well,
it's not actually the asbestos that kills
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Asbestos causes mesothelioma and then it's
the mesothelioma that kills you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I actually view it the same way
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis doesn't kill you, but it causes
COPD and COPD will kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's just about like sort of
keeping it in perspective sort of,
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of people, yeah,
it's hard to understand that it can kill
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I myself used to say, well,
I've never met anyone who smoked pure
[SPEAKER_01]: green their whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's sort of hard to know because most
people have smoked a decent amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like, it's just muddled and
it's like, well, how do you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have bumped into a few British guys
who reckon they've just smoked green their
[SPEAKER_01]: whole life and they do have emphysema.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, I guess on this point,
I have cut my usage back so that I tend to
[SPEAKER_01]: just consume in the evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this has actually been really
beneficial for just my own personal
[SPEAKER_01]: health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this is a very specific thing to me,
but I feel like not having brekkie bongs,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak, for me personally has been
quite beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like my respiratory capacity
essentially has been better for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would just encourage people to just
be mindful of this in the long term,
[SPEAKER_01]: because unfortunately COPD is a bit of a
rough one and it'd be better to avoid it
[SPEAKER_01]: if possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the 4,4-bipyridine thing,
I'd encourage people to look into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty benign.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, overall, clearly smoking weed is
way better than tobacco, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's just no question about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the nicotine or tobacco that's
causing the stuff in your lungs to freeze?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know yet, probably, because vapes
are so young, nicotine and tobacco are
[SPEAKER_00]: always mixed in the same thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I saw this big study and I can't
say what it is right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did see this thing where it was like
they studied a huge amount of nonsmokers,
[SPEAKER_00]: weed smokers only, weed and tobacco and
just tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the highest rate of lung cancer was
tobacco, followed by weed and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then strangely, the control group,
the normal lung cancer was third.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that had the least amount
of lung cancer were the people that smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis only.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as Heavy Day says, just because it
protects you from one thing doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't increase your risk for
something else to come along and harm you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of times we oversimplify
things by being like, see, it prevents
[SPEAKER_00]: this, so it's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or see, it causes this, so it's all bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen that with CBD in the USA.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a literal snake oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: The show here with CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally, it is being sold in every gas
station now, at least in my area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every gas station carries some sort of CBD
contraption or CBD flower, even.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sell everywhere, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's being sold.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you talk to my chicks' parents or
whoever, they really have this idea that
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD cures everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every last thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this weird thing that we won't
know for probably decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since you're in the medical
profession, maybe people are going to push
[SPEAKER_00]: it along.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these guys in Israel, we legitimately
have a cannabinoid system in our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBD and THC interacts with that
cannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty unstudied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't exactly know what it affects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the body's systems that I
think is the most poorly understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they only discovered it in the
late 80s, early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't know how cannabis and CBD
interacts with your cannabinoid system or
[SPEAKER_00]: even what your cannabinoid system totally
does in relationship to the rest of your
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think people forget that we know a
lot, but that we only figured out what
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria was like 130 years ago or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still have a vast amount of things
to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to be surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was a kid, heavy days, they told
everyone that margarine was clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: superior to butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they have a much different opinion of
trans fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things change.
[SPEAKER_00]: New evidence comes in and it changes
people's perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know where it's going to lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think it's being studied now more
than at any time in our history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would imagine over the next 20 or 30
years will probably be a golden era of
[SPEAKER_00]: discovering how cannabis interacts with
human beings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, hugely, hugely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am 100% on the fence and almost
anticipating the worst with these
[SPEAKER_01]: long-term vape studies coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: We totally do not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I switched from bongs to vapes a bit over
two years ago, thinking I was doing it for
[SPEAKER_01]: my health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as time goes by, I'm like,
man, am I about to get cancer?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they find out, oh, it turns out vaping
is way worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something really concerning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just to add one little extra little
study tidbit in there, they did a
[SPEAKER_01]: different study where they tried to assess
the lung function of just pure cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: smokers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they basically found was if you
look at lung function, we tend to use
[SPEAKER_01]: these two measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: One's called FEV1, which stands for how
quickly can you push all the air out of
[SPEAKER_01]: your lungs?
[SPEAKER_01]: So forced expiratory volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we tend to look at it over one second.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how much can you push out in one
second?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other one is how much can you
hold in total, which is your forced vital
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically what they found was is that the
people who had older and had smoked
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis their whole lives, they had
slightly smaller overall capacity,
[SPEAKER_01]: which meant there was some degree of
emphysema there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they actually had a better FEV1,
which is the more one you're interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what they basically found was a
lifetime of ripping bongs actually
[SPEAKER_01]: strengthens your lungs.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they found that a lifetime of ripping
cones gave you the same benefits as
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who was a diver their whole life,
who worked at holding their breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's real benefits associated with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they basically were like, yeah,
a little bit less total volume,
[SPEAKER_01]: but your use of the space is superior to
someone who hasn't smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be my favorite part of the
whole interview, that I've been training
[SPEAKER_00]: my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just dedicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke bongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my primary delivery system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one I find the most convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should see the shapes of his bongs are
very phallic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be phallic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be a tube with a base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ergonomically fits in the mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, ergonomically just slides right in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see it when it comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to know, Heavy Days, that once
every episode, Matt tries to get me to
[SPEAKER_00]: break by throwing out usually some kind of
phallic reference and tries to get me to
[SPEAKER_00]: crack and throw me off my train of
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was running out of time and he
probably realized he needed to get it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to be cognizant of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hoping we could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always remembered when I interviewed
Bodhi, he did something very different and
[SPEAKER_01]: he was like, I would love to give people
some book recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any chance I might be able to do
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've always thought if I could
recommend a few books to people,
[SPEAKER_01]: like not necessarily cannabis specific,
but just things that are good reads.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think one of the most influential
books in my life is definitely one called
[SPEAKER_01]: The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der
Kolk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a book largely speaking about people
who have trauma and how you can help them
[SPEAKER_01]: overcome that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's very interesting
because it speaks about how a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: psychological problems manifest
physically.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear people talking about tents in the
shoulders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyway, it was a seminal literature
when it came out, The Body Keeps the
[SPEAKER_01]: Score, Bessel van der Kolk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likewise, The 48 Laws of Power and The
50th Law by Robert Greene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.
[SPEAKER_01]: An absolute staple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please consider that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've recently really gotten into Ram Dass
and I like walking each other home and
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming nobody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and Bodhi have had some really nice
chats about those books.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you would vibe those if you
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oliver Sacks, The Man Whom I Stook His
Wife for a Hat and Awakenings are two very
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting books if you like neurology
and how things can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to remember what that was.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then The Extreme Ownership and The
Dichotomy of Leadership by Jocko Willink
[SPEAKER_01]: are both very good books if you like that
sort of accountability style of things,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I'm pretty into myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, my two final ones,
Not Gonna Hurt Me by David Goggins is
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly my favorite book ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But likewise, if you want to learn a
little bit about Australian history,
[SPEAKER_01]: I strongly recommend you to check out a
book called Dark Emu by Bruce Pascoe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt anyone listening has heard of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a book that, largely speaking,
when people came and colonized Australia,
[SPEAKER_01]: they very much whitewashed the Aboriginal
history and said that they were a very
[SPEAKER_01]: primitive people and violent and blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this book really outlines how in many
aspects of their society, they were far
[SPEAKER_01]: more advanced than us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'd highly recommend check out Dark
Emu by Bruce Pascoe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing how that happened to the
Native American culture here, over there,
[SPEAKER_03]: just to any native culture that were
terrorized by Europeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally think as far as humans go,
to be fair, any group that comes in that's
[SPEAKER_00]: more technologically advanced,
especially with weapons, that tends to be
[SPEAKER_00]: bad for the local population.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mongols weren't European, but you sure
probably didn't want them showing up to
[SPEAKER_00]: your city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Europeans, we get a rap because we
colonized everywhere, and it's a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: recent and it's very well documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's certainly, it's a human failing,
unfortunately, where lots of cultures,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the first thing they used to do
when they took over a culture was burn the
[SPEAKER_00]: libraries and burn the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's aspects to that that suck,
but it's part of the human experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to throw out some book
recommendations, I'm going to throw out
[SPEAKER_00]: some book recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start with some, I don't know,
they're not weed based necessarily,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they maybe inform your experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is called The Natural Mind,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a book by Andrew Weil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of a study on why people
like to change their head space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why people like altered states of
consciousness, how normal it is for people
[SPEAKER_00]: to want to alter their consciousness and
how many different creative things come
[SPEAKER_00]: out of them putting yourself in a
different perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just, I'll move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the coolest things he says,
usually the first time that people get
[SPEAKER_00]: high is he's like little kids spinning
around in circles until they get so dizzy,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't stand up and they fall over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's usually the first change in
consciousness that people actually
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost universal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So he got really famous for like writing a
bunch of self-help books and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that book came out in the seventies
when he was still a researcher,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it's really interesting take
on why our mind likes having a change in
[SPEAKER_00]: consciousness, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two would be another book by Andrew Weil
called From Chocolate to Morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a book, it's probably a little
dated now, but it is basically every drug
[SPEAKER_00]: that affects humans and the most
up-to-date knowledge, good and bad on what
[SPEAKER_00]: it does to you without all the
governmental politics, just like he's a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Harvard trained physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he just looked at it like, well,
what does the medical say about caffeine
[SPEAKER_00]: or chocolate or heroin or marijuana or,
you know, whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if people want to read about what
things do to you without a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit, like we were discussing with
weed, it's, you know, it's a little older
[SPEAKER_00]: now, but it's probably a pretty good
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting onto the metaphysics side of
things, like he was mentioning with Ram
[SPEAKER_00]: Dass, there's a book by the Dalai Lama
that really affected me that I read when I
[SPEAKER_00]: was locked up, which was The Art of
Happiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think many people think about
happiness and what happiness means in
[SPEAKER_00]: their own lives, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what feeling good means.
[SPEAKER_00]: People chase all these things that their
parents want or their society wants or
[SPEAKER_00]: what they think they want, and they don't
think about like what kind of life or what
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of mental state leads to calmness and
peace and happiness and enjoying life,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so since we all only know that we get
this one shot, maybe, maybe not,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe, you know, we might as well enjoy it
while we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mind is a funny thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So books that help you explore your mind
and explore why your mind does what it
[SPEAKER_00]: does is pretty cool, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, speaking to the
Aborigine side of things, there's a book
[SPEAKER_00]: by Howard Zinn that's kind of
controversial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called A People's History of the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was basically written about all the
people, you know, mostly we write about
[SPEAKER_00]: like powerful white people that had all
these big effects on the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sort of take it from like a
native's perspective or a woman's
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective or a black person's
perspective or an immigrant's perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: like what was America like for them,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just, you know, any book that gets
you out of your comfort zone a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: or teaches you something about the world,
books are how we pass knowledge down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's super cool that you brought up
some of your favorites and I'll shut up
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to download those to The Art of
Happiness and The People's History of the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get the audio book going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to go for a bike ride.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm going to get the trauma one that
you mentioned too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a pretty interesting book.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of knowledge out there and
it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually ran this thing about 50
minutes longer than we almost ever do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that, you are probably our longest
chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, which is pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a blessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I able to give a quick shout out or
two?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, please do.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And where to get your seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nail it all out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess just off the top of my head,
I would say like, you know, shout out to
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone who's ever been on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, everyone who's been on the
show has helped steer me in some form or
[SPEAKER_01]: another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, whether the steering was
positive or negative, I've hopefully come
[SPEAKER_01]: out a bit better the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a huge shout out to everyone in the
Australian scene who's trying hard to help
[SPEAKER_01]: promote it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that things are still very
fledgling and it's easy to look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: states and to feel like we're so far
behind, but I genuinely believe there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people in Australia who are both
passionate and are really putting their
[SPEAKER_01]: mind to it to try to progress things
along.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And furthermore, you know, like a shout
out to all the people who, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we stand on the shoulder of giants,
you know, to anyone who's ever given me
[SPEAKER_01]: any work that I've used for everyone who's
just been a part of the scene before me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly couldn't be here without all
of the knowledge from those who've walked
[SPEAKER_01]: the path before us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I try to always be very grateful
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my final little thing would be if
you're interested in my seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can check out Seeds here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a UK distributor, Simply
Souvenirs, who's about to have a drop
[SPEAKER_01]: soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're in Australia, just drop me a
message or check out Top Shelf Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, super grateful to have been
invited on the show, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an honor to be with my contemporaries
like yourself, who I view with such high
[SPEAKER_01]: regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're happy to have you, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, our audiences are pretty similar,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's people that are seeking some
kind of path to history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no reason that we shouldn't be
working together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm glad we finally spoke and hashed
our way through shit, because that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: only way people grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate you for reaching out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you did that big me a culpable,
but it wasn't necessary because it was
[SPEAKER_03]: just as much me as it was you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I genuinely feel that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for coming and being the
bigger man and actually emailing me and
[SPEAKER_03]: reaching out like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I had to make things right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very grateful that you're willing
to be open to my apology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, we're going to hang soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be in the States in December,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, drop me a message.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be in an area near you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we appreciate it very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate anyone's listening time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who likes to nerd out on history
and culture related to weed, we try to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it interesting and we try to cover
different topics at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, thank you all for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got not so back.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about that, guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers.
Cheers.
