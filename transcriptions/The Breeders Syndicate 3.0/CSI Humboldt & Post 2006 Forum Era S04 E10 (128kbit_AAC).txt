[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_00]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-So-Dot, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_05]: I exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look like you're not dead yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm definitely not dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm definitely not dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in need of a haircut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sexy shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, what's up with the third party?
[SPEAKER_00]: Waiting for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Waiting for them for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just talked to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just telling everyone we're going
to be going over the forum era,
[SPEAKER_00]: post-overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overgrow, so 2006, roughly, and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was explaining how there are a lot
of forums still up that were around during
[SPEAKER_00]: that time, like The Farm, ICMAG,
Troll It Up, some of the others that came
[SPEAKER_00]: around that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a lot that are not up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people that like to pretend that they
were around back then often reference ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that are still up that they can go back
and reread and pretend like, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're missing like 90% of the
conversations that were going on because
[SPEAKER_00]: those aren't even accessible any longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things I notice about that era
is that a lot of times we catch people on
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff because people go back to bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they read threads and things like that
to pick up years and tidbits and
[SPEAKER_05]: information that make their stories sound
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they weren't there to know who was who
or who to take seriously or what was
[SPEAKER_05]: misinformation even then.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so a lot of times it's a tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a big tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to someone that never read any of
those forums, you can come out and
[SPEAKER_05]: confidently start jabbing about a bunch of
stuff and sound like you were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say anybody's name,
but someone made a post the other day that
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously was not around on the forums and
said, you know, X person got cloned from Y
[SPEAKER_00]: person, got cloned from Z person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just super off, like the most
off it could be.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's learning for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: We try not to name names when it's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: The chain of custody that was asserted.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you just had to laugh.
[SPEAKER_05]: At a certain point.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will say even back then,
like, you know, I don't know exactly how
[SPEAKER_05]: to describe it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would say that, like, like Overgrow
even had some of the best commentary,
[SPEAKER_05]: but also some of the worst.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you kind of the forums really helped
figuring out what you were doing if you
[SPEAKER_05]: already went in there with some connection
and some ability to discern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, cannabis world was a little bit
more like where the adults gathered.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Overgrow, you could have like everyone
from like some 17 year old kid shitposting
[SPEAKER_05]: you, even though we didn't use that term
back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: To like Kamara and Sam Skunkman and PhDs
and breeding talking shit in another in
[SPEAKER_05]: another area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really was like a cross section of
weed in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main, my main thing would be like,
I would compare that to like grass city
[SPEAKER_00]: from my era, grass city and roll it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always call it a troll it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those two were like what everybody
would say, like that's where everybody,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody had an account on those pretty
much because that's where everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: started at during that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then slowly you'd see people migrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then those, the ones that hung out in
that area kind of never really seemed to
[SPEAKER_00]: go anywhere as far as their knowledge or
making any headway with anything really.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I saw it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and you know, it should be said
too, that like, you know, there was
[SPEAKER_05]: different, different forums had different,
I don't know, different ethics maybe is
[SPEAKER_05]: the best way to put it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, some, some were more lightly
moderated and things got left up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, obviously like hate speech and
various other aspects was, was eliminated,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, or, but a lot of times,
you know, unlike IG or whatever,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, if you didn't like the threads
got left, they might get locked if
[SPEAKER_05]: arguments got too heated, but they would
typically be left.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where in today's environment on IG,
a lot of times people just get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all, it's all, uh, what do you call
that curated?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all curated.
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as it starts going off the rails
or as soon as they start seeing
[SPEAKER_05]: information, they don't want out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they'll just delete comments or
they'll delete the whole thread or they'll
[SPEAKER_05]: turn off comments right away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, and then, you know,
I see mag, you know, there was,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, there was an in crowd and out
crowd.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the out crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I think I had a record, um,
for being the person most banned from
[SPEAKER_00]: every forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, it, I think that, I mean,
I even had my own forums back in the day
[SPEAKER_00]: that people rocked on, you know,
it got bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was interesting in the sense
that like in the beginning in overgrown
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis world and stuff, I was super
excited and I got on there to share
[SPEAKER_05]: information with a, with a bunch of
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then, you know, but I was always
nervous about doing any kind, like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I lived in Mendo or whatever,
so I didn't really need to like meet new
[SPEAKER_05]: weed people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I liked learning what other people far
away knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of people used it in the DMS to
trade clones and do all this type of
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never really did that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was more like an in person kind of,
kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then when obviously when heaven
stairway got in trouble and they shut all
[SPEAKER_05]: that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got scared.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, you know, this era that we're
going to talk about, like 2006 on it
[SPEAKER_05]: really is CSI and Matt's era.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is where, you know, I might've
been lurking a little bit and poking
[SPEAKER_05]: around here and there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and even some other friends of ours
that aren't going to join, like,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, our buddy high and lonesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there, there was some people
that were, that were extremely active in
[SPEAKER_05]: that area and know a lot of the,
the, who, you know, who was, who was a
[SPEAKER_05]: jackass, who, who was kind, uh,
who was a problem back then, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: where stuff came from.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the interesting things about
weed is that it reinvents itself every
[SPEAKER_05]: five or 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you get all these new people coming in
and people get to rebrand themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's happening every six months,
it seems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's modern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modern marketing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mentioned that I mentioned this before,
but it was kind of like what the,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, what the old deadheads told me about
how dead tour used to be before the
[SPEAKER_05]: grateful dead had touch a gray,
a big hit where it was small.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody knew kind of it got vetted in,
you know, things didn't change that much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, um, you know, Oh my God,
big ups to Danimal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then, and then, and then there was a
top, they had a top 10 hit and literally
[SPEAKER_05]: hundreds of thousands of new people showed
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how do you assimilate them into your
community that fast?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't really, you know, it becomes
difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of times like old timers or
whatever, they feel overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause like the norms of their community
and what they could expect, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and instead of being like a respected
elder, somebody's like, who the fuck is
[SPEAKER_05]: this guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do I have to listen to you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, where before when it was
smaller, like those people might've had
[SPEAKER_05]: respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a much, it did get very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to say it wasn't quite at
cookies where everything took a big swing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it wasn't much long after cookies came
around that the forum, the whole idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: forums kind of changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that also had to do with
Instagram, which is also why cookies kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of even got even more blown up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, uh, social media.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of the difference between the,
I would say the forums were mostly writing
[SPEAKER_05]: with some pictures where Instagram flipped
it 180 degrees to being all pictures with
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit of writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you see some of these old write-ups
that people have and their paragraphs and
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, they're like a small essay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where people ask me stuff all the time on
IG and it's really hard because it's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: what are you going to write a novel in the
comments?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of looks lame.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're trying to write something that's
like this long.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what can I, it's like a haiku.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: How can I get my, my, my thing across in
like X amount of syllables or four
[SPEAKER_05]: sentences?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You kind of have to, especially if you're
on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, and then you end up,
and then you end up leaving out a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: nuance and detail where on the forum era,
people could like write three or four
[SPEAKER_05]: paragraphs each back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some like Kempi could write really,
really just bad, really bad, unillegible
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff for paragraphs and paragraphs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, when you write paragraphs,
you really realize why we invented
[SPEAKER_05]: punctuation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know why we invented paragraphs in the
first place, spacing periods, commas,
[SPEAKER_05]: all the various aspects.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really helps because you know,
one of the things that hurts you online is
[SPEAKER_05]: that nuance gets lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you being sarcastic?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you being funny?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your body language?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, all those types of things,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was actually a good point.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, in the overgrow era,
digital cameras, you know, didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I was talking, I was actually
talking about that in the, in the one that
[SPEAKER_05]: you missed because you were, you know,
you were otherwise occupied where it was
[SPEAKER_05]: like people documenting their stuff really
advanced a lot more when digital cameras
[SPEAKER_05]: came out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then exponentially once phones had
cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once phones had cameras, it was all bets
off.
[SPEAKER_05]: The era where you had to get your own
stuff developed, that's unsadly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not very documented.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not very documented.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I was at, I was at CSI's house,
I don't know, a happy year ago or
[SPEAKER_05]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were looking through a couple of boxes
of his Polaroids, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they fade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: They fade.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and maybe if you would have kept
them in some kind of like a perfectly
[SPEAKER_05]: sealed environment with the right humidity
or something like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you're looking at Polaroids from 95 or
six or seven or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of them, the colors are bleeding
into each other and it's hard to make.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, it's not, you know, it's not
shark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have never guessed that until he
told me that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, he's got a couple of
shoe boxes full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have busted his chops to get them
fucking scanned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you got to get those scanned
at least for history.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you won't do any good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I, you know, I had my,
I had my, my, uh, my first daughter in Oh
[SPEAKER_05]: nine, you know, and I think, and I can
look back on my phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, the first real camera
on an iPhone came out in Oh eight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Late, late Oh eight, you know,
and that's kind of that, that was a
[SPEAKER_05]: revolution in itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause then you can just pull it out of
your pocket and be like, there's my weed
[SPEAKER_00]: plant click.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always amazing that with all these
cell phones, we don't really see many like
[SPEAKER_00]: real documented UFO picks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm, it's kind of off tangent,
but I just thought about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I will say as a, as a, as a,
you know, somebody who's pulled a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: tarps in their day that, you know,
a lot of times when you pull tarp on you,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're doing light depth, you're,
you're pulling tarp at six or seven o
[SPEAKER_05]: 'clock at night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you go back out there after dark,
which in June might be nine 30 or 10 o
[SPEAKER_05]: 'clock at night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So pull the tarp off so everything can
breathe because you only want to darken it
[SPEAKER_05]: for as much as you need to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you don't want to trap in all that
moisture and all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you got to go out there and,
you know, Mendo or whatever in the woods.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes I would see the most
beautiful skies, the most beautiful moons.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just epic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And your phone could not show you what my
eyes could see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would take, I would take, you know,
pictures and, you know, and it would just
[SPEAKER_05]: never, and I'd go online and look,
how do I take better night photos?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just not a camera with like a
nice lens and, you know, the ability to
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you know, it's just not.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just meant to show dicks and tits.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all you're supposed to be taking
pictures of, fellas, ladies.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and, and so, you know,
there's, there's an aspect to that where
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like, I can bet, like, if you can't
see, like, nobody can imagine how
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful this full moon is tonight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can't capture that well.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you going to capture?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I'm sure there's like, this is the,
there's a weird thing in the sky.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's moving strange.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you going to, you know,
especially back in 08 or 09, how am I
[SPEAKER_05]: going to pull out my two or two and a half
megapixel camera on my phone?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to like capture it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it took a long time for phones
to even begin to catch up to like,
[SPEAKER_05]: what 35 millimeter could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're busting my skeptical comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so crushing my skepticism.
[SPEAKER_05]: I fully believe that there are aliens.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just disbelieve most people that tell
them, try to tell me a bunch of facts
[SPEAKER_05]: about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's I'm sure there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know if they've ever been
near earth.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like I, I have, I that that's
where my skepticism comes in.
[SPEAKER_05]: When people start writing, getting like
very long YouTube's about all kinds of
[SPEAKER_05]: specifics, you know, I get weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'll say this, you know,
and then Kayla, and then he's officially
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking late.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, you know, when we were talking
about the, the early, the early two
[SPEAKER_05]: thousands or whatever, I, you know,
I did that whole episode when you weren't
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hunting so hard for old stuff then
stuff from the eighties, stuff from the
[SPEAKER_05]: seventies, hell, even stuff from some of
the nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a royal bitch and nobody cared
about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, and I searched for years and years
and years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, like we have a pretty good
network of friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and it was really hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now within the last five years,
as ancient stuff has become popular and
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not, please don't take this the wrong
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody's holding anything,
but I've never seen so much like 79
[SPEAKER_05]: blueberry 72, you know, brotherhood of
eternal love, Acapulco gold, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: 74, well Hawkin, you know, this that like
all these seventies and eighties strain,
[SPEAKER_05]: all the famous strains of your.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Hey, it's not dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just blurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What'd you do?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's in that humble fog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smudge your camera on purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in that humble fog, you know,
so he blew a load on the camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but wait, the sun's going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we were just talking about the
different, you know, what was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: going around post 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the end of the overgrow era,
end of the cannabis world era.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe, maybe you could talk about some
of the things that you saw during those,
[SPEAKER_00]: those, that integral period between the
end of overgrow and the beginning of
[SPEAKER_00]: things like the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of, what kind of strains were
people fucking with around then?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the hot shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you talking about like 06 on 06 to
like 06 to 08 somewhere in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think that's when chem dog
really started becoming popular.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chem D came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I honestly think that that's the
year, you know, Mass G posted up on ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although that, that thread is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is that thread gone?
[SPEAKER_03]: I did my research.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the creation of sour D1?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, that's, that was the overgrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that, that's well long gone
unless somebody has a archives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who would have that shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you remember like around overgrow?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of the strains, what kind of
strains were mostly popular around that
[SPEAKER_00]: time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in the, in that end of overgrow era,
Amsterdam strains, Dutch, Dutch shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Canadian stuff?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: BC stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of, it was kind of like a lot
of the stuff that was at some of those Ron
[SPEAKER_05]: parties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're, we're actually where, where Caleb
and I first met, you know, it was a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: white widow and blueberry and a lot of the
work coming out of Switzerland was big
[SPEAKER_05]: then.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like the sweet tooth, the block head,
the Louie genius.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and C 99 were around back then
for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Genius C 99, you know, I forget is genius
Apollo, but you know, the Apollo 11 and 13
[SPEAKER_05]: hybrids of all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was, it was pre prereversals.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys hadn't really started your
revolution yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was all males.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we were borderline starting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's yeah, it was just kicking off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I was, I was selling his EXC way
back in like, I don't know what Oh two,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe even earlier on a cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did my first, you know, um,
real reversal in Oh six, the intentional
[SPEAKER_03]: reversal, intentional reversal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I, I did that one reversal where,
you know, I took a bunch of pollen from
[SPEAKER_03]: that Urkel back in like three Oh four and,
uh, yeah, yeah, that was Oh three Oh four.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, pollinated a bunch of stuff
on purpose.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that, that was just that freak thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of counts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It counts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does count.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was with intention.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there, there, there, I did have
some friends that, I mean, we didn't use,
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't, we didn't know anything about
any of the, any of the chems you could
[SPEAKER_05]: spray on plants, but people used to try to
torture their plants to get them to free.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it was, if you knew it can herb,
sometimes you could put it into too small
[SPEAKER_05]: of a pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could let it get dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could beat it up a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could try to collect, see if it could
throw some, that was like the,
[SPEAKER_05]: that was like our, our way of,
you know, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you beat it up enough to get some
pollen off it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, uh, so much, so much way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just flower them out for like 80 or 90
days and get a couple of bananas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You call it rotalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where he got that term from
for it, but yeah, I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a special guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually, I did like when his book came
out or whatever, I do like the Soma beds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't own that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just, they're just deep indoor
beds on wheels.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's basically what they were,
um, you know, with, with, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: some drainage in the bottom and some
layering, you know, maybe they have some
[SPEAKER_05]: rocks and they have some like,
and then they have a layer of,
[SPEAKER_05]: of a ground cover or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you put soil on top and they had
received, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: They had the air tubes on them in all four
corners where the air can come down to the
[SPEAKER_03]: lower roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: You would put like big pieces of PVC with
holes drilled in, and you would put those
[SPEAKER_05]: on the side and those would go all the way
in the corners to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that you would actually get,
and that would connect to the gravel at
[SPEAKER_05]: the bottom so that you could bring air.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't the worst idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done that with big trees.
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially for, well, it's not so much
you had to go trees, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, look at, look at,
look at a bunch of, you could,
[SPEAKER_05]: you could actually grow a bed with,
you know, homie style with 25 or 30 plants
[SPEAKER_05]: if you wanted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and then you didn't have to
worry about individual ones dying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you just water the bed and
everything stays alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to use those no drain beds way back
in 2000.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2000 or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: No drain beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just shallow, like six inch deep beds,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: How'd that work out?
[SPEAKER_03]: I did pretty good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely some interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was back in my not so organic days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The not so organic?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not so organic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I used, I used to know,
this used to be pretty funny where I used
[SPEAKER_05]: to know a lot of guys in Mend that were
organic, like April through August.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then come August, they're like not,
or September, they're not quite seeing
[SPEAKER_05]: their buds get as big as they want.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they figure like, well,
what's one big tub of pink powder going to
[SPEAKER_05]: really do to my organic?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's basically organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a couple, a couple doses of this zero
50 30.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to get me where I need to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to make it happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been organic for five months
already.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so it'll all flush out at the
end and it's definitely still organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That stuff was rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bud Blaster.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three cheers for Grow More.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Grow More was the cheap.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Bud Blaster was the, was the Canadian
heady version.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Canadian.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, it was, it was, it was one of
those, you know, powdered, whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all the, it was all the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a bunch of people that came out
with zero 50 30.
[SPEAKER_05]: And tried to make it seem like their zero
50 30 was special.
[SPEAKER_05]: The one thing I'll say about the,
the Bud Blaster is that they had a,
[SPEAKER_05]: they had their own special grinder.
[SPEAKER_05]: So their powder was super fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it actually dissolved some of the
cheap stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get there in like a thousand gallon
tank or whatever, and you're up on a
[SPEAKER_05]: ladder and you're dumping stuff like that
in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you get some softballs at the
bottom that you're like wondering how to
[SPEAKER_05]: hit with the stick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like to break up because it wouldn't
actually dissolve.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but that's off topic, you know,
I suppose we should probably ratchet back
[SPEAKER_05]: around.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got to convince, we got to convince
Caleb and Matt to talk because this is
[SPEAKER_05]: really their era.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is 06 07 08 09.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not my online presence.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the various characters, the various
things that were going on, the stuff that
[SPEAKER_05]: was happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty much, this is when these two,
you know, CSI used to be known as,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, White Trash Redneck.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but that, but that's where,
I mean, you know, uh, archive was doctor
[SPEAKER_05]: or the doctor.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's where a lot of the Monica,
a lot of the oldest nicknames and
[SPEAKER_05]: monikers, uh, people still kind of
reference each other, like by some of
[SPEAKER_05]: those first names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know nobody's real name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't need to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ain't no purpose in it, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And unlike IG, you didn't, you never,
a lot of these people you never saw.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike Schick always asked me like,
what, what's his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I don't fucking know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why the fuck would I ask him that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: She thinks I'm a freak for not knowing
anybody's first names after all these
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I don't fucking know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, am I going to do his taxes for
him?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck then you know that for?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very, it was very similar to that
on like on dead tour and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: because everybody, you know, everybody had
a nickname.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, everybody had a nickname.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, but yeah, I mean, maybe,
maybe you guys could talk about like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, uh, who, who, who were some of
the big, I don't want to say the word
[SPEAKER_05]: influencer maybe, but who are some of the
people that were sort of like driving the
[SPEAKER_05]: conversations?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who were you excited to hear, you know,
posting on stuff like, and then maybe just
[SPEAKER_05]: like how hard it was to get information
back then, because a lot of these forums,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, you guys were talking about the
chem dog, you know, there was an aspect
[SPEAKER_05]: where the reason why, you know,
somebody like, you know, skunk VA has his
[SPEAKER_05]: name or chem dog one-on-one or any of
these things is because I had some form or
[SPEAKER_05]: another on IC mag or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the first time these things started
getting argued about and debated by people
[SPEAKER_05]: outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of times what happens too,
is that these things become references
[SPEAKER_05]: because then you've got this guy comes out
and says this thing on IC mag at this
[SPEAKER_05]: year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then three years later on whatever on
roll it up, let's say he's saying this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now on IG, he said this and this,
you know, and they always, they always
[SPEAKER_05]: want to be like, this is the most current
story.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what you should believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, those forums don't
exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're very fortunate that they
don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, one of the, one of the ways
that, uh, CSI got his reputation as
[SPEAKER_05]: inspector is he was really good at using
your own words against you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I just, but I just mean in the sense
of someone would like confidently say
[SPEAKER_05]: this, this, this, this, and this,
and then he would be like, well,
[SPEAKER_05]: why did you write in your own words?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you, how do you make these two
things come together?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a bunch of swerve quotes I can
share.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and that's a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people probably don't even know who
swerve is, but there's been, there's been
[SPEAKER_05]: a bunch of people, you know, that come,
you know, flash in the pants that come and
[SPEAKER_05]: go.
[SPEAKER_05]: They come up, they have their moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, they, they spew a bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They make a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of a sudden their stories start to
implode.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, and in some cases they
rebrand themselves and sell it again to
[SPEAKER_05]: the, to the new badge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, who I looked up to is going
to be a lot different than maybe who Caleb
[SPEAKER_00]: looked up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when I first started coming in,
it was way different than when Caleb
[SPEAKER_00]: started coming in, you know, so who,
like, who were you looking up to during
[SPEAKER_00]: those years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or who, who is, who do you think was
influencing really well that, that had
[SPEAKER_00]: some respect during those years?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I mean, I liked, you know,
just, just for information, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, alone, I liked Joe brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked, uh, you know, chem dog,
mass G, uh, you know, skunk VA,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, and then on like the, the OG side of
things, you know, I was, I always liked,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, you know, big Ricky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he was old family red back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, a lot of people don't even
know, but, uh, I named my old family
[SPEAKER_03]: purple, my first TK hybrid kind of after
his old handle old family red,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I didn't even know that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I, yeah, I gave him a lot of
credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, Chrome, that was,
those were the years Chrome was starting
[SPEAKER_03]: out with the white, you know, he actually
was growing some of my, my hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then he introduced the white when
he was growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's when that started.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, I think I was mostly into Bubba's
OGs and chem dogs back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, uh, what, what were your,
your main, main interests though?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I popped in, you know,
like Shanti Baba, um, was still pretty big
[SPEAKER_00]: and still had a good name.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the stuff I was looking at when I
came in was, was Dutch stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really didn't focus a lot on Americans
at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it just didn't, I wasn't hip to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I hadn't, right when I came in,
I wasn't hip to the fact that all those
[SPEAKER_00]: dudes were white labeling and most of the
Americans are making their seeds or
[SPEAKER_00]: Spanish or actually back then,
I don't even know who was making the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother fucker seeds, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, it was very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, uh, greenhouse hadn't been totally
trashed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still kind of under the radar for
new people at the time that, that they
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing anything, you know,
untoward DNA was massive during those
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they were why I started doing six
seeds a pack because their shit was six
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds a pack and they were the ones
selling the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, okay, I guess that's what
you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sub cool, of course it just
started fucking taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was fortunate that I met Sonny
Chiba, um, very early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned very quickly, Oh,
maybe that guy isn't someone I should be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at for breeding tips, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a while, but I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's, it was, it was a much
different time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting then, because that's kind
of when everybody first came out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: shadows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can walk out of the shadows with
any stories you wanted about yourself or
[SPEAKER_05]: the strains or whatever else.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of times you were the only
person, um, you know, from Sam's Cuckman
[SPEAKER_05]: on, yeah, you were the only, you were the
only person telling the story about those
[SPEAKER_05]: strengths.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, do you remember, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: The audience was so small, finding people
who are actually there, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: was, was very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was a lot smaller than now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know you think people that came
later can grasp how small the community
[SPEAKER_05]: was and how slow information was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's pretty rapid fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and a lot of people connect all
the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, oh yeah, somebody said crunch bubble,
you know, uh, that guy, I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: he, that guy used to move massive amounts
of, what was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue dot through the third floor in
Oakland.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he had all those warehouses of
600 watt HPS is on hydro tables,
[SPEAKER_05]: bumping out a bunch of stuff for third
floor.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was, you know, what, what's funny
about that guy is that some of those
[SPEAKER_05]: pictures were like some of the first
warehouse scenes that people were willing
[SPEAKER_05]: to like throw up on IG on, on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people were growing in closets or
bedrooms or greenhouses or in the woods or
[SPEAKER_05]: wherever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of a sudden you see a 40 lighter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for a lot of people, that was the
first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might look rudimentary now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, now, but yeah, but even just then in
oh five or oh six or something like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, finding people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think too that like what most people
don't understand maybe is that a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: the, a lot of the breeders like that got
famous later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a couple of people on the show or
whatever, like almost all the breeders
[SPEAKER_05]: were European or American or Canadian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the people that were working breeding
in America were generally doing it through
[SPEAKER_05]: friendship circles.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot of trading and via DM
amongst friends and amongst
[SPEAKER_05]: contemporaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't like, like on, you know,
at least from what I remember,
[SPEAKER_05]: it wasn't like, oh, I've got a big drop
coming next Friday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the fifth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the 15.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the names I made up for him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the hybrids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's where you can get them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's how we're going to sell them all.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, you know, you'd trade seeds
when you saw people or people were
[SPEAKER_05]: trading, selling them via DM or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, but it was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember as far as Americans went,
there was not a lot of Americans doing
[SPEAKER_00]: direct sales on websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would never really see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was all done, you know,
DMs or like on weird little auction sites
[SPEAKER_00]: that were floating around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, there wasn't a really
good way to market yourself as an American
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder without mostly giving seeds away
to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, did you have that experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: CSI?
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I didn't get involved in any of,
I wanted to back in the 06, 08 era.
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked into it, but, um, you know,
I was, I was still way, way too paranoid
[SPEAKER_03]: to do any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, I could have done it, you know,
like, you know, DNA and sub cool and hell
[SPEAKER_03]: even swerve, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, uh, I mean all those guys,
you know, made huge names because there
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was no competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't really have to have a whole lot
of talent to be very successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone just said, Mr. Soul handled all of
SSSC in the eighties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, so I mean, what's
interesting about that is that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, there's been a lot, there's been
a lot of talk about American SSSC,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, Matt and myself got to
interview, uh, the owner, uh, who was very
[SPEAKER_05]: cool and you know, all that kind of stuff
got put to rest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hard, hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't, there wasn't any American
help, but that, but it goes, but it goes
[SPEAKER_05]: to show how, you know, in our world,
you can kind of step out of the shadows
[SPEAKER_05]: and be like, Oh, I mean, there was a lot
of people, uh, that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: they came out of the shadows and they were
the first time that people were like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, Oh, I'm, I, this is my cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it turns out that they just got
the cut early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they got a few years of like,
Oh, if you want to use my cut,
[SPEAKER_05]: you got to give me 50% of the proceeds of
the seeds or you got to pay me or you got
[SPEAKER_05]: to this or you got to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my work.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my, my, my, my, and then it comes out
later that they just got it from these
[SPEAKER_05]: other people early.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they were the first one to go public.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and a lot of times what happened
is, is that the first person to go public,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, you know, got credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, um, you know, they got credit
and their story was the story for a
[SPEAKER_05]: minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes other people would get upset
and get online and start, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I actually think that's kind of
what got, uh, you know, you were talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about, uh, chem that's kind of what got
chem online.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was, you know, skunk VA got online a bit,
you know, and started talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then people were like, Oh,
my weed's famous.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should talk about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that got, and then that got,
that got Joe brand and, and P bud and
[SPEAKER_05]: other people that hadn't really met,
met up or like even linked or even
[SPEAKER_05]: realized what was going on after 15 years
to connect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 707 seed bank, uh, Shahbud,
he's the one who, you know, got a skunk VA
[SPEAKER_03]: onto overgrow and icy mag to actually post
about that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I think there'd be a completely
different chem dog history.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he hadn't done that, you know,
do we remember what the very, very first
[SPEAKER_00]: claim of the chem dog seats, not
necessarily the first one people remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the very first claims of chem dog,
who was the first one to claim that
[SPEAKER_00]: strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it even Greg or were there other
people popping up as it was getting
[SPEAKER_00]: popular going, that's mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember anybody claiming it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, lots of people claiming they had the
91 or, I don't know how all these
[SPEAKER_03]: different cuts could be the right one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know, because it's purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how, you know, when it perps,
I saw a few chem dog cats and they,
[SPEAKER_03]: they, uh, uh, some of them look like a
mass super skunk chem dogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that, that just basically means
somebody bought some weed that was,
[SPEAKER_03]: was called chem dog and it had some seeds
in it and whatever had pollinated that
[SPEAKER_03]: chem dog, you know, chem dogs,
not a bad hermaphrodite just by itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not so, you know, and so usually
if you find seeds in your chem dog,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's been pollinated by
something else.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there was, there was also a thing
too, that was, that was really confusing,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, and this isn't anything against
Greg or chem dog, but you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's, it's like for people that want
specific lineages, he was pretty famous
[SPEAKER_05]: for when you buy weed, you're buying chem
dog weed from chem dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't really matter exactly what it
was.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was weed from chem dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think that created confusion too,
because everyone was like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's this one specific thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but it really was chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, back then branding was branding,
you know, it was, it was, it was early,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was an early form of branding for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and people weren't, and a lot of
these guys were young and nobody knew,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially then when things first started
getting famous, I don't think anybody knew
[SPEAKER_05]: that some of these strains were going to
be so lastingly famous.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of times they wrote down various
stories or this or that, and they didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: really expect it to get, become part of
Canon or become part of the fabric of the
[SPEAKER_05]: tail.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they have to look back into it
and defend it, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and you know, it's hard for people
sometimes to say, you know, my memory was
[SPEAKER_05]: a little, that's what I remembered at the
time, you know, after more, after more
[SPEAKER_05]: information came out and I talked to more
friends, I've kind of revised a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: because other people had, it's hard for
people to say that.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times you would dig in their
heels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you've got two or three or four
versions of the story and you're trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: figure out which one works, which one is
the most believable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what, what's your favorite
wildest story, um, from the forum errors
[SPEAKER_00]: that you knew?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you, that, that you knew was kind
of like, that's too stupid to even be
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any that stick out where
you're like, that was a bold fucking claim
[SPEAKER_00]: and really won't wonky.
[SPEAKER_00]: What comes to mind when I say that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hate to keep bringing up my boy
Swerve.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really have a whole lot to do
with him, but the guy he got pretty much
[SPEAKER_03]: most all of his early OG cuts from in like
06, 07, um, this guy, uh, had an account
[SPEAKER_03]: on ICMAG and then he made up another
account.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this was an 07 and he made up
another account pretending to be his own
[SPEAKER_03]: mentor, you know, with all the same
spelling errors, all the same,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, type styles, all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he made a whole thread on it and acted
like, you know, he was the original
[SPEAKER_03]: creator of the OG Kush, blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his boy right here, his little
student, you know, he's, he's the best
[SPEAKER_03]: student I ever had.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're of our boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we, we hooked him up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We laced him with all those, those cuts
we've held since the eighties.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still that story on, on,
uh, ICMAG it's still, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and I'm, I'm up in there with a
bunch of other clowns just laughing away,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, but that, that one right there
was, it was pretty much the tops for,
[SPEAKER_03]: for me back in those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, little old lady with Asian fantasy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that was a really good one too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was, was a, uh, there was a
string called Asian fantasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think it's fair to say about
the Canna Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason King pretty much made that strain
known.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a well-known strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, he, he talked about the
rarity and how this guy never lets it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years later, um, a person that we,
we, we know who it was, but I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: he'll ever admit it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went on and tried to say that she was the,
the wife of the man who held Asian fantasy
[SPEAKER_00]: and he has died and she wants to get those
genetics out there, you know, and ended
[SPEAKER_00]: up, I think pretty sure it was NYC kid,
um, kind of big upping himself,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to give himself some provenance on
a cut he never had access to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we don't, honestly, we don't know
that part of it because who, have you or
[SPEAKER_03]: anybody ever seen this Asian fantasy
keyword fantasy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Outside of the Canna Bible and NYC kid and
his crew?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's kind of a fantasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: African black magic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's some, there's some
pictures of it or whatever, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason King even talked about how homie
wouldn't give it out to anyone and you
[SPEAKER_05]: know, was a, was a massive hoarder of it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's an aspect to it there too,
where it's like people, people can hoard
[SPEAKER_05]: something so much that it doesn't become
famous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, because nobody ever sees it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like before, before this forum time that
you were talking about, there was probably
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you know, four or five people or
something in California that had the chem
[SPEAKER_05]: 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone just said, I have Asian
fantasy S ones from th gobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go NYC kid, you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I mean, it was like one of those
things where like, if, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: if, if OG Kush, if some of the,
if some of these famous things don't slip
[SPEAKER_05]: out and people don't start cropping them,
you know, there was an aspect where it was
[SPEAKER_05]: like for a long time, there was only four
or five garages pumping chem 91.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like every, you know, so how much weed
is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't really give you very much
opportunity to try it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't really get, give you an
opportunity for like a fad to,
[SPEAKER_05]: to, you know, like if OG hadn't snuck out,
if all those guys hadn't been money hungry
[SPEAKER_05]: down there in LA and it had snuck out,
it probably wouldn't have had that kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: impact.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it has to be there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be able to get at,
even, even if you have to pay a lot for
[SPEAKER_05]: it, you do have to be able to access it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Asian fantasy is one of those things
where like it, you know, it never got out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, so as a result of that,
it allowed scammers to be like,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how could you tell the difference?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you know, you, you still,
you still buddies with the, with old
[SPEAKER_03]: Jason, Mr. King.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't spoken to him in a minute,
but we're cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He lives on Maui.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if you can ask him kind of maybe
some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I talked to him before I like met
you, met you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he, he, he affirmed that,
you know, all my information was right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he was like, where'd you,
where'd you find all this stuff out?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the, I mean, he might know some,
some background details that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely didn't make it into the book
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been actually thinking about reaching
out and talking to him because one of the
[SPEAKER_05]: things that's interesting is that he
probably has a shit ton of pictures of
[SPEAKER_05]: weed from myself and my, and some,
and friends, and then people that I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: know, obviously too, but, um, that didn't
make it in the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, you might take,
you know, dozens or hundreds of pictures
[SPEAKER_05]: or something, and then two make it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You pick a couple, um, you know,
uh, and, and all that, but he,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, you know, and I think, I think the
Asian fantasy that he was talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: was in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say, I remember, and I could be
totally wrong, so maybe I shouldn't say
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but I think, I think Bodhi knows the
Asian fantasy person, maybe I might be
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna ask him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, to me, it's one of the,
it's, it's one of those like legendary
[SPEAKER_05]: strains, you know, that like just never,
I mean, you know, I'll mention another
[SPEAKER_05]: one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do any of you guys have any, uh,
any, um, uh, experience with Elvis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know if it was, I don't know
how real it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a cut called Elvis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause there's some really famous stuff out
there that just, it was never in my crew,
[SPEAKER_05]: never in like the extended circles of
crews.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you hear about them for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it got famous in various aspects,
but it's just like, you know, I also
[SPEAKER_00]: thought I had Albert Walker too though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is that, you know, like who
knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Never got it from a good source that they
could say, yes, this is where I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, last one I had, I passed off to skunk
master flex and I don't think you back to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your Albert Walker was the orangey
one, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go Walker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll day go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, did you ever see the mothership come
through?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember if you said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I told this story before, but like it
got mailed to one of our spots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, Jason King's, I don't think it's
shade to say this, but his girlfriend at
[SPEAKER_05]: the time was this chick named Rebecca.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she was from Asheville area of North
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so she, you know, he used to rave
about that cut all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so she finally got some of her friends
to send it to us.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And dude, it was like, uh, our buddy,
high and lonesome has a terrible story.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but, um, it was kind of like that in
the sense where I was expecting to get
[SPEAKER_05]: this tiny little box with some clones and
we got this box that was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, this big by two feet tall or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was two mothership plants in one
gallon pots with stakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And each one was about 18 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_05]: And oh, three or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like, so all those pictures in
the Canna Bible that you see of
[SPEAKER_05]: mothership, those all came from those two
moms that got mailed to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we mom those out and,
uh, you know, it got, they got grown at
[SPEAKER_05]: Eddie laps and they got grown to various
friends houses and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I actually had, I actually,
I had the mothership for four or five
[SPEAKER_05]: years, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, uh, it wasn't, I think it was a,
a super unique, uh, it wasn't one of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have, it didn't have the nicest
flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't really like the flavor that much,
but it had a pretty cool high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it did this weird thing where it would
fall half over, but then hold itself up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, you know how most branches,
if they flop, they flop, it would like
[SPEAKER_05]: flop, but then it would like raise itself
up and it would grow sideways through your
[SPEAKER_05]: garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost kind of a little like train wreck.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would get, would catch itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just like, and it had like these,
it was a really odd sativa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it had thin leaves and it was big
branchy thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but you know, I mean, I honestly like
compared to all the other shit we've been
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about, like Bubba's and chems and
you know, super scum.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, it was a little midsy,
you know, uh, in all reality, but it was
[SPEAKER_05]: one of those things that probably like was
genetically very different than
[SPEAKER_05]: everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I like, I like, you know, we like those
weird things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, real quick to touch back on Elvis
since you were, you were on THC farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff for a long time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least attentive to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I was on the outskirts of the devil's
harvest crew, um, back in those days too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, there was, there was some of
those guys that one circulated through
[SPEAKER_03]: that crew a good bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it, it started, uh, I think Iraq from
maybe like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I should say his stay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you know, uh, I think he's,
he circulated Elvis for a while through
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be surprised if a doctor maybe
had grown it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, uh, he was, he was real good buddies
with a lot of those cats.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, the whole time I was,
I was online.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only, I only traded cuts, uh,
through the mail, maybe, uh, I only
[SPEAKER_03]: received cuts through the mail twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, um, I, you know, 40, 50 plus,
you know, uh, packages that cuts by only
[SPEAKER_03]: received twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did all my other business just in person
up and down the West coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember, uh, Ms. Elvis from the
farm?
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't very active on the farm at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a person who showed like they were
the main person showing the Elvis cut back
[SPEAKER_00]: then there was something called like the
pink Cadillac cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was the Elvis cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's, that's the only person I ever
got it from, but I never, they disappeared
[SPEAKER_00]: like not even a month after giving it to
me, but they were the ones that were
[SPEAKER_00]: always documenting it on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I never knew if that was, if it's just
someone from that bullshit and made their
[SPEAKER_00]: way through because they disappeared so
fast, uh, after me popping up and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: it from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it super insensy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no, it was exactly like what they talk
about, like a vinyl smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vinyl, just artificial vinyl.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, not insensy at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that's kind of
interesting about that era too,
[SPEAKER_05]: is it's kind of like the last era before
like the, the clone name dominance things
[SPEAKER_05]: started happening where everyone's growing
OG or everyone's growing sour or
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone's growing all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was a lot of these odd strains,
you know, not on the sense that there's
[SPEAKER_05]: anything wrong with them, just odd,
odd random strains that were easily sold,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they, they, people liked them and
they got traded.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people weren't looking
necessarily for like, Oh, I need to get
[SPEAKER_05]: this specific cut because I'm going to be
able to move it and it's going to go for X
[SPEAKER_05]: price.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they were more interested in
like the legend or the history or whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: of, of said cut or the person behind it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could get on there and start
talking about your cut and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_05]: drum up a bunch of interest.
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially like if we wanted to go
back, you know, when we were talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: how small it was, I mean, think about how
revolutionary, you know, just some,
[SPEAKER_05]: some of Matt's favorite, some of blueberry
stuff got, you know, and how it looked.
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't that much competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't that much stuff outside of
Europe or Shanty or Sensi or, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: Simon from Sirius or some of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there wasn't that many American
breeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the few people that were doing it,
like, like Mr. Soul or, or DJ Short or
[SPEAKER_05]: whoever that were willing to, to show
their work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it kind of got like outsized,
you know, outsized impact, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: like since Cindy 99 probably got way more
famous than it should have, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: just to be, just to be, just to be
perfectly honest, I don't think in today
[SPEAKER_05]: it would have the same lasting impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not today.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wouldn't have, it wouldn't have been
able to break through, but it was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think because it is, is like when you
try to think of an outdoor plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's fast enough and still considered
sativa to most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's, it would be very hard
to find a replacement for C 99 that sat
[SPEAKER_00]: fast with those types of high qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that also had a major effect
because it was, it's a perfect outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: plant for blast and fast, you know,
and it could be grown indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just mean, it got like all his work got
real.
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't that much competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was a lot of time to talk about,
you know, like not only Cindy 99,
[SPEAKER_05]: but like we were like the genius or the
Apollo or this or that or whatever,
[SPEAKER_05]: or like, you know, everybody got plenty of
time to debate the four or five things
[SPEAKER_05]: that DJ released.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there just wasn't that,
there wasn't that many different things,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, there wasn't that many.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now there's, there's thousands of breeders
and so standing out is very hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it was like, you know, what was,
what was their, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: a dozen big people doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a lot easier for people to
keep other people down too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the ones at the top, since it wasn't
a lot of competition and they held a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of sway, they could really cut fucker's
throats real fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happened a lot too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a lot easier to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have probably got cut then if I
had even tried to start back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I was banned off every forum
and it got to the point where I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck this, I'm gonna start my own forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Mr. Nice, I never got banned from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got asked to leave after a picture
contest because the, the RiotBerry
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures beat out one of Mr. Nice's and he
thought that was kind of fucked of me to
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, all the rest of them,
it was really hard because a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones, a lot of people that were running
those forums also had a seed company and
[SPEAKER_00]: most of those seed banks and seed
companies would eventually start fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were one of those people to
speak up, you're done, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want you around.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see Mag definitely had some of that
aspect to it too.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was the in crowd and the out crowd,
you know, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just surprised that forum is still
alive after everything that went on with
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: See people, somebody talked about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: People talk about 89 Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was an 89 Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that gets that,
that annoys the hell out of me,
[SPEAKER_05]: honestly, and this isn't to call out
whoever has 89 Super Skunk, but just in
[SPEAKER_05]: general is like, they'll take the first
year that something was ever released or
[SPEAKER_05]: named and be like, I have that weed from a
year or two before then.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, so the first time Super Skunk ever
got used was in the 1990 seed bank
[SPEAKER_05]: catalog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when it had a picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when it had a name.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when Neville released it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and so people were like,
oh, I've got the 89 Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and then they're like,
oh, you know, then they got to come up
[SPEAKER_05]: with like, well, you know, it was all that
pre-release special shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I, my, my uncle was buddies with
homie who gave it down on special kick
[SPEAKER_05]: down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they'll be like, you know,
you know, I got that 95, 93 centsy star.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have pictures of that 1989
Super Skunk and they look awful cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty pretty.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, it happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you see a lot of these old cuts
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: The years keep getting earlier and
earlier.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean one thing, and this
isn't, you know, this isn't to,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, obviously a boaties use this or
whatever else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is no G 13 hash plant in the 88
catalogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: It came out in the 89 catalog for the
first year, 89 and 90.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but 88 is much better.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and I'm not trying to throw any
shade on it or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's plenty of people that have found
nice weed and you know, buddy made a bunch
[SPEAKER_05]: of hybrids with it and it came from NDN
guy, I think.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Originally or whatever, you know,
he reproduced it, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: it got released in 89.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But everyone calls it the great,
you know, the 88.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Close enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, some of that first PIF,
some of that first stuff they talk about,
[SPEAKER_05]: they'll call it the great 88.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That shit got released in 89.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a bunch of stuff out there
where people will be like, this cut is
[SPEAKER_05]: from a year or two before this line ever
got released.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a quick question though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I have zero experience in this
because I was living in my, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: whole and humble, but you were there so,
or maybe you were there years later.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the possibility of them doing
releases of their seeds at the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: cups?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is true.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like for instance, the first cannabis cup
I went to was the Jack Herrera cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole thing was themed on him,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was all about like, it was the
whole, like all the festivities were all
[SPEAKER_05]: about the emperor wears no clothes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they released Jack Herrera seeds,
you know, from in 95, 94.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: 95.
[SPEAKER_05]: They released them, but it was,
you know, it was late November.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it wasn't in the catalog till the
following year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was like literally, it was literally
the first time, for instance, Jack was
[SPEAKER_05]: dropped, was at the cannabis cup in late
November.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I suppose you could have gotten it,
Jack Herrera, at least six weeks before
[SPEAKER_05]: the year turned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, for example,
Salmon Creek Big Bud, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: homeboy from Salmon Creek, you know,
he bought those seeds at the cup the year
[SPEAKER_03]: it won the cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then smuggled 50 of those seeds home
in his little belt, you know, hideaway
[SPEAKER_03]: belt thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, you know, his selection from
those Sensi Big Bud seeds or whatever is
[SPEAKER_03]: what made Salmon Creek Big Bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's, that's definitely
possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times a lot of new seed releases
would get dumped in late November then
[SPEAKER_05]: because it was like an industry gap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was tons of, and honestly,
there was tons of custies there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ended up hating going to Amsterdam for
the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went three times and then never again,
mostly because it sucked.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason it sucked was that
Amsterdam is pretty far north.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's cold as shit in late November
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can go in summer and it's nice and
it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're on a bicycle and you're
cruising around all alone or you can go
[SPEAKER_05]: when it's sleeting and 29 degrees.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not as nice, you know,
and then all the best weed would get saved
[SPEAKER_05]: for celebrities that were coming in and a
who's who.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was worse weed to get because it
was all getting saved for, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: Snoop Dogg or, you know, Sam Skunkman's
friends or, you know, whoever,
[SPEAKER_05]: whoever the high times crew or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on top of that, you could buy
tickets to go to the cannabis cup out of
[SPEAKER_05]: high times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you go to Europe on vacation and the
coffee shops are full with all these dudes
[SPEAKER_05]: from Jersey and New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Screaming about wanting to get the best
bud in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like you fly 12 hours away from
your house and you're surrounded by a
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of obnoxious East coasters and
there's not as good weed and it's crowded
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's cold and it's raining or it's
snowing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, I much preferred going
there in summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, just because it was nice and
chill, you know, but it was like an event.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like the it was it was an event
then, you know, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: really like the story goes, you know,
Neville didn't even want to release Jack
[SPEAKER_05]: Herrera that year.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't think he didn't think he didn't
think it was done, but they wanted
[SPEAKER_05]: something new and hot that they could call
Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_05]: And isn't the story of fucking Cindy 99
that fucking dude bought Jack Herrera in a
[SPEAKER_05]: coffee shop and found seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then took him home and started his
whole cubing fucking princess,
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever thing that he did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think Rick did anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying that's the story.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he found bag seed in in buds
that he bought at a coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, or be 99 and genius or.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are both Jack Herrera at best hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And really like and, you know,
I think back then that was even earlier,
[SPEAKER_05]: like we weren't using the improper term
back cross yet or, you know, BX.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were talking about fucking wasn't it
cubing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was it was it was cubing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were cubing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were like fucking and they had all
those like long winded posts on on fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: the forums about what percentage and how
much it was increasing with every one you
[SPEAKER_05]: did and laying it all out, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was some really bad breeder tech
being shared that seemed cutting edge at
[SPEAKER_04]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, still repeat that fucking shit
like like mantra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you got to back cross it four times
and you get that's as good as an S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I saw and I saw somebody talking about
I like the super silver haze better than
[SPEAKER_05]: the Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole reason super state silver haze
exists is because Neville didn't feel like
[SPEAKER_05]: the Jack Herrera project was ready for
prime time.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just released it due to, you know,
Alan and Ben drunkers from Sensei were
[SPEAKER_05]: businessmen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when he left, he kept working on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a couple of years later,
I think in 97 or something, he they
[SPEAKER_05]: released Mango and Neville and super
silver haze because he felt like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, they'd actually gotten
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they still did a couple.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually think that was the last big
release that Neville ever did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, I smoked that that super
silver haze cut because to I went in
[SPEAKER_05]: ninety.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was basically like every other year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I went ninety seven and ninety nine
to the cups.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those last two cups, that super silver
haze was all over the place because that
[SPEAKER_05]: was that was in that was like the first
and third year at one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like the hot shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over there.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really was.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the hot shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was super.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a phenom of it that went like 14
weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Will the community let Rez back into play?
[SPEAKER_05]: Rez is doing his own thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, what most people don't know
about Rez and are are a couple of buddies
[SPEAKER_05]: remind reminded me of not that long ago
was like before all the bullshit with the
[SPEAKER_05]: with the law enforcement and all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a dick on line.
Anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a big time troll jerk, generally a
pain in the ass to get along with,
[SPEAKER_05]: not a pleasant homie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Despite despite any of the rest of the
bull, whatever you want to believe about,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, all the mess that happened
legally or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a he was an early troll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a jackass.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a huge ego.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he still does.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a decent level of intelligence,
which would have been, I think,
[SPEAKER_03]: much more appreciated if we hadn't had so
much ego with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little middle.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, not, you know,
a bunch of ego and a bunch of rudeness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there was some root.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was some rude people you could put
up with a little bit better, but they were
[SPEAKER_05]: like borderline geniuses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like Tom Hill could be a real
dick if you ask the dumb question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't know anything about being rude.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, you know, I mean, you know,
or Sam Skunkman, he could be a dick,
[SPEAKER_05]: too, because, you know, you get tired of
I've told the same story five billion
[SPEAKER_05]: times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to question me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're twenty three.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a cocksucker.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, eat my dick.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, rude, rude, kind of rude,
you know, but it's hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to have patience.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and let's face it, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of us are weirdos.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of us don't have the greatest
interpersonal skills to begin with.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, yourself really is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, speaking for me, I probably have a
little bit more than your average grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a bit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of them, it's like, you know,
we're kind of harsh edges.
[SPEAKER_05]: People that live in the hills don't talk
to people, hang out with plants and
[SPEAKER_05]: they're really good with plants and
they're not so good with social
[SPEAKER_05]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you put those people on the forums and
you put those people like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: on I.G.
[SPEAKER_05]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like it's not the easiest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have an adjustment period that I
will admit I had an adjustment period of
[SPEAKER_00]: where I may have been a little meaner in
responses and talking to people,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little snappy, maybe a little bit of
ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of us grow into beautiful smiling
faces like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm also still banned from Breed Bay
for picking on Subcool.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also it's also the way I look at it
is like, you know, I mean, everybody has
[SPEAKER_05]: the natural inclination sometimes,
but it's like, are you trying to get your
[SPEAKER_05]: point across?
[SPEAKER_05]: You trying to fucking argue on it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here's this dude who says his dad
created dog, but I remember that guy is
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to dox me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to block him.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, there you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the thing the thing about the one
thing we'll say about dog, but and then
[SPEAKER_05]: we'll move on is that Joe Brand and Peabod
were buying and selling weed on Dead Tour
[SPEAKER_05]: all the time for cash to go see dead
shows.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then this one weekend, they sold some weed
and then they mailed Greg some more weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then 15 years went by before they even
heard anything cool came out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They literally they never saw Chem 91 or
anything like that until 06 until the
[SPEAKER_05]: reunion.
[SPEAKER_05]: When the forums got people back together,
they had no idea they were on Dead Tour.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They met this, you know, you know,
these got Greg was and was a teenager from
[SPEAKER_05]: the East Coast and they sold him some weed
in Indiana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which was just one stop on summer tour.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're buying pounds and you're
selling eights and quarters and halves and
[SPEAKER_05]: ounces.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it ran out and you buy some other
pounds and you just keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you did that for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of these sales turned into
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now you want to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, 15 years ago, do you remember it was
summer on Dead Tour?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember this one couple pounds you
had that you were hustling for like a
[SPEAKER_05]: weekend?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any clear memory of that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's kind of important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think I think you might have
remembered just because he hit Joe Brand
[SPEAKER_03]: up, you know, G hit hit Joe Brand up again
and had him mail him some more weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two ounces.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't even know if the seeds came
from the Deer Creek show or the seeds came
[SPEAKER_05]: from the weed that Joe sent him later.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's from based on the stories I've kind
of deciphered.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it it came from the ones that was
sent that one had no seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, we know these stories are
a little up and down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, not to like two of my
favorite cuts of all time come out of G's
[SPEAKER_05]: little rooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will say that all of us on this
thing have tried to have tried to
[SPEAKER_05]: interpret what he meant by rejuvenating
the 91 after it got tired in 90.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I always rejuvenate them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rejuvenate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The rejuvenation.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had to let it go and rejuvenate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how you fix it from seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that shit never got explained.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and so I don't, you know,
there's when when any time you have a
[SPEAKER_05]: situation where, you know, we can even go
back and take, you know, like ancient,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, ancient Virginia skunk bud grown
for SSC or Mr. Soul, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: working for SSC.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you create these ancient legends
and it's like, how do you disprove them?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: In a lot of cases, you can't prove or
disprove because they're so old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's get back to the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the first place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember where the first like seed
bank, the first seed bank that carried
[SPEAKER_00]: your shit when people could actually buy
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we don't talk about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is it an unmentionable?
[SPEAKER_03]: I ain't friends with that guy anymore.
Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: My fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: That dude, a little loco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to remember, I didn't even start
my seed company until 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I could say one thing is that my
buddy that I never mentioned his name,
[SPEAKER_05]: but Staten Island, when we were doing all
the superdog work and we were doing all
[SPEAKER_05]: those hybrids that made it into the Canna
Bible, he had big dreams of realizing that
[SPEAKER_05]: you could probably make more money like
off of an eight lighter of seed than you
[SPEAKER_05]: could off an eight lighter of flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he saw what was coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: I honestly didn't believe him.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I didn't think I didn't think
that you would ever be able in America to
[SPEAKER_05]: like package up and sell enormous amounts
of seed or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: because at the time we were making all
this stuff and we were literally giving it
[SPEAKER_05]: away to good friends and stuff because we
had more than we knew what to do with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there wasn't an outlet for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the era that that Caleb talks
about getting involved is one of the
[SPEAKER_05]: earlier eras where you could really
actually start to sell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't simple in the beginning,
even even if you were an active breeder,
[SPEAKER_05]: finding out how to get it to the community
wasn't very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like even even with me,
I started the selling seeds directly
[SPEAKER_00]: really early for for a U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I first started, you still had to
really put your trust in someone in Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanted any kind of traction for
your seeds, if you wanted any.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you had to work with seed banks
for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eventually know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed bank didn't care you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably weren't fucking important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I looked at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were about to go into CSI after dark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I mean, you know, a good bit of
that was in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when D.J.
[SPEAKER_05]: Short wanted to get his blueberry seed out
there, he had to give it away to two
[SPEAKER_05]: different groups in Europe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: First, he had to give it to Tony at Sag
Martha, and then he had to give it to
[SPEAKER_05]: Dutch Passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he intentionally gave it
away, but I think that's how it ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: working out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't he purposely give them to him and
make he purposely did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he thought that he would still
retain all control and this and that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where he was probably mistaken.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in order for him to even like get
money for his seeds, he had to send them
[SPEAKER_05]: to an established seed bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: In a different continent.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how hard it was to move seeds then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, when he I think Sag Martha,
they had his seeds in what, like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the mid 90s or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right around there.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Internet didn't even exist then,
really.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did, but not not not on any level that
you were going to be able to use.
[SPEAKER_05]: Use it for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Overgrow started in either 98 or
99.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like the first forums, the first being
able to exchange stuff like how would DJ
[SPEAKER_05]: have even set up an Internet was going to
set up a GeoCities like fucking,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, web page and sell illegal beans.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, up until up until they
passed the the 2000 15 and in late 96,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was it was it was illegal in
all 50 states.
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't any there wasn't even a
legitimate reason you could possess any of
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think he feels burnt.
[SPEAKER_05]: He felt burned.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, what were you going to do
when you gave it away to the Dutch?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: If he didn't know that those those Dutch
guys were going to do whatever the fuck
[SPEAKER_05]: they wanted with it, then he was just he
had just done his groundwork.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, that's a Blueberry is almost a
full day's topic just by itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just meant in the sense that like
just to use it on the example of how hard
[SPEAKER_05]: it was to sell seeds, if you were a small
American breeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had to work with the Dutch just to get
it out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't an avenue.
[SPEAKER_05]: What were you going to do?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, you know, even like
early even early American seed sellers or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever used to try to fake that their
stuff was based out of Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, one of the things that
IG did and and the middle and and the sort
[SPEAKER_05]: of the middle era of to middle late 2015
was things opened up enough that people
[SPEAKER_05]: felt free to be able to like, you know,
you could have a Swamp Boys, you could
[SPEAKER_05]: have a CSI Humble, you could have a you
could have just these people that were
[SPEAKER_05]: like, I'm going to make my own packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to make my own beans.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go to these like gray areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be a Cannabis Cup Swap Meats
and Hustle Seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to start to mail.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can say back in 02030405.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, my buddy from Staten Island would
tell me about this stuff that he wanted to
[SPEAKER_05]: do and I would laugh at him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh, you want us to all go to
jail?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's what that's what it seems
like you're talking about to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started, I was one of the I think I
was one of the few people that pretended
[SPEAKER_00]: that my website was in Amsterdam just to
like try to hide under the shadows,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just because no one was doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fucking was a big red flag.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even waiting for that hit, even having
the infrastructure set up to be
[SPEAKER_05]: successful.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's kind of why there was so few
breeders back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it was generally done out of love
and you were trading amongst other people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there wasn't something like there is
now where somebody can be like,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh, I'm going to drop my Mac one drop and
I'm going to make 200 grand and I'm going
[SPEAKER_05]: to I'm going to I'm going to hype it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You really couldn't hype it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't marketing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't an ability to reach a big
audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it took a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in the era, you know, 06,
you know, through 08, even 2010,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, most of the marketing,
most most of the availability was all
[SPEAKER_03]: based on Internet forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that was yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people should also remember that when
Overgrow and Cannabis World got shut down,
[SPEAKER_05]: they got shut down because a very big seed
vendor got raided.
[SPEAKER_05]: Heaven Stairway.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was and that scared a bunch of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's still repercussions and
ripples hitting from that fucking bust.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and you know, and then,
you know, and and, you know, and people
[SPEAKER_05]: even in Canada and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that, you know, Mark Emory,
you know, I mean, he he went to fucking he
[SPEAKER_05]: went to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it wasn't any.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have any dealings with Mark Emory,
Caleb at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no interactions at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I was I was getting
cannabis culture or cannabis Canada from
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty much like the first issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've always been a historian.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, I have hundreds and hundreds of
cannabis books.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was, you know, for years I was
getting every single magazine that was put
[SPEAKER_03]: out on on everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've always been way more of a reader
than a talker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it helps put details together
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, no, no direct dealings.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the stuff I liked from from those
magazines, though, and and him were like
[SPEAKER_03]: the ABC stuff from back in the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the purple indica purple cush
stuff that was in those early issues as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and then Emory was working with the
same purple indica that's around now or at
[SPEAKER_00]: least a relative.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't Emory.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an article based out of
Snohomish County in Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it basically dated that that stuff
back into the, you know, at the very
[SPEAKER_03]: least, you know, early midnight.
[SPEAKER_03]: 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a question we were talking
about the other night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I need to ask not so that
I can't remember what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had something to do with how did you
make it to California?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: How did it make it here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who brought it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's a pretty simple story.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it ties into the forums.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people in 06, people started getting
excited about ChemDog and the ChemDog
[SPEAKER_05]: story because it started getting posted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Caleb was saying, Shaba got got
Skunkvay to start posting about his
[SPEAKER_05]: recollections and different stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and then, you know, that's kind of
actually what started to reunite people
[SPEAKER_05]: like Peabud and Joe Brand and ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all started chatting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe they even called like the the
seeds that ended up being the one through
[SPEAKER_05]: four, the reunion seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, yeah, the number four they named the
reunion Fino.
[SPEAKER_05]: A reunion Fino.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it was like they had all they'd
all kind of met up as this, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: like different people were like,
hey, dude, they're talking about your
[SPEAKER_05]: story on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so ChemDog hadn't actually had the
Chem 91 in quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had gotten in trouble and lost it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had been working with some of the
ChemDog super skunk hybrids that he had
[SPEAKER_05]: and bag seed and different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when it got famous again, he wanted it
back.
[SPEAKER_05]: But nobody had it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he got he got skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got Skunkvay to go back east with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, if you bring it back to
bring it back to me and I've got this
[SPEAKER_05]: different one that you guys don't have out
there and I'll give it to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he went back east and and saw a dude
and gave him the and gave him the dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Greg gave him the D.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he came back and mom did up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how me and Icy Collective both
got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was Skunkvay that did it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Skunkvay.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was him.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was it was all it's he's the reason
it's he to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the reason it's on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: He put forth the effort.
[SPEAKER_05]: He went back east to see ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_05]: He gave he gave the dog to ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got the D.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was I think if I remember to I
believe that ChemDog tried to give him
[SPEAKER_05]: back the MSS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he just said that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was the shorter one that was in the
high times and it wasn't what homie
[SPEAKER_05]: remembered at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes a lot of sense, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then he came back and he grew it up
into a mom or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Icy Collective and myself got it
not that long after that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And but to me, it's like the reason it's
on the West Coast is is Skunkvay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, on Greg on G's tour, he he he
dropped it off in the, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: area with Swerve the ChemD in 06.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is off of 06.
[SPEAKER_03]: He and Swerve traded him a bunch of fake
cuts for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, no big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he stopped at he stopped at,
you know, Obsolete's in Central Cal on his
[SPEAKER_03]: tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he stopped at Joe Brands and then
he headed up into Oregon and stopped at
[SPEAKER_03]: some other folks place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think he might have given them the
ChemD, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he he stopped at a good handful of
places, giving cuts out, selling weed at
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries, all that kind of stuff on
his tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: His, you know, reunion tour of sorts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was like first week of August 06.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sounds like Skunkvay went over there
earlier in the year and got the same or
[SPEAKER_03]: similar cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seems like there was a few cuts that got
passed out that year.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, so but that's that's kind of
that's how that's how the and that led to
[SPEAKER_05]: a bunch of stuff that led to the one,
two, three, four getting popped and
[SPEAKER_05]: started to get traded around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That led to the D.
[SPEAKER_05]: That led to the one through the four and
the D and all that starting to get added
[SPEAKER_05]: to the mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that the weird thing about
the chem stuff is that my buddy disliked
[SPEAKER_05]: the cysts quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: He thought it was ugly and he didn't like
how it got him high.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he never brought it west.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it never really percolated around
our crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we way later we saw some of the
S1s, but not the actual not the actual
[SPEAKER_05]: first one.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So but yeah, I mean, that's and I,
you know, I'm pretty sure, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: he I never lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never lost it after Skunk gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, and that's that's the kind
of thing like, you know, CSI and I talk
[SPEAKER_05]: about it all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, are there strains where like
the chain of custody wasn't broken?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because once you lose the chain of
custody, you know, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets hard, you know, like because who
knows?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you try to you lost the sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: You try to get it back.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember you lost this.
[SPEAKER_05]: You try to get it back.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember, you know, so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, kind of like when 707 Chabot
got his bubba back from me, I don't think
[SPEAKER_03]: I did it on purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got mixed up in a flat because I was
bringing a ton of people, a bunch of stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: at a party.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like a year later, he's like,
yeah, inspectors bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, what's this inspectors
bubba?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had bomb threat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.
Not.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was like, my bad, my bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ain't trying to give you, you know,
the fake.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not fake, but you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'd take a bomb threat over over
original.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you can always get a new bomb threat
if you have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, try to question for you since
we've kind of meandered away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: forum stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you see a side?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any work with Jesus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you planning any work with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if I could find a mass super scunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was for you, too, really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was telling him last night that I think
he should because I think it's a it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: rad clone, but it is it is very finicky
and it does make it a lot harder to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: off reversals on unhappy finicky shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would it would be really kind of
attempt to remake like a sour type from,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, building blocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, you know, we all have the
the ninety one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, what building blocks,
you know, it might not have to be the
[SPEAKER_03]: exact thing, but what could you get close
enough to to make a sour diesel out of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the original building blocks?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think diesel leans closer to a sour type
than it does a chem type personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, definitely.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cool one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people want to hear something about
Irene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they want to hear about
Irene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've already told the story of
Irene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you have any good Irene tales?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, she's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had Irene for a little bit and didn't
realize she was she was, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: as as nice as she was until I think I grew
outdoors in maybe 2008, I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to fudge the fudge the dates,
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, she came out so nice back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, good old fashioned Atlanta,
Atlanta's finest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is a special.
[SPEAKER_03]: Special one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it doesn't have a whole whole lot
of a story, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just another another bag seat,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it boils down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a fucking bag seat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that is one of the most humbling
things about reading is that a lot of the
[SPEAKER_05]: most famous strains are total accidents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you put a bunch of time and work
and effort into stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, your air conditioner
goes out and some shit herms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the seat off of that is better than
anything you tried to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think a lot of times when it comes
to like these stories, the the accidental
[SPEAKER_05]: weed is so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what makes people want to try to like
shoehorn in that they had some intentional
[SPEAKER_05]: part of making it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so much that I was just there or we
got late.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't want to say, well, I just got
lucky in my room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to be like, oh, well,
I did this and I did this and I did this
[SPEAKER_05]: and then that happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, now it's all the weed that you
all want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, everybody's got to work their stud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that how it's done?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but but really it was more like,
you know, I was I had my room.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ended up partying for a few days.
[SPEAKER_05]: I fucked off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I walked in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was some bananas.
[SPEAKER_05]: I found some seeds trimming.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like 99 percent of bag seed
stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that that's kind of why I believe
Matt, Matt Berger and Josh D story,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's not impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a it's a herm, you know,
in a little closet under the stairs story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like, who makes that stuff
up?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, I it that's very humbling.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also do think that a lot of that 90s
weed, it just goes to show that when
[SPEAKER_05]: you're crossing things that like aren't
when you're crossing real fire,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's a lot easier to get.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like was was Neville an amazing
breeder or did he just get to get the best
[SPEAKER_05]: of the best from America and cross it
together for the first time?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an there's an there's arguments to
both.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he was the first person to cross
and now and skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I was thinking you should get Tom
on and try to get figure out a little more
[SPEAKER_03]: details about pine tar and all that kind
of stuff, because love to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think he even knows who I am to
get him on or he's not likely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's banned off IC mag.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I mean, let me ask you like a
real question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that he would be better for a
live or do you think you would be better
[SPEAKER_05]: for a lightly edited podcast?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or something?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, probably a heavily edited podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we definitely Matt and I have
definitely interviewed some like
[SPEAKER_05]: knowledgeable old timers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, yeah, no, Tom's a character.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like him.
[SPEAKER_03]: But man, he'll.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's there is a question everybody
is asking and it's up to you if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if you want to deal with
this one right now or save it for a full
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, Caleb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Backstory on Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say yet because, yeah, let's say you
want to save it for a full show of some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I still have some groans to do on
that whole thing, but yeah, man,
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be surprised if it's not just
an S1 of that green sherbert cut.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's there's just too too many
similarities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the whole, you know, heterozygous
homozygous thing between the two of them
[SPEAKER_03]: really kind of leans towards it just being
as one of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I could go on and on on some
comparisons on, you know, how some of that
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff could could potentially make sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll save it for another time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that is going about that is that
CSI and I and Matt, we all talk all the
[SPEAKER_05]: time about how when you compare stories to
what the plants tell you, how they breed,
[SPEAKER_05]: what their S1 look like, what what they
look like when they get crossed.
[SPEAKER_05]: To different things and how what your eyes
tell you lines up with what the story is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and sometimes it sometimes it
adds a lot in terms of what you see,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like about I have a hard I have
a really hard time believing that the the
[SPEAKER_05]: CIS, the 91, the Chem D and the one
through four all came out of the same bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're just too vastly
different to me, you know, but that's I
[SPEAKER_05]: wasn't there either.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and a lot of this stuff is like
the most famous stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all almost because almost all of them
come from accidents and because a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: them come from other people, it's like the
people that marketed stuff or marketed
[SPEAKER_05]: skittles or marketed cookie or whatever,
like they probably, you know, different
[SPEAKER_05]: people get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it doesn't get quite as famous.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you know, and they should get
great credit for marketing it to the point
[SPEAKER_05]: that they did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 percent that I've never disputed that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I give lots of people accolades
for more successfully marketing and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, building, you know, clones that
would never have been anything up,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, to what they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I've always, you know, frown on,
of course, is, you know, people being
[SPEAKER_03]: dishonest doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you can do it honestly and still
be successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, having to just make up big old,
big old, you know, fictitious backstories
[SPEAKER_03]: or act like you're the one responsible for
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why instead of, you know,
I mean, there's cats like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Josh and Matt are like, oh, yeah,
it was a harm accident under the stairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's other cats, you know,
who are like, yes, we created that from
[SPEAKER_03]: our multi-thousand plant grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't we awesome?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We popped, we popped 15 seeds and the 20th
was the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the truth is the biggest factor
for me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, there's an aspect where,
and, you know, we should say this too,
[SPEAKER_05]: is that truth is a, most people,
everyone likes to say they want the truth,
[SPEAKER_05]: but like people that really care about it,
it's like a really small percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people like truth if it helps them
burnish their money or their reputation or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the truth is usually boring.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people who are looking for
excitement from the truth, they're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be like, oh, well, that was lame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when the answer is 99% of the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was a bad seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, yeah, or, you know, or it happened in
an accident at my buddy's house or I was
[SPEAKER_05]: at this, or I was, you know, like,
you know, you were early involved and you
[SPEAKER_05]: know, the story, even just knowing the
story is cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then people want to be part,
like they want to be this active component
[SPEAKER_05]: that was critical to the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did forget someone earlier that was
really important when I was, was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, coming in and that was,
that was doing reversals before I was,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was rascal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think I would be remiss not to
mention him because he was doing good
[SPEAKER_00]: things and had legitimate cuts,
you know, for the most part, as far as I
[SPEAKER_00]: know, like he was doing good fucking work
and he was doing it at a time when it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't pocket money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, he really, I'm not, maybe not all,
but like the vast majority of the stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: he had some really nice cuts and he was
crossing them together and they led to
[SPEAKER_05]: some really nice things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, white fire, you know, a lot of
people don't even know like about the
[SPEAKER_00]: white anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like not a lot of people talk about it,
but that was the essence behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the white fire, that was fucking
cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one I'd like to touch on too in the
future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, you know, the Swamp Boys,
Big Ricky in particular, he's alluded a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot to knowing exactly what the hybrid of
the white is because it's supposedly a TK
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrid, but you know, he likes riddles and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And secrets, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaks and riddles and limericks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call it a haiku, hillbilly haiku.
[SPEAKER_05]: He likes, sometimes I wonder how long he
takes to craft some of his Instagram posts
[SPEAKER_05]: and how to make it like, you know,
he, cause he's got his own language when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen, have you seen stuff like
the white inside the TKS ones?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one plant in our first run of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where, actually there was, there was,
there was four plants that we pulled out
[SPEAKER_03]: of the first run.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one was a green girl scout cookie,
like a green form cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other was a plant that looked just like
the white, you know, not so similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was obvious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was the number 50 and the
51 were, which were my two actual
[SPEAKER_03]: favorites of the whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, I, I smoked both those
heavily and the 50 turned out to be my
[SPEAKER_03]: absolute favorite of the whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's the one I kept and still
play with from the first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I did another hundred plus,
you know, TK S1 pop and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: got other selections from there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Caleb, what do you think about cookies?
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a question for when asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that goes into the category of
2000, what 2010 and on for 2010,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2011.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: People, people ask a bunch of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, I mean, it's a story,
you know, and it's a story that like,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a lot of pieces that aren't known
that well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a definitely one that's going to
create a, it's, you know, it's a super
[SPEAKER_05]: popular brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of money involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of rep involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't get it exactly right there,
it's going to be gunning for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a relevant one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a relevant one for you,
Caleb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to S1 any of the NL
selections?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was going to leave that up to you,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we might.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we might.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think they'd be worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they'd do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I like my feminized so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll grow some of them at S1 NLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we kept him here for goddamn a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know he's got a busy night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get back to packing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else anybody wants to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the next drop Caleb and where
can we find it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't know if I'm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dropping dead, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next drop is dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well go check out HumboldtCSI.com,
correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your eyes peeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always putting stuff up on there on
and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't often announce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep checking back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still waiting for those next drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still waiting on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nato's next drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, where the fuck's that at Nato?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's slowly developing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's slowly developing through,
you know, I'm not that I'm not that public
[SPEAKER_05]: of a guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's changing though.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the both of you basically like
if the two most important people for you
[SPEAKER_05]: guys seeing my face on a weekly basis is
the two people on this talk tonight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guaranteed without them, I would not be
showing my face or chatting about stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: They both push.
[SPEAKER_05]: For quite a long time to get me to tell
stories and talk shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So really, it really is.
[SPEAKER_05]: They gave me the confidence to say you
people would want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk history.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, and there's an aspect to it
too, where it's like a lot of this stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: we're talking about with you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what we have all been doing
amongst each other privately for fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've all heard each other's stupid
fucking stories a hundred times.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is, this is really how
information gets information and cuts gets
[SPEAKER_05]: saved and shared.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, history survives.
[SPEAKER_05]: And generally the point of all this is to
get, you know, versions of history out
[SPEAKER_05]: there and gets passed along.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So other people can hear it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, it's just not a wash in bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone keep your eyes peeled for a
sterling, a sterling green drop
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, eventually, eventually, eventually
when it comes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's asking about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I figured I'd plug it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was a bunch of good questions
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't get to, uh, as always,
if just because, just because you asked
[SPEAKER_05]: and we didn't chat, um, you know,
doesn't mean it's not, it's not
[SPEAKER_05]: worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can always message us about them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we're always looking for different
things to chat about what people have
[SPEAKER_05]: interest in, you know, so, uh,
keep all that stuff coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: We always appreciate your guys.
