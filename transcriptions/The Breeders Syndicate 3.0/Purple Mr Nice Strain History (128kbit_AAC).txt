[SPEAKER_00]: Your Purple Mr. Nice, I know that one up
in your area, did you grow any of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Purple Mr. Nice is a little weird,
in the sense that it supposedly got G13 in
[SPEAKER_00]: it, and it's one of those things that when
Neville went to jail for 11 months,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then Sensei gave him a bunch of money
and got him out of jail and bought his
[SPEAKER_00]: seed company, some of the things that were
common in Neville's seed catalog didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: port over to Sensei, like any of the G13
hybrids, any of the hash plant hybrids,
[SPEAKER_00]: the maple leaf, all disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the late 90s, after Neville
left, the maple leaf, the G13,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Afghani 1, all those things started
popping back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if they pulled them from
seed, but I think that's where it came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Mr.
