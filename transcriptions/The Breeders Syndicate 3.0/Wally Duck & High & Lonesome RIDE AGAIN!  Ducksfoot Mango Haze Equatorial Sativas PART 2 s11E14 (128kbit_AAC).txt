[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_02]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_02]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_03]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_03]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_03]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something that we were talking
about before we hit the record button,
[SPEAKER_05]: which was maybe seeing a trend,
seeing more NLD in people's work.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you guys think about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, highlights.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you observed like more interest in
NLDs recently?
[SPEAKER_05]: In like the American side of things?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's coming from more people
being able to home grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, it doesn't seem like it's made
any impact on the commercial market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been in dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I've been in dispensaries in
Maine and Colorado recently, and when you
[SPEAKER_04]: ask for a sativa, they'll tell you they
have Sour Diesel and Chem 4, and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know, that's not, that's not
what I'm trying to smoke right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think with the expansion of home
growing in the U.S., a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_04]: looking for, you know, weed that they
remember from when they were younger,
[SPEAKER_04]: or maybe just a different experience in
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the seeds that I make and the plants
that I grow are, I like the effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I want weed that I can smoke,
and it gets me motivated and makes me feel
[SPEAKER_04]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I can get stuff done.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the psychedelic stuff in the weed
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a lot of people do,
and a lot of people are just starting to
[SPEAKER_04]: look for something different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a ton of good work going on
out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the Band-Aid Hayes thing is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been a kind of a resurgence in it,
and I like seeing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish there was more, but I think
everybody should try some of these more
[SPEAKER_04]: NLD plants, try the effect, see where you,
where, you know, it can be life changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're, if you're just smoking Kush all
the time or Kim Dog all the time,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and you switch and you smoke a
good Mango Hayes or a Band-Aid Hayes or
[SPEAKER_04]: Northern Lights Hayes, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it can, it can change your outlook
on life.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're more present,
you're more engaged.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, I really think everybody should
get some experience with it and,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, kind of get away from just the
standard dull high you get from a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: the modern genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, random question for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there many blue or bonnet NLD crosses
that you've done?
[SPEAKER_05]: Any, any plans for some?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like off the top of my head, I think most
of that stuff was pretty Afghani dominant
[SPEAKER_03]: when I was doing that work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had gotten done with a bunch of years of
doing nothing, but mostly I wouldn't say
[SPEAKER_03]: like truly narrow leaf dominant stuff,
but more leaning that direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think during that era, I was,
I was taking a completely different
[SPEAKER_03]: direction because the market was totally
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see it for sure, but I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much longer I'm going to
go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cash was the only one I could think of.
That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that one, that was like, uh,
that plant was really weird because it was
[SPEAKER_03]: narrow leaf, but it was short and stocky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The blue dub put out some fucking pretty
tall shit, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm one of the eight foot sideways.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one that I forgot about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That still is like, I'm thinking a lot of
tea lane.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: It went a completely different direction
than I thought it would.
[SPEAKER_03]: Barry stomped it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know if there's any plants or
stuff like that, if there's any demand for
[SPEAKER_03]: it, maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just thinking, cause the,
um, you know, the blue side tends to be so
[SPEAKER_05]: squat and Afghani, you know, make for an
interesting hybrid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Wally, what's your take on like,
you know, it sounds like you've,
[SPEAKER_05]: you've done a lot of NLD work and what's
your sense of its place in like the scene,
[SPEAKER_05]: modern scene.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you see that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you see it like kind of like up
trending now?
[SPEAKER_05]: A bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also, I was going to say too,
because work like H and L is doing
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing it with things for people are
familiar with the chem and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are smoking that and going,
Oh, that, that other bit in there that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not familiar with, which is the manga
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I wouldn't mind trying that,
you know, that, that tends to help,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, everyone needs to smile more,
man, you know, and, and be more uplifted
[SPEAKER_00]: and happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what that, that's what that
stuff's for.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also makes your dick bigger.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes your dick bigger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, now the second time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's how we're going to make a
spike after that spike in the night
[SPEAKER_03]: increases the, the turgid and,
and a girth.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up surge now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It started here, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was this show that sounded at all the
resolution.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just some false marketing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, well, I mean, we've been talking about
NLDs, but have you, have you worked much
[SPEAKER_05]: with BLDs in your time?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best, the closest I've had is,
you know, things like East coast,
[SPEAKER_00]: South diesel and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which obviously they're slightly longer
flowering than a lot of the more pure
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani sort of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I was never much of a fan of it,
but, um, my friend, Mr. Moon, he,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, he used, um, uh, Tom's deep chunk in,
uh, in, in one of his crosses he made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, yeah, I smoked a fair bit of
that, but said dreamy sort of stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes you a bit sleepy and hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it wasn't really, um,
I liked it, you know, cause I like weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't need to be sleepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I could do without eating
sometimes too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That deep, that, that MBS he made,
man, you just couldn't get away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was cooking stuff, you know,
like a lasagna or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm eating stuff while I'm
cooking the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it never even interfered with the meal
I was about to have is just pigging out
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the munchies severely that stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's our bubble that you worked with is
pretty decent as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I found some good plants in the South
bubbles that 99, like it was pretty domain
[SPEAKER_07]: on the Z 99.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I know my mate found a couple that
were on, um, a bit more narrow and tall.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I grew four and that was
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stocky thumbs, beautiful Cush smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big leaf on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Massive like Jurassic park.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew this like palm trees, the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So biggest leafs I've ever seen actually
on, on a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get broad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was from, um, all my bin chicken.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I kicked them over.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a good, good bog line.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had him the old, Oh, go for a brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to ask Wally, but when we were
asking about the, um, well, the plan she'd
[SPEAKER_07]: worked with before, I forgot to touch on
the Laotian.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, what was the Laotian the one that you
knew?
[SPEAKER_07]: And most of the hybrids, what was it like?
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, where'd you get that seed stock
from?
[SPEAKER_00]: From, um, a guy BLB bad lower back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, he lives in that province.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke about already in Udon Thani in,
uh, in Northeast Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of like right beside Lao
and, um, he had some Lao friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: Lao Asian friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said this stuff was like the best
sativa he'd ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, which pricked my interest
straight away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, what'd he say there?
[SPEAKER_00]: They bred it for a few generations,
but then I wasn't really sure if they
[SPEAKER_00]: meant generations of cannabis or
generations of the family, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he sent me some and I grew that and,
uh, man, that's fantastic weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that sort of stuff that, uh,
you know, today's stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes you to zero to a hundred in,
in, in like three seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff was gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it still got you there, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it didn't dump you like today's
stuff does where you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're suddenly, you're not that high,
but you're sleepy and you, you can't be
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked doing anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff, you were just sort of like,
well, I'm not really high anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're better off than you started.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, yeah, I, I was thinking about it
because I remember you asking me
[SPEAKER_00]: previously about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest, I have so much trouble
describing the actual smell, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can only say it smells like Asian
weed to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can't dissect smells like,
I know some guys on the forums and I,
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to how they do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, ah, how can they get that out of
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like my, my nose just doesn't do that
for me or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, I guess it's mango here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that smell in there, but I can't
really dissect the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like a nice warm mangoes,
Asiany sort of smell that like the skin of
[SPEAKER_07]: a Thai green mango sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: More than spices.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent got that salary sort of
bit in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, but I, um, I, I sent some to,
um, oh my, I was trying to think of his
[SPEAKER_00]: name, but, uh, and he asked why I selected
the, why I crossed it with mango highest,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was my goal and, um, euphoria
because they were both euphoric and I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought they'd compliment one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, they, they did so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yes, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He loved the stuff and he's got a bunch of
awesome shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think him and him and I have got similar
sort of tastes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why he appreciated the,
the, um, Lao mango and, um, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent, you know, we got a lot of local
guys here that grow, grow wheat,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, mostly sativa and, um, uh,
a couple of them that have grown that they
[SPEAKER_00]: just love the stuff because it just does
the right thing for them and big plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: good buds, you know, with it, with nice
flowers, uh, and, um, resistance to mild,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their customers, they just keep coming
back for more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that, that's that euphoria,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just kind of get enough of a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause like most people came up around us
and my age came up on the Indica stuff,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I went to, um, living in Europe for a
bit, got up to Holland a few times and got
[SPEAKER_07]: to try some of the hazes.
[SPEAKER_07]: But my mate's dad, he was an importer from
back in the day and he was always just
[SPEAKER_07]: growing all his old seed stock.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was like never the most knock on
your ass stuff, but it was just like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you're at a party.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it did creep up on your beautiful
effects.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my interest.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's pretty much my whole seed
collection now who are a little bit indica
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff, but mostly it's just, you know,
from yourself, high and lonesome white
[SPEAKER_07]: buffalo seeds, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bunch of stuff from Matt, a bunch of stuff
from, um, yeah, more sativa sort of realm.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, I got a bunch of that super low
crosses from you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to get some over to H&L as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I reckon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know why we call it super low?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't actually call it super low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone else did, but it was, uh,
a bit of a pun, uh, with Neville,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be honest, cause he got, everything was
super, super silver haze, super skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a, I had kind of a very broad
question for, for both of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and we'll start with high and
lonesome, which was, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you look back at your breeding journey,
I I'm always curious about the kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: balance or tension between like,
how do I put it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a conscious, intentional plan to make
something versus like reacting,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, to maybe accidents or like,
I don't know, kind of like just going with
[SPEAKER_05]: what you have had at hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does this question make sense?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, I always have, uh, goals.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always write down projects that I want
to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I have this really bad habit of like,
whenever I have a little bit of space or
[SPEAKER_04]: whenever I really just feel like it,
I will pop a whole bunch of something
[SPEAKER_04]: that's not on my schedule to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I right now have a lot of seedlings
that, you know, I wasn't really planning
[SPEAKER_04]: on doing anything with, uh, but now I,
I am, um, so I, I try, but I kind of go
[SPEAKER_04]: with my, go with my gut, go with my
feeling, uh, on it, you know, I,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I don't know that I was planning on
doing a mango haze project, but I love
[SPEAKER_04]: those plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's, um, it's probably not the
best move, um, you know, for the modern
[SPEAKER_04]: market to do something like that,
but it's what, it's what I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make things that I want to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make things that, um,
you know, I think other people should
[SPEAKER_04]: experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, I, I've tried the gold thing,
but I'm not very good at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, I feel like everyone must deal with
that, that tension a bit of like,
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this is what I thought I was going to
do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I ended up doing this instead,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, when I, you know, when I popped the
mango haze, I had, I had a bunch of super
[SPEAKER_04]: silver haze at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a bunch of the, um, Neville's mango
haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a bunch of Northern lights,
five haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I kind of thought I was going to
go with something like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: super silver haze or Northern lights,
five haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, the mango haze was just the one
that I liked the most.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's a, it's a great line.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, it's like we've said, I mean,
it's you for happy weed makes you feel
[SPEAKER_04]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it definitely, it definitely gets you
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's, it's strong weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I just, you know, I wanted to see
that mashed up with some of the more
[SPEAKER_04]: modern stuff to, you know, get people to
maybe deviate from just chasing clones and
[SPEAKER_04]: trying out something that's a little,
you know, a little longer flowering,
[SPEAKER_04]: but has a completely different effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll put you in a different head space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the kinds of questions that
like, I want to ask more kind of about
[SPEAKER_05]: how, just like how life impacts your
projects and how, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: how you deal with that basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, yeah, Wally, same for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when you look back on the stuff
you've made and how it's all gone,
[SPEAKER_05]: how much of that was like, how much of
that work was, was you just working to
[SPEAKER_05]: plan versus you just reacting to what
you've been given or, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: what happened at a particular time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's probably 50 50, but I like H and
L I go into everything with a,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a goal in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it's, it's about my tastes and
likes really, but not everybody has those,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also make other stuff and,
um, so I, I test everything out,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I, I give it to everyone else to test
too, and see what they like, do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, not everyone has the same taste
as me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some stuff that was unintentional and
just an accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can end up being something that's
appreciated more than stuff that I've had
[SPEAKER_00]: a goal to do, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my, my, my like is, I guess,
similar to a couple of the guys here,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe all of you, but I like satire,
dominant stuff and, um, not everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: does, but, um, so we have to give them
options, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind something that gives them
gifts, gets you to sleep too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we all have to do that at some
point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about you, Matt?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like in with your work, Matt, how,
how much of it would you say is like,
[SPEAKER_05]: okay, this, this was all like planned
intended.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got there or I didn't get there versus
like, oh yeah, I had no idea that it just
[SPEAKER_05]: happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to think that everything was
planned, but I think I stumbled fucked my
[SPEAKER_03]: way through like the first decade of doing
anything realistically.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much of it actually met
goals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, a lot of it was just simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, especially in the beginning was
simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I want to make a, you know,
like for example, stealth auto flower or,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, especially during the, the era where
purples weren't as popular or at least
[SPEAKER_03]: true breeding magenta purples.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, definitely that was all intended.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but like the end fry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how often I met goals,
like a bit of the blue bonnet stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's just because it was so easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think like realistically to set a goal,
meet it, be happy with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I think I just stumbled through
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I could lie and say, yeah, I was
fucking from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, no, I think it's really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think there's anything wrong
obviously with, with, with having to,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, deal with some randomness or
chance in life.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're both valid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I mean, yeah, people make like,
I look at 90% of the market and these ship
[SPEAKER_03]: shit for brains or you know, like crossing
whatever to whatever, as long as it's
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies releasing it and bam, it's elite.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a valid way of doing things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't really piss on it for the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're probably making more money and
have more interest in fame than any of us
[SPEAKER_03]: will ever get, but at the same time,
it's not something I'm totally into,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's, you know, I guess there's
like a sweet spot, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, somewhere it reminds me of like making
art or making music where there's going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be a degree to which you have a plan and
there's going to be an element to which
[SPEAKER_05]: like something's going to happen that
you're not expecting and it might be good
[SPEAKER_05]: or it might not be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and I think that's just life,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you plan to return to any sativa stuff,
Matty in the future?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that Padana tie, um, it's got a lot
of fucking esteem behind it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have loved to get to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you got any like stock that you could
work forward or I have so much,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, just even, even like heirloom land
race stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That I've collected over the years,
but like also as I've, as I've learned
[SPEAKER_03]: more, it's, it's harder for me to pop some
of that stuff, knowing it's not in the
[SPEAKER_03]: right climate and that I'm not going to
see it as it was intended.
[SPEAKER_03]: So expression wise, I don't know how valid
it would be to like run it, try to make
[SPEAKER_03]: data points off of it, use it,
knowing how plastic cannabis is,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and in expression, I mean,
you know, so it could be hit or miss
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to do more, but the market sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it is changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, high and lonesome stuff selling
really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yeah, I'd like to do more of it,
but I mean, I don't really do much right
[SPEAKER_03]: now as it is, so we'll see, see how the
next year goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we'll have to, I mean, the first
thing is to get you smoking again,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's happening sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying, I'm telling you, I'm snapped.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fully snapped on not smoking.
[SPEAKER_07]: What about yourself, Willie?
[SPEAKER_07]: How did she keep on?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you still on the break for the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, still breaking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought if I, if I did that Thailand
move that I spoke to you about that,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I'd have to get like a vape or
something because, you know, you just got
[SPEAKER_00]: to, got to get into it when you're doing
that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm still, still happy not imbibing
that, um, and I have a bong here,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, for guests and, you know, I'll give
them some weed and here's the bong,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and, uh, you know, they can get
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I like getting people high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not that fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many times I've been
high, but one or two times.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just a few.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of times in the water.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all right, mate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have, we have a couple of like
pretty fun, more like just questions
[SPEAKER_05]: about, you know, uh, life history,
the forums, you know, Thailand again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but was there any other recent work
that either of you wanted to talk about,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, that you've done before we move on?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got HL?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I've, I'm always doing something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I, I've kind of been going back
through some of the Appalachia crosses
[SPEAKER_04]: here recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I just finished the pollination with,
uh, I called it Southern Gothic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Irene Appalachia and that one was,
it was definitely not a narrow leaf type.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a very strong Indica type
plant, but, uh, I hate, I hate the Irene
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted, I wanted something with some of
those characteristics, but without having
[SPEAKER_04]: to grow Irene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so, um, um, I, I went through some,
I, I kept a couple of plants around to
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe, maybe mess with some feminine stuff
down the road, but you know, mostly just
[SPEAKER_04]: for headstache.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, while I was doing it,
I made some crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I crossed it to some narrow leaf stuff,
uh, across into Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've, uh, I've started popping that
stuff now and looking through some of
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I have above, above a hybrid I'm
messing with now as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I'm in a weird position.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I, I like to smoke a lot of
sativas, but it kind of drives my wife
[SPEAKER_04]: crazy when I don't have a bunch of Indicas
around as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I kinda might, you know, like for the
last few months, it's been a lot of,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of Hayes hybrids that we've been
smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like I have to do something
else to appease.
[SPEAKER_04]: That side of my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but you know, there's some,
there's some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I do plan on, on doing,
doing some more sativa stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I mean, I have plants going now in the
next, you know, month or two, I'll be
[SPEAKER_04]: pollinating some of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Wally, any, any, anything else you
want to say on any recent work that we
[SPEAKER_05]: haven't touched on yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just tossed a bunch of stuff in,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it was H&L's, um, East Coast Sour
Diesel Appalachia, but, um, some,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Deep Chunk OG, Sour Z99, whole bunch
of stuff with soury sort of gasoline-y
[SPEAKER_00]: notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put in, um, that, um,
that stuff I think might be webbed hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: because if those things, if it is that
stuff, then we're just going to up the
[SPEAKER_00]: octane of those other things by miles if
we, we didn't make, make some crosses with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I'd give it a go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I'd give it a go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, cause people like that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, that was my real, other than like
sativa is that, you know, high octane,
[SPEAKER_00]: massive, strong turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was all over that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stronger, the better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it didn't melt the paint off the wall
when you blew it out, fucking she wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: strong enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like, it sounds like it smelled
like Death Star, which I know y'all
[SPEAKER_04]: probably haven't seen that down there,
but that's a really just offensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's like, it's, it's an insane
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: The taste doesn't come through,
but the smell is so strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells just so foul.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one thing with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The taste just doesn't hit what the notes
hit in the, in the smell for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: The high also, I don't think lives up to
the smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, it would be really good
paired to like a candy or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want like that, that nose,
but like taking it up a level potency
[SPEAKER_04]: wise.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to accentuate the aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like that too.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got plans to dip into any of your old
like Thai or Laotian seed stock wall.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, it's just not the right time of
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get them to flower outside at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I want to see how they do
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, because I don't know those sorts of
things that they don't really like indoors
[SPEAKER_00]: and I, I can't see how they do well
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can't see a proper
representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see what they get, how they go
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll have to wait till the later time
of year when our hours are heading
[SPEAKER_00]: downwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, um, I got a whole bunch of stuff,
uh, like, um, mango Thai and chocolate
[SPEAKER_00]: Thai and, um, a couple of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must have like about 10 or 12 at least
sort of Thai stuff I've been sent and
[SPEAKER_00]: then, uh, several Lao and, um,
some mullin baby madness as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's just not the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the time for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I'll save what I think is good in
what I'm doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, maybe I'll hit them with some,
you know, some Lao and stuff like that and
[SPEAKER_00]: make some repos and fuck I'm going to need
a bigger fridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I just thought of something a long
time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's probably well over a decade
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about the Papua New Guinea gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Panji gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you know about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not really talked about much
by anyone, but I know like for,
[SPEAKER_03]: for a lot of people, it's a white whale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I had some, but they lived in PNG when
I was a little kid and, but, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a guy, uh, uh, when I lived in
Melbourne, I had an Indian friend visit up
[SPEAKER_00]: here where I am now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he bought some back some PNG gold and,
um, I grew it indoors and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was hard to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a real, uh, uh, weapon chair sort
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you went in the doors, you know,
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, man, that stuff was amazing,
beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So resonance for like a land racy sort of
thing, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, such a strong, beautiful smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I have some stuff labeled PNG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll grow them and I'll see what they look
like, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have like, you know,
seed shops or anything over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a bit, it's a bit random and you
know, you probably get something called
[SPEAKER_00]: that from there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it may not have anything to do with
what we used to know it as, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's how it goes sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you find it, put me on the docket
for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always stuck with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You talking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it always sounded super fucking
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, beautiful, fruity, resonance,
delicious, you know, the stuff that sticks
[SPEAKER_00]: in your memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's always the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that stuff's definitely in my memory,
that PNG gold, beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's such a unique part of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bit crazy, but it's a bit messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once bloody, the Westerns, you know,
influence took a hold of it over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really didn't fare so well.
[SPEAKER_07]: See they're having riots and stuff at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're having like riots and stuff at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there'd been some natural
disaster.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that the stink bug weed, mate?
[SPEAKER_07]: That PNG gold?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that stink bug weed that you talked
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think it was the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this was really fruity, resonance,
sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to think when that was,
it must've been like in the late 80s,
[SPEAKER_00]: early 90s, I was growing that indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got some stuff actually here from
a friend of Overgrow who's a local where I
[SPEAKER_00]: live.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not living now, but he sent me some
stuff that he said it's PNG crossed with
[SPEAKER_00]: our local weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he rates it pretty highly,
especially where mould resistance is
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned because the area he lived in,
it just rains all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a plant can like survive there,
it's like bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure the PNG stuff would
have to be pretty rain tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It rains a lot there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's in the jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's right on the equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the turnaround from the seasons,
I think I remember my mum saying it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like only two weeks of the year,
it didn't rain at four o'clock every day,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the rest of the year it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you could set the clock by it
every afternoon, four o'clock,
[SPEAKER_00]: bang, there was the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it'd have to be special for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I reckon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, them saving stuff like that,
I don't really have a good hope of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing it, you know, it's all very random
stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even worse than us.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had, well, Booz had a question about
your seed, the state of your seed
[SPEAKER_05]: collections, the two of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to tell us a bit about what
that's like?
[SPEAKER_05]: While you mentioned the fridge earlier,
you know, how much of the seed have you
[SPEAKER_05]: had to feed to birds?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: How much stuff do you guys have?
[SPEAKER_07]: You lost your seed collection at one
stage, didn't you all?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the main sort of one that you
collected over the years?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at two stages or more sometimes,
I don't know, but I've gotten some back
[SPEAKER_00]: from other people at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, after that,
you've collected a whole lot more,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I probably got a few kilos at
least of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a whole fridge that's dedicated
to seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of it's like herbs and
vegetables and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the fridge I don't open as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell a lie because I keep the beer in
there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, not the bloody beer
fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the coldest one, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the best for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does get cracked open now and then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funny bugger.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about you, HL?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your stash looking like now?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I lost mine probably, I don't know,
13 or 14 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a fire and lost a ton of stuff,
but I've rebuilt it to all that it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a lot of things from friends,
a lot of things from readers that I like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I have an ungodly amount of
things that I've made that I need to look
[SPEAKER_04]: through.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always trying to find a better
organizational system, but it's the better
[SPEAKER_04]: part of a fridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even some of the older stuff I have,
I have it in a deep freeze, stored away,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I've had good luck with pulling
stuff out of there and popping it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just trying to beat time or slow down
time because there's a ton of stuff I have
[SPEAKER_04]: that I really want to check out and dive
into.
[SPEAKER_04]: But especially with some of these longer
flowers, flowering things, you've got to
[SPEAKER_04]: set aside half a year or more just to
check out a line.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a pretty giant collection that I
will never get to 75% of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that sounds like everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Wally said, kilos of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to sort them in the year that
I made?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you come up with a way of doing it,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep thinking I find something,
but it never really works out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have stuff in jars.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have stuff in vials.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no standardized system in my
fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all over the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I lose stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about Matt?
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt, what's the state of your collection
like?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's big bags like, I don't know,
10 gallon Ziploc bags stuffed in the
[SPEAKER_03]: fridge, totally unorganized.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know me, I don't want to organize
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: When people ask for certain things,
I'm like, yeah, I got that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll take me a year or two to find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Poor local keeps wanting the Cali Mist,
the old original pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cali Mist from Sirius.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, yeah, I got that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I pull it out and go to send it
to them, I lose it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I feel bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it like the first round Cali Mist?
[SPEAKER_04]: First drop?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know about first drop,
but it was, I want to say it was 99 to
[SPEAKER_03]: 2000 when it was made.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked a site based on the catalog
number.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just right there at that period
where it's still probably a valid pull of
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to find those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you see that Cali Mist F2 I put in the
chat?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: That I posted up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got some old stock from a fella from
Maine.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kicking like 30 to Shawnee kids.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was looking for some mail.
[SPEAKER_07]: So see if we can find something to hit to
the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got some, I've got like another 40.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got more than enough shit to get to.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to take them H&L,
I can flip them over.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And give them to your son.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get them going on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's only like four or five
left in the original pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like a little pop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but the AK one is having
more from the same year that were
[SPEAKER_03]: reproduced.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I imagine they'll pop, but we'll see.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to leave our seed
collections in our will to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poor bastard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Time's going to local.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fishing law collection on seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who's getting my glass dildo
collection, but they're going to be a rich
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_07]: You promised them to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rich, rich man.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you putting out H&L this year
for?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause what June at the moment,
have you got a bunch of Hayes cuts in
[SPEAKER_07]: depth at the moment?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or what are you planning on growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, in, in my depth right now,
it's more, well, actually I do have a five
[SPEAKER_04]: out there, but I have some sour,
some shoreline, the F cut OG, EB,
[SPEAKER_04]: a bunch of, a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do have a second round lined up for
my full term.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is kind of all over the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a lot of super sober Hayes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing cause that's kind of a standby
probably do an increase on those as well
[SPEAKER_04]: as, you know, it's about that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I popped some of the sweet pea bandaid
Hayes from local.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really looking forward to trying that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We, we went on a fishing trip recently and
it was a bunch of us and that,
[SPEAKER_04]: God, that the sweet pea and the bandaid
Hayes were the hits.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were smoking pretty hard on those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good old Rob Clark was there smoking
pretty hard on those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it really good time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you like the Peter and Glenn?
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, it's a bit heavy for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like bedtime lead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those, those Indicas like that,
I can't, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I can, I can smoke them.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I keep going and smoking them
throughout the day, I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I let it lag a little too long,
I just want to take a nap.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so I've, I've gotten to the point
where that's kind of like, that's stuff I
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke when the sun goes down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I can't smoke it all day like I
used to.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I popped all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some stuff from Lush, the C5,
with Destroyer, which sounds incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I popped some more of Wally's Neville
Hayes, Mango Hayes, because that one,
[SPEAKER_04]: that one ended up being really,
really good smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of, I, I tried it, you know,
cured it and put it in jars.
[SPEAKER_04]: I smoked a little bit of it and I was
like, oh yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little terpenaline to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But very Neville Hayes leaning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I kind of just left it for probably
six or seven months, five or six,
[SPEAKER_04]: seven months, something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I got back into it recently and
that shit will, I mean, it makes your
[SPEAKER_04]: forehead sweat.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to like, you got to go out and
take a walk.
[SPEAKER_04]: That, that shit will knock you on your
ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very racy, very strong, gets you
moving weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I popped some more of those because
they did well outdoor here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually, it triggered a lot quicker
than Mango Hayes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they ended up finishing before the
Mango Hayes, which surprised me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, was that the C5 Neville's,
was it H&L?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was the Neville's Mango.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you make a C5?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you make a C5 Neville's?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, C5 Mango Neville's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew a bunch of them this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Locals got a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, but I tell you what,
I wonder if my friend that I grew with
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't mix some seeds in, didn't put,
end up with some Lao Mango ones in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the difference between the flowering
on some and the others, man, it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: six weeks different, which I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's like a Neville's Hayes
leaning thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: But just seemed like, like a miles out,
but really good though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Neville's Hayes surprised me a
little bit with its early maturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen some from Shanty go the long
distance, but other ones were quite early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always wondered maybe that was an F2
or whatever, but you know, I'm not to say
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone's the purity of anyone's stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that one that you did an increase on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, I only had, I got a little bit
of Neville's Hayes from a friend online,
[SPEAKER_00]: which he said he it's pre 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some reason that's a cutoff for
people where they think it might've been
[SPEAKER_00]: different after that, whether it was or
not, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still a large, large cola, you know,
earlier maturing larger cola, not as
[SPEAKER_00]: satire as some other people I've seen
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, it's not really an F1,
so you can have a lot of differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually could finish most Finos of
Neville's Hayes here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you get the frost hitting them a
little bit, but you know, you could get
[SPEAKER_04]: them done here pretty consistently.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find it really strong, super strong.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to me, it takes a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like as they cure, they get strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the Neville's Hayes in
particular, the A5 is like that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you smoke it fresh,
it's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with a lot of this longer flowering
lines, I'll let them cure for months
[SPEAKER_04]: before I really get into them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they, you know, they get better with
age.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones with age.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this has been probably one of my
favorite conversations on the show so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been really loving it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really happy, you know, that the two of
you can ask each other questions and stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously with plenty of input from Booz
and Matt as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys want, I thought we could move
on to this section on the forums.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I know that both H&L and Wally and
of course, Matt have all spent a good
[SPEAKER_05]: amount of time on the forums.
[SPEAKER_05]: Booz, do you want to kick this one off
Booz?
[SPEAKER_05]: These are most of your questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I will note, I might have to say an
Irish goodbye soon, but I'll, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll slide out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Slide out the back door like a devil in
the night.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wally, what were some of the first forums
that you were jumping on, mate?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I know I think you said that African
lady that you found was on some Aussie
[SPEAKER_07]: forum, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was that just a... No, it was this
thing called Leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf, I think something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how I ended up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've not long got a computer, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like look up weed forums or chats or
talks or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was like some, something
called Leaf, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I met that African chick
and she wanted to... Oh, she had an ad
[SPEAKER_00]: there to selling African weed,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've messaged her and said,
do you guarantee this stuff ever arrives?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, well, it's so cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not try it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, it was cheap as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it was pre 9, 9 11 too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think borders like, you know,
got a bit stricter after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But during those times, things were a
little bit more open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, I sent her some money and
said, yeah, I'll have some of your Durban
[SPEAKER_00]: poison and some of your Swazi or whatever
it was she had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it arrived and I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And weed was a little bit average,
but then I said, did you ever get any
[SPEAKER_00]: hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, she had some, a couple of sorts
of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she sent me that and it arrived and
she was a, she sent me some pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a hot chick, this hot little
blonde girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she, I sent her seeds and I sent her
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weed never arrived to her,
but... She can have whatever she wants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did have a friend in Africa too,
in South Africa there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Johannesburg, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said, look, I'm not that far from
this chick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me her address.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so I gave her the address and he
said, yeah, this chick, she's packing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got kilos and kilos of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like some fucking big dealer girl,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, I sent her some ducks foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, she has got this plant in the
front yard of her house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like eight foot tall and like eight
foot round with these fucking gold pool
[SPEAKER_00]: buds all over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ducks foot that I'd sent her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, you could smell it through
the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she didn't seem to care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, I met this other
dude on the same forum and he kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: linked me up to Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also to Gypsy, he was a little bit
strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Gypsy even said, man, this guy's a bit
weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, he ended up exiting or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of like how I met Gypsy as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: When Gypsy calls someone fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know they're fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's how I met him and how I
got on the Overgrow forum initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I was new to computers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like fucking early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had like the millennial edition of
fucking Microsoft, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, everything was new and fresh back
then.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wayne and Teddy Picks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were good names.
[SPEAKER_07]: Indonesian 99.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember these auctions back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck, some of those auctions, some of the
stuff on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember a guy called Dog's Knob?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dog's Knob.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the big buyers on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that guy with the Barber Kush,
the first guy that come online with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Barber Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ogusha Kid or Ogusha Kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organ Kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Organ Kid, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke to both of those guys a fair bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ogusha Kid, he sent me seed and I sent
him seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent him seed and said, you know,
like fucking whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sent me money.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he sent me money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never arrived.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then eventually it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you know, he was true to his
word.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like fucking all this American
money in this sachet somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dog's Knob, yeah, he was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to buy up all those auctions,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that Ortega?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dog's Knob?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that Ortega?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dogless.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always get the dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, this is Dog's Knob, like Dog's
Dick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how he got that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I'm sure what he was looking
at when he fucking come up with that name.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just made me cough out my bong gun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I call myself?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I haven't so heard from him for
a while, but I still hear from Moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just heard from Moon yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was in some trouble for a while,
because New South Wales is not a good
[SPEAKER_00]: place to grow weed and get caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking their street is down there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Kanga got done down there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Sen Moon might love, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was one of the few people on Mr. Nice
that always had my back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, even even before we were
friends, he went out of his way to have my
[SPEAKER_03]: back and make sure I didn't get fucked by
a few people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always appreciated him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Him and Smokin' Moose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smokin' Moose was a legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's passed on now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, he's a good man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Moon, I said he hadn't been doing
anything for a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stopped smoking and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I took, I don't know how many
years before I went like, fuck,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try this number that I've got of his
and it might be him still.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was like years and years
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he answered the phone,
yeah, it's him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kept the same number.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sent him a bunch of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he wanted to get back into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's fizzily growing and selecting it
as we speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be, it would suck to lose a dude
like that, like in the scene, because he's
[SPEAKER_03]: a special dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he loves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just loves it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: People with that sort of passion,
we need them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's still a few around, which is good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's been a bit of a resurgence
lately, like people popping back up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, you might, you might not
have lost contact with anyone,
[SPEAKER_07]: but like getting to meet Bucketbongs and
Southern Sunseeds, Sunny and stuff like
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's still people kicking around.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to chat with them a permanent
sort of, one of those Instagram things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I hear from Bucketbongs all the
time, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a nice man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us are reserved, you know,
we don't, yeah, we're going along a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, but this guy, he's fucking an
excellent social man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he could do one of these a breeze,
whereas some of us introverted sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: fellows, it's a little bit harder for us,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get used to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get used to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a bunch of dick jokes,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dick jokes and weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, for you straight guys,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you ever have much interaction with
the boys down in Nimmin?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I know you said you went to the
Canna Cup that one year.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's the year Jason King was
there, which is funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: But did you ever get to see any of
Malloway's gear?
[SPEAKER_07]: Tony Bowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I met Tony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck, his weed was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a couple of bongs with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was of the, of the lot of them,
the best I had down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, really nice man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that other guy, called?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's two, like a 20 foot tie
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know him?
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 foot, 20 foot or whatever his name was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him, I met him and, and fuck talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck, he talk underwater, that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, fucking very passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who else?
[SPEAKER_00]: The, I asked at the, it's like Oasis Cafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was one of the popular,
like hang out, places about Mulla Madman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they know, they knew him and,
but they said they hadn't seen him at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never got to meet him, but yeah,
I'll say the guy that ran the,
[SPEAKER_00]: they had like a cannabis cup there thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy that ran that, I can't
remember his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was that, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a legend as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a German bloke, Chiba,
a German fella who lived down there for
[SPEAKER_00]: ages too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I took some, I took some hash with
me and like, it's really good hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I, so I go to like do this entry
with him and, and he says, we,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't even have a, a, a, you know,
a category for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but we'll take it, you know,
I thought, oh yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we get to like, there's all the
photographers and they do it looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the, you know, the, the entrance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look at this hash and I think it's
not like the ball I gave him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure, you know, it's like a gram,
you know, and he comes over to me and
[SPEAKER_00]: says, he says, I'm not putting that hash
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just prime.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're keeping that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just put a little bit in.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was the year that Jason King
was there for Canna Bible two or three.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Canna Bible two.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I remember seeing, I think I sent
you a photo cause you're a golden
[SPEAKER_07]: pineapple was kind of Bible three,
but in number two, there was a pic of him
[SPEAKER_07]: in Nimbin with like, they had like a bunch
of Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: So G 13 hash plant crosses.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had Tony's Blackberry, which I always
wanted to see the Malloway one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they had one picture of a bit of hash
on a table.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I reckon that's the year that you were
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that's probably, yeah, no,
that probably is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest, like I would have
thought that, you know, it would have been
[SPEAKER_00]: the strongest of everything they had
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it was, but it didn't score as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I had a bunch of them complaining
that they couldn't judge anything after
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fucked them up and whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't been down ice often.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I went for years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause when I come back from Europe,
the only weed I could find was just that
[SPEAKER_07]: fucking PGR shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, no, not smoking it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's what I come up on basically
from like an early age.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I saw.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when I went to Europe that I had
in Switzerland, mostly Albanian weed,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it was pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just obviously some Dutch stuff
that they were growing and then going to
[SPEAKER_07]: Amsterdam too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then coming back home, I only have an
access to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, no, not going to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I pretty much went to Nimbin like every
two weeks for fucking years, just go back
[SPEAKER_07]: down, back and forth, back and forth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, cause there was always good stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like people rag on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you like know someone down there,
like when the lame boys were there,
[SPEAKER_07]: they had fantastic pot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then afterwards you could always find
good stuff too.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you know who like you were going to,
but I haven't been in the dog's age now,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I would love to go back and see if I
could find Tony or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause yeah, he had some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key is to knowing someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise you're just going to end up with
some rubbish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps it's another unselected rubbishy
sort of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they said, when I spoke with
them a little bit about it, that it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: from the tourists, you know, that they
just want to make some money out of their
[SPEAKER_00]: rubbish or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're probably going to have to
get you both back on to do another one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause there's like, we barely even got to
half the stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got like all the full amount of
stuff to get to as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know there's one question.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll probably let H&L wrap on it that we
wanted to touch on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mate, Ozzie Stanley, who was bare from the
Grateful Dead is the sound engineer built
[SPEAKER_07]: like no other walls sound and that he
lived up by like that Cedar Bay commune.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you have much to do with him?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that would have been my,
my, my, my place Cedar Bay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he's, but he lived in,
out here at the Walsh river bare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently there was going to be a mini
ice age and that was the fucking the place
[SPEAKER_00]: to be or some, some shit and something
about no earthquakes were going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all the young people, like
particularly my son, they all got stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: into his acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were like doing my weed and my
hash and Owsley's acid at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said to the boy, you guys are
spoiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like no one gets that shit anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're you, you young fucking like
they're just teenagers, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're into this liquid acid on
fucking on, on sugar cubes and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a, they did pretty well for,
they're like a younger version of older
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, some of the, you know, they lived a
life that, that you couldn't live anymore,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially at that time, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lucky fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has a bit of a strange fella,
that guy I saw him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never really knew him, but I saw him at,
he's at Mitre 10 all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like a little fella.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not a big man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just a little bloke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember looking at him and
thinking, this dude's like on something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, he's looking at me like, and I could
see the look in his face and he's thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: the same about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that was, that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: He died in a car accident here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking ran off the road.
Aquaplaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like aquaplanned and his,
he had several wives.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lived in those little communes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, he's a couple of wives
and, and the wives like just like move
[SPEAKER_00]: next door, build a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets another wife or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is his original wife.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did she come over with him?
[SPEAKER_07]: Did his original wife come over with him?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I think she was the chemist.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, she did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the lady making the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, she, and she's still alive as
far as I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's the, yeah, she was the original
one, but then he had some other,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, just out the back here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got offered to buy all this stuff
after he died.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went out there to check it all out,
to get it out of there, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the ex-wife, she kind of like
wanted a fair bit or the widow or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she never mentioned she had fucking
litres of acid, but I probably would have
[SPEAKER_00]: grabbed those because they're probably
easier to understand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: As I said, H&L, we've got to get fishing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me, Denali, go visit Wally.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Catch some barra and see if we can find
Elsie's Mrs. Yeah, that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I has been wanting to head over to
Australia too, like super bad.
