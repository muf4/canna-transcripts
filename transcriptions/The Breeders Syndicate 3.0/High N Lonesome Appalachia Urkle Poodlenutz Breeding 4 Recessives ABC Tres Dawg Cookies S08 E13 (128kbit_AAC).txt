[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_02]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_02]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_02]: seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_02]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The syndicate is a collection of seed
makers that want to push back against all
[SPEAKER_02]: the smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_02]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matt here with Thousandfold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today we're going to have our buddy,
High and Lonesome, back for a more
[SPEAKER_02]: expansive, more solo type gig.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really stoked to have him here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Thousand is as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to do this for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it's probably one of our most
requested episodes to go back and recover.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for being with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thousand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think today we're just following a
loose linear chronological structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we start at the start.
[SPEAKER_04]: High and Lonesome, what were your first
few interactions with the plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you get into that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got into it pretty young.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a teenager, we would get Mexican
brickweeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was all that was available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have family doing it,
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always pretty poor quality,
but it was loaded with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from a farming family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I naturally planted seeds pretty much
initially, probably within the first year
[SPEAKER_00]: of smoking, I started trying to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hit or miss, but I think I had my
first harvest when I was about 17 years
[SPEAKER_00]: old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up to Mexican bag seed,
got a quarter pound of weed, and I was big
[SPEAKER_00]: dick and all over high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the coolest dude I knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that weed like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, Mexican back then,
it was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would get weed that was dried like
shit, wasn't cured, cured in a tire
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing the border.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: God awful quality in the finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'd plant the seeds and you'd get
interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with a lot of the Mexican bag
seed is that it would have intersect
[SPEAKER_00]: issues outside even.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was just part of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I grew, it was lightly
seeded, and then the next year it was
[SPEAKER_00]: lightly seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd occasionally come across some plants
that didn't have any intersect issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then, you couldn't find seeds without
ordering them from Amsterdam, which seemed
[SPEAKER_00]: very sketchy at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty early on, I was trying to select
four plants that I could grow and have
[SPEAKER_00]: since EMEA.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of the resources that you had and
in terms of information, how much did you
[SPEAKER_04]: know about the plant at that point?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know immediately to look out for
males, that kind of thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I had a little bit of stone or
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: From people that had tried to grow,
I did have people in my family that grew,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I was a little young for anybody to
really share information with me or take
[SPEAKER_00]: me under their wing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a baseline and luckily I was trying
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to worry about time,
light cycles and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just let it do its thing and tried to
finish it outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: How cool were your parents with you doing
all this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not cool, but when I was a teenager,
they had a messy split up, so it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: I could get away with a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it was at that age for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started with gorilla growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really do anything outdoor until
I moved out or didn't do anything indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: until I moved out right when I was able
to, 18 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get an apartment so that I
could blow it up and grow indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the reason you wanted to move out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not like to get drunk with your buddies?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that was my number one motivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You knew what you wanted to do for a
career.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I knew pretty early on what I wanted
to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you tell us a little bit about what
some of those gorilla growers were like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Early on, it was pretty much just I'd get
some dry amendments back then,
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that was readily available,
chicken shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I would lime it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd get blood meal, bone meal,
kelp meal, all that stuff, anything I
[SPEAKER_00]: could get at the feed store without having
to go to the city, to the hydra store,
[SPEAKER_00]: and being sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take a couple 15-gallon planters
that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would dig holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, I'd try to do at least 30-gallon
holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get all the soil out, have a tarp,
mix it up with dry amendments,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't add anything for aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't really know anything about that,
but I knew that I needed very fertile soil
[SPEAKER_00]: to make anything happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use the native soil and just add
dry amendments until I thought it was good
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always tried because I wasn't one to run
any irrigation or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of my growing grows over the years,
I've tried to do in areas where I had easy
[SPEAKER_00]: access to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Near a river, near a pond, near a lake,
something like that because I always toed
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was whatever would be the least work
while being somewhat discreet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never really thought much about the
guerrilla growing aspect and not wanting
[SPEAKER_02]: to go to hydra stores in a lot of outlaw
states, but it would make sense why you
[SPEAKER_02]: would have grown up learning the organic
amendments and all that stuff versus
[SPEAKER_02]: having to go risk your ash or your face at
a hydra store, take multiple cars on your
[SPEAKER_02]: way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was what was available at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could get miracle grow or I could get
dry amendments and do it like I was trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow a badass tomato plant around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people grow tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My family did that growing up and it was
kind of a similar technique that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you prefer cherry tomatoes or heirloom
big beefy ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I have so many fucking tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably like a cherry tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm doing a BLT, I got to have a big
snake tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, you talk about moving out.
[SPEAKER_04]: How quickly did you get your hands on
other kinds of genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first couple of times I tried to get
seeds, I dealt with seed banks that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I dealt with with Mark Emery pretty
early on, sent money to Canada with a hope
[SPEAKER_00]: and a dream and didn't get shit and had a
kind of follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really start getting anything
until I went to the Dutch or the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get stuff that was reasonably cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nirvana, Casey Brains, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of Sensei, but ordering it
through Seeds Direct or one of those guys
[SPEAKER_00]: in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really start with that until I
moved out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was about when I found Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of had a little bit more knowledge
as to what I wanted, what I could finish,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd get cheaper stuff like Nirvana and
Casey Brains for my outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was going to do some stuff inside
where I could back up plants, I would
[SPEAKER_00]: splurge a little bit and get a cheap pack
of Sensei seeds or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Casey Brains for the outdoor win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that stuff was solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I still had some.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, I wanted to ask you about that
too, because Matt does have a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: questions for you about the forums.
[SPEAKER_04]: But before that, I did want to ask,
out of these early packs, what were some
[SPEAKER_04]: of the highlights that you remember?
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked the Casey 30 6 a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That did really well outdoor here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking back on it, it was all very
Dutchified.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the Nirvana stuff seemed like it was a
skunk one cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their Durban Poison, I did a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their White Rhino, I grew a bit indoor and
really liked that for the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor didn't do much for me with
White Rhino, White Widow, any of those
[SPEAKER_00]: whites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the potency was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, the first seeds that I grew and I
really was head over heels for them were
[SPEAKER_00]: some free seeds I got from Evergrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy, JLP, that would give away
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew a bunch of his lines over the
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just be an active member, send him a
message, and he'd send you some free
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a couple lines I grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Romeo and Juliet was one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had one called Phoenix Haze that was
like a Neville's Haze, Super Silver Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was real good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was in the Afro Pips Senegal
Haze at the Phoenix Haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was an awesome plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty heavy on the Neville's Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was something like Dutch Grown
got busted and the seeds were collected
[SPEAKER_00]: and so there were either Neville's Haze or
Neville's Cross to Super Silver Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: He inbred it from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some phenomenal plants in
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Petimore, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: JLP?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Lee Petimore.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the forums, did you already get the
name Hein Lanser?
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you come to that name?
[SPEAKER_00]: That name, I didn't use it on Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't as active on Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of pretty sketched out by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a different handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when that went down, I kind of freaked
out for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought everybody's getting busted and
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I signed up for ICMAG,
I was really into bluegrass music at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Highlands of Sound, that's the way
people described the sound of the Stanley
[SPEAKER_00]: Brothers, which is a first generation
bluegrass band from Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a play on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I chose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In retrospect, I probably could have come
up with something cooler, but that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: I got.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I like that one a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good story too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget that bluegrass culture,
a lot of it stems from Virginia in that
[SPEAKER_02]: Eastern area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's Southwest Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kentucky is the bluegrass state.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it kind of all started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kentucky, Tennessee, Southwest Virginia,
North Carolina, all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, did you want to ask about the
forums?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other early forums that you
can think of that were kind of influential
[SPEAKER_02]: in your growing experience or online
learning experience that we haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only other one I would say of great
significance to me would be Mechanica
[SPEAKER_00]: Banna, which people that were getting
frequently banned from ICMAG kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: started going over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a bunch of friends from the forums
that were over there and they kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: turned me onto it, but that was a smaller
forum, but a ton of knowledge there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have nearly as many 17-year-old
kids showing up trying to find weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was growers discussing the real deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was pretty big for me for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there were quite a few other smaller
ones that I was on, but Mechanica Banna is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely the only one other than ICMAG
that was a major influence on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to D-Man.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how much you want to go into
this part and it's up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can write it down if not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote down early friends and allies on
the forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: Early friends, people you met that were
influential to your whatever at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody stands out early on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I had quite a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple of local guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how active they are nowadays
and I don't know if they would want me
[SPEAKER_00]: saying their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met a local guy who went by Stretch
Puppy on the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We became pretty close.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shared a lot of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both learned quite a bit from each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hung out a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a bit north of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew some really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shared a ton of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was blowing it up back then in an area
where I probably wouldn't have.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's gangster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the first guy who showed me the
Fairfax Four-Way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was getting bags of it, but he couldn't
get cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was held down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know the right people.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually bought some packs of the
Nirvana Four-Way and he popped a pack and
[SPEAKER_00]: he found a dead ringer of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a phenomenal plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very similar to some of that rubber
city stuff from Pitt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way the heads developed on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a hell of a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had 10 packs of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then it was like, oh, it's just
Nirvana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll buy the real thing and see if I
really want to find a keeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll always be around forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's not available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've reached out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned the Fairfax Four-Way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know since you mentioned it,
a lot of people are going to be watching
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to be VA boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any recollections of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or remembrances of how it was back then?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was in the era where most
commercially available stuff was Beasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stood out because it was locally grown,
high quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would imagine so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today it would probably be really cool for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd really get into it, but it doesn't
seem like something that would be in a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a modern thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last I heard they were cleaning the cut
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder where it's at.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be through that status now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be cool to see.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Post HPLV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the trip down memory lane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to connect you guys anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dude from Virginia as well is pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's pretty legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say about that same time,
how we would see some other stuff from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern part of Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since Eastar, I remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being devastatingly potent the first
time I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around that time, started seeing sour
diesel show up and that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Virginia?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour diesel in Virginia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of stuff came down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really that far from New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain markets like the DC area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then, an ounce of sour diesel was
$600.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very marketable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That started showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked it and was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, I had made some friends through
the forums that I could source to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell in love with that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet that's a game changer, especially
for the era and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still smoke it all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something that I wanted to ask
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit of a tangent,
but it's in the same realm.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the other old Virginia
clones you can think of that you'd like to
[SPEAKER_02]: nod to?
[SPEAKER_02]: In this episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't out West.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very small circles of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't a ton of trading.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd see the Gany from Virginia Beach
sometimes, which there were other Gany's
[SPEAKER_00]: in the state that people were growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one in Southwest Virginia that
was incredible, but you would see stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was mostly cuts of seed lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't stuff with mysterious origins
and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a Durban poison cut in my area
for a while, but mostly the cut game
[SPEAKER_00]: started happening around the time that the
price gouging was going on in Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday's a little train wreck,
that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was going for insane money,
so people started growing that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: locally and cashing in pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even imagine seeing train wreck
over there for the first time because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: so vastly different than a lot of the
wheat over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that hit the area, it had been on top
for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was mostly import from Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: The joke was always what doesn't sell in
California gets shipped east.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality wasn't there, but it was
unmistakably a train wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that's grown it could see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, if you had a jar of really nice
well-grown indoor train wreck and you
[SPEAKER_00]: cracked that, you would fucking blow
people's minds back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I bet, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was also in that era, you had to
watch who you pulled that shit out around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't go to a party and open a jar
of sourdise or a train wreck because then
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody would be like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did you get this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool guy to mark real fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like when you're going out to a
party or hanging out with some friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: you grab a bag of shitty weed that you
bought off somebody just to keep a low
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't even flash a good shit in front
of the chicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, you could, but... Just not
in front of everyone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you had to be reserved to
make it through the drug war.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: With great power comes great
responsibility, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chicks are always the first way dudes get
caught anyways, now that I think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, you had a note here about the
infamous Chem 101 thread on IC Race.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can we talk about some of your first
experiences with even hearing of Chem,
[SPEAKER_02]: what started that journey into trying to
track down the history?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if people aren't aware,
some of my first intros into reading on
[SPEAKER_02]: the forums about like digging into a
history was like the Chem 101 thread for
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty important in my learning
and overall how we ended up here at this
[SPEAKER_02]: point overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what puts you on that journey?
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that time, you know, I had sour
diesel, which there were various theories
[SPEAKER_00]: floating around about how that was related
to ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a, you know, ChemDog bag seed cross
that I was growing that was, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty, pretty close to, you know,
what a lot of people know is like a ChemD
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was trying even pretty much from the
jump with ChemDog online, there was a ton
[SPEAKER_00]: of misinformation, a ton of people trying
to, you know, get credit for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I started trying to compile what
information was available, talk to the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that were closest to, you know,
to the whole thing, the Chem Fam guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it would be called now and try to
get kind of a straightforward,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just a breakdown of the family
and, and how it was all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was, you know, I was looking at this
shit, researching it, talking to people
[SPEAKER_00]: every night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, shit, you know,
if I'm doing all this, I might as well put
[SPEAKER_00]: it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next guy that wants to know what
the fuck's going on, can look it up and
[SPEAKER_00]: figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after talking to various people,
you know, at the time on the forum,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could talk to Joe Brand, you could
talk to P-Bud, ChemDog, Greg was on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else?
[SPEAKER_00]: JJ was on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of people that were, you know,
relevant in that world were there to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to discuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I basically took the information as
best I could and, and put it together,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, looking back on it, there are
definitely some flaws in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the time it was the information
that was available as well as I could
[SPEAKER_00]: present it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's like, it really is still the
best information as any anybody could
[SPEAKER_02]: present it as given by the people who told
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's accurate to that, to that extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's probably the most
important part, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was, it was a cool thread.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I talked to Inspector a bunch
about it and I remember when I posted it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he came on and I think his first
post on the thread was, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're going to talk about Kim 91,
you ought to have a picture of the real
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he posted a picture because the
picture that I had used was from Joe,
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe Brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't, it wasn't Kim 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that time, at that time I had no
experience with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still a very tightly held cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, A for effort, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, and Joe Brand was the source
of the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like him posting a picture of Kim 91,
you would assume it would be a great
[SPEAKER_02]: source for the picture, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, at that time that was,
yeah, that's straight from the horse's
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I, it's always fascinated me to know
what puts you on that journey because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's a lot of how we ended up like
even here at this point, discussing this
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of stuff together now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and it's still up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For someone to come in like me in what?
[SPEAKER_04]: 2019, 2020 and to go and look at that
thread is still really remarkable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the number of like people who are now
very notable figures in the community that
[SPEAKER_04]: were in that participating like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an artifact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was a, it was a smaller world
back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's still the best place to go look
at all the pictures is like the one
[SPEAKER_02]: through four too, which is still hard to
find pictures of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywhere at least the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was, yeah, that was right after
inspected had run them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he had pictures that he let me use
for the thread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was, it was pretty
remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still kind of bummed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never got to try the two and the three,
but you know, what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: The two, the two is always interested me
because it's, it's bud structure being so
[SPEAKER_02]: uniquely different than all of them,
you know, little tiny budlets as opposed
[SPEAKER_02]: to everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just always seemed more unique than the
rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I remember, uh, inspected did he
crossed them all to deep chunk and chrome,
[SPEAKER_00]: chrome ran out the Kim to deep junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a plant in there that was
like strikingly similar to Kim 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, yeah, it, it, at least
visually, and that kind of always,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I just, I've always thought
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wish you could have gotten those to pop.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this a good, is this a good time for us
to also ask you about what you might
[SPEAKER_04]: consider your first breeding projects,
like actual breeding projects?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that happen in a similar time to the
thread?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, you know, really, I've always
kind of done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I've messed with breeding different
Mexicans trying to get away from
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphroditic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, pretty much the second year I was
growing, it was something that I always
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of messed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I found a male that seems solid,
I would, I would save it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I never had any intentions in,
into really getting into breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always just kind of, kind of
something that came with the territory for
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody that was obsessed with,
with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and really the, the first thing of
note I did was, um, you know, this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: with trace dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I passed it to some friends that I
traded seeds with back then, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cody and I talked a lot on the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were several, several other people,
40 grid, um, you know, a bunch of guys
[SPEAKER_00]: that I, I would just swap some seeds with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, bullshit along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that was the first, um,
the first thing of note that I ever did
[SPEAKER_00]: before that, it was mostly just kind of,
um, you know, I'm going to cross this
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican to this Phoenix Hayes or I'm going
to cross this Mexican to this other one
[SPEAKER_00]: and try to get rid of the hermaphrodite,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, I would say that's the
first thing of note that I, I really did.
[SPEAKER_02]: What all did you do with the trade off or
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, trade off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so at that time I had a pretty good,
um, stable cuts and I was growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, growing those seeds from JJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he and I had traded some stuff and I
had some of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing some of his, um,
Nigerian silk back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing a few, a few different
things at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I found a male in trace dog that
I was really impressed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was impressed with, you know,
the structure of it, the vigor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, um, you know, he can be kind of
floppy, um, but it was, had a really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: rigid structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so I kept it and, um, there were a
number of plants that I really liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were missing certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I basically just hit, you know,
hit some plants with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit purple oracle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit, um, the Kim D and Kim four that I
had, I hit, um, abusive Oji Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an Acapulco gold that I hit,
um, just kind of a mix, a mixture of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, pretty much gave all the seeds
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept a few for myself, but, um,
mostly it was just, you know, just giving
[SPEAKER_00]: them to my friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for clarity here, what is the trace
dog?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a Kim dog D, um, BX two to JJ NYC
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I'm not sure if it was,
I don't know if the original seed line was
[SPEAKER_00]: released, um, cause this was before top
dog launched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not sure if he, I know he released
an in-cross of it later, but I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: when he, um, you know, started his
company, it was, uh, star dog is what kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of launched, launched the Kim lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what mail did he use for the trends?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a, since he sees anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was out cross.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he used the Afghan one and then,
uh, and then rest pretty much copied them
[SPEAKER_00]: and used the sensei Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but JJ was the first one to have a
Chimtee type seed line.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that like going back,
I got to give them props on knowing to use
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani one or, or, or type of plant like
that to back cross or to using a back
[SPEAKER_02]: cross like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, looking back at how many
people have made epic fails at that
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's actually probably a pretty
good choice to use in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, um, he did a great job with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I had that male plant that I
kept for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had a, um, a female from it
that was phenomenal as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, um, it was like a,
it had the Kim deep potency, but it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit creamier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, it, it's most reminiscent to me
of like, if you grow Kim D outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, it's still, it's still really funky,
but it has this kind of sweet creaminess
[SPEAKER_00]: to it, especially as it starts to cure,
cure a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that, that came through pretty
strong on the trace dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, it was, it was a great line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, um, I hit it to a bunch of stuff and,
uh, yeah, some of it got kind of popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dogs waltz, uh, notably the poodle
nuts cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that was found by 40 grit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 grit, 40 ounce grown on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a bunch of names, um, on the
forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, so he was, um, a good buddy of mine
that I met through, yeah, either overgrow
[SPEAKER_00]: or IC mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, he was like the first dude that
was like blowing up warehouses and posting
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was growing, you know, a warehouse of
Urkel in the Bay area and just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, crushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: His, his Oracle was the best that I ever
smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he just nailed it, but you know,
he was always looking for, for something
[SPEAKER_00]: that grew faster because, you know,
if you're doing lights and lights of
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel, you know, your veg time is for
fucking ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so when I was, um, you know,
when I was making this seeds, I had an
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel and I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pollinate that one just for,
just for my boy 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I sent him a bunch of seeds and he
popped them and, um, yeah, he found that
[SPEAKER_00]: cut that he called the poodle nuts and,
uh, it still floats around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, I remember my first encounter with
that was with, uh, a bunch of the Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed it getting really big in Denver
when the Denver medical team came on
[SPEAKER_02]: board.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know, um, what's his name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Tiero Rojo, Phil Phil Tiero Rojo.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was blowing it up with that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when I was like, God,
what is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it was super unique looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, to me it's, uh, and you'll
probably hate that I say this,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it reminds me of like something as
unique in different looking as cookies
[SPEAKER_02]: would have been at the same time,
like looking at them, how different they
[SPEAKER_02]: both look from normal standard,
but around it could have easily caught on
[SPEAKER_02]: the hype of that in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, like it was almost going in
that direction in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just never quite got the cookie smash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were, there were several guys in
Denver that grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still has, um, still has a pretty good
reputation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually, um, I went to a dispensary
here a year or two ago, and, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I was meeting a friend that ran the
dispensary and he was telling the people
[SPEAKER_00]: in the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is the guy that did dogs
waltz and they were all like, Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was like, damn man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got two questions here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to be clear that the dogs waltz is
Urkel by Tresdog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And would this be, would you consider this
the moment where you were starting to get
[SPEAKER_04]: exposure for the first time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, I wouldn't say that because it was
still, you know, it was, it was just forum
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like it was, um, it wasn't like
it was winning a cup or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, the people that I
already knew and respected saw that I made
[SPEAKER_00]: something that was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was more like, it was more like just
getting, getting the respect of my peers
[SPEAKER_00]: and people that I looked up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, the moment that I kind of,
I guess, became infamous in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabis world was, um,
when 30 started using the Appalachia
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it time for us to talk about the
Appalachia?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even the name, I mean,
we might be one thing before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you can correct me if I'm wrong,
but the skunk magazine, sub cool,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, retraction, was that probably
Appalachia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, when he published the Kim 101 in
skunk magazine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, um, that was kind of wild to me
because, you know, at the time I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: a dude that had a couple of lights in his
house and did some gorilla grows and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just some dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd go to the bookstore and pick up
the weed magazines every once in a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, I wasn't getting that
shit in the mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I picked it up one day and started
reading it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, God damn, this is word for
word, my thread for my CMAG.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I, I wasn't the biggest fan
of him anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it kind of rubbed me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I, I remember looking up the email
for them and I emailed them and linked
[SPEAKER_00]: them to the thread and they were of
course, super apologetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, we're going to dock
him on the next article and we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: send you the amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, it was something ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like more, uh, it was more for just
getting it corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they sent me a check for like 70
bucks or something that I never cashed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was more for like, you know,
peace of mind, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't frame that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was just thinking,
I don't know whatever happened to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, probably should have.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd effect to find if you have,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea what that would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there is another one that,
that I know CSI would want me to bring up
[SPEAKER_02]: before we move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that before Appalachia and
that's the infamous ICMAG banning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of high and lonesome where like everybody
kind of decided that they were going to
[SPEAKER_02]: start pulling their threads and shit
because they banned you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I got bans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might've been in the Kim 101 thread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but basically it was having a bit of a
back and forth with old res dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, you know, this wasn't easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even, you know, this was pretty government
informant rest dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was just, you know, he's a,
he's a giant asshole.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, you know, I had a couple of back
and forths with him on the forums and that
[SPEAKER_00]: was, you know, Jesse Nirvana is number one
cash cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically if you talk shit to him,
you got yanked and he was just an arrogant
[SPEAKER_00]: prick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as I can tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: He still is, but you know, now he's also a
confirmed rat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I, I would get banned again
over that shit, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the rest of the story goes that
everybody else on not everybody,
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously, but a bunch of the respected
guys on ICMAG, including CSI who had,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, hundreds and hundreds of pages
of amazing grows up there just started
[SPEAKER_02]: deleting them.
[SPEAKER_02]: To try to get you back and it worked
eventually, didn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no, I had to, I waited a while and
then I was like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to sign back up and I signed
back up and they banned me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I, I eventually did it again,
just to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I still currently have an
account there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I never, never used it, but they
always got me bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: They always got me, but I always had riot
in the name somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it was, it was a marketing
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was how he sold seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you fucked with this money,
you were gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tended to be most of the,
the, the way with forums though,
[SPEAKER_02]: like most forums seem to have some sort of
seed bank eventually connected to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, they had their top
dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you messed with that, then there
was an issue here almost always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, and that's the reason a lot of
people like CSI and myself, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: many others kind of went to the Kana
Kavana because it was, it wasn't a,
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't a seed banks forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could kind of discuss what you wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just without a lot of the politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Command is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think now we can head in if you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I did have one last thing on forums,
which is in 2023, are there forums that
[SPEAKER_04]: are still relevant in like to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's good information on IC mag
still it's, um, it's difficult because as
[SPEAKER_00]: people got banned, a couple of things
would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they would either have their posts
left up without their name on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just says yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, uh, when some of those older
threads, you don't really know whose
[SPEAKER_00]: comments you're reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know whether to put a lot of
weight into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they, they, there is a good amount of
relevant information there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, it's a bit antiquated at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of, you know, a lot of guys
that are doing shit in illegal States
[SPEAKER_00]: wiring up, you know, a couple,
250 watt HPS lights or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of, you know, as a home grower,
I think it has a lot, a lot of good
[SPEAKER_00]: material, but if you're, um, if you're
doing anything big, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: antiquated.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't, I haven't checked out a lot of
the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, mechanic command is still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know like roll it up is still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't, I've, I went on there to,
um, follow a thread, uh, where somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: was growing some of my stuff and it was
pretty cool, but you know, I'm not active
[SPEAKER_00]: on any of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I don't have a ton of extra time like I
did when I was younger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think we can segue now to the
Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so from the time that you first made
the cross, like how long has it been?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was 2007 when I made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has been what 16 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you know, for me, yeah,
a lot of people are really excited about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but for me, it's like, it's something
that I made and I've pretty much grown it
[SPEAKER_00]: ever since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it does really well in multiple
applications for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something, you know, does well
outside does well enough greenhouse does
[SPEAKER_00]: well indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've kind of always, always done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I'll usually make seeds with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them just kind of hang out in my
fridge until I toss them or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, it's, it's an older line,
but it's, it's a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to ask you about, um, maybe what
you perceive to be the different stages
[SPEAKER_04]: that projects been through.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just before that, um, I want to ask
about the name, you know, why did you call
[SPEAKER_04]: it Appalachia?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you already talked about how high
and lonesome is drawn from bluegrass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, Appalachia, tell us about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, really it was because I was hoping to
find something that was, um, a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: solid for what I wanted outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a time I was doing my outdoor
grows in that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was kind of hoping for something that
was regionally appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of the stuff that was popular on
the West coast and popular in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Spain or places like that didn't
really cross over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a different climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot more humidity, um,
earlier frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the stuff that was marketed
for outdoor wasn't really well suited to
[SPEAKER_00]: the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of just, uh, called it
Appalachia because green crack was one
[SPEAKER_00]: that I grew a lot outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I was hoping to improve it with
the trace dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, green crack has some issues outside
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let it go to where I like it,
you know, it's, it, it likes to rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a very fast plant though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get away with it by,
by taking it early.
[SPEAKER_00]: It triggers pretty early here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you can get it eight weeks without
any issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take it 10 weeks and man,
if you leave it out, out here that long,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, you know, it's, you're losing half
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you, um, first for like an indoor
idiot like me, can you explain what
[SPEAKER_02]: triggers early means?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know it took many years to figure
out what that even meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you know, after the solstice,
the days start to get shorter and shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, most stuff outdoor doesn't wait until
it's actual daylight equivalent to flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it did that, everything would flip in
September here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, as the days, as the days get
shorter and shorter, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some stuff will start flowering at.
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 hours of daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some stuff will start flowering at 13
hours of daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you have it, if you have it
where it only gets morning sun,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might trigger a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's always been, especially with
messing with different cuts outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there was some stuff that was
amazing indoor, but you take it out door
[SPEAKER_00]: and it triggers into August and you can't
finish it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, green crack triggers pretty early,
um, consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was, it was a good candidate to work
with for my seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we liked it outdoors in San Diego a
lot too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, most of my whole outdoor experience
was green crack and KC brains and green
[SPEAKER_02]: crack for the most part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are some of your initial
considerations when you made the cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, would you be able to take us through
the journey of like where Appalachia has
[SPEAKER_04]: been from, you know, um, from the early
days, uh, with Bodhi and to where it is
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gave it to Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really know, um, what all had
come of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of took a break from, um,
the forums in the late 2000s, maybe 2008,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a couple years off from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just kind of sick of the politics
sick of, you know, the big Dickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I, I, I didn't really know what was
going on with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, I was growing it outside every
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a couple cuts that I grew inside,
but outdoor I would usually make a few
[SPEAKER_00]: seats with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, basically, uh, kind of uneducated or
not uneducated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wasn't ever something that I
intended for, you know, a broad audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was one-to-one breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd find a male I like, see the lowers on
a female I liked and keep the seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, around, I don't know, 2000,
I don't know early 2010s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Matt was actually on IC mag and sent
me a message, um, saying that Ken had won
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis cup with a renamed Appalachia
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I, I'd logged on just to,
you know, answering my messages and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: up with the few people I didn't want to
lose contact with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw that and, you know, I hit up
Bodhi about it and we talked about it and
[SPEAKER_00]: he was like, Oh man, you know,
I didn't want to drag you into the drama.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but he filled me in on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, it, the word got out
that it was, um, Bodhi's keeper female
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachia cut that won the cannabis cup
as Bay 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and around that same time,
um, Bodhi had made, you know, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses with it and, uh, it was,
it was starting to take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when it was, um, you know,
that's when it was kind of a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was a ton of demand for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I had some seeds that I was
working with, but not a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, I think I originally released
the line as an F three around 2012 through
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed Depot, um, which was,
you know, a European seed bank that was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to stand up until it wasn't.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I released, yeah, I released those
and, um, the sour diesel Appalachia cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so at which point with the,
Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to ask with the F three.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, how were you selecting towards that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so at that time I was looking for
basically what I'm looking for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, um, green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite thing about it is the flavor,
the candied mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let it go 70 days, but if you take
it, when it looks done around eight weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's not, I mean, it's not that
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you, if you take a 70,
it's a nice buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good all time day smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it doesn't, you know, it doesn't
pack a punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a pretty low ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the flavor is, I mean,
you just want to smoke it constantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, my goal with that one
has always been try to get some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mango flavor with the potency,
um, which, you know, it's hard to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that's, that was the goal then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's, you know, I don't know how
many of those packs got sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, you know, they shut down a few
months after I started dealing with them
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of screwed all the breeders,
but, um, yeah, but that was, that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: goal then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, after I, you know, took my
lickings there, I just kind of gave up on
[SPEAKER_00]: any kind of ideas with the seed game
because it was too sketchy dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: people in Europe and all of that jazz.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, is it worth talking about the
difference between you working on it then
[SPEAKER_04]: and your recent releases of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, working on it then I made
those F threes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't use a huge pool, um, to select
from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the F twos, you know, it was from
maybe 15 seeds, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and once I got to F three,
there were some plants I liked,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when I made F force with it,
it, it lost the mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mango was pretty much gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, there was a higher
percentage of, of bland, highly resinous
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, the resin from green crack came
through, but it lost the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resident of it came through and then
the potency of the trace dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I couldn't, I couldn't get that
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I took it to F five, um,
see if I could, you know, find some,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was, you know, more of the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it remained a very vigorous,
highly resinous plant with, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, still a good little range to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some good highs in there, but it
didn't have the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, after years of people
asking about it and Matt kind of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: on me to make some more, I, um,
I went back to the F twos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I popped 50 of them and, um, I found,
um, you know, several plants that I really
[SPEAKER_00]: liked in F twos.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were, there's a good bit of mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some, some with, you know,
mango and fuel kind of interplaying and in
[SPEAKER_00]: a unique way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so to avoid bottlenecking it,
I, I used a couple of males and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, all of my favorite females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I grew the females out separately,
smoked on them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that were really impressive
that had what I thought I wanted in the
[SPEAKER_00]: line, those are the ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, um, I hardest to see from,
and that's what I released.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, did you make a conscious decision
about whether to do one-to-one as opposed
[SPEAKER_04]: to like a group?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I, yeah, I did make that decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially I was doing one-to-one
breeding and I think that works really
[SPEAKER_00]: well for certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, the thing with Appalachia at the
time, you know, was some people wanted it
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people wanted it for hobbyist
breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and a lot of people had a kind of
different, um, impression of what the line
[SPEAKER_00]: should be based on Bode's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bode had, um, a male that brought a lot of
creaminess, um, you know, like a creamy
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim sweetness, um, to the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't want to completely deviate
from that because that's what a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people, you know, fell in love with,
with the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I wanted it to keep, I wanted to
keep it open so that there would be,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, a decent variety for people to look
through.
Um.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I heard there, what I heard there
basically is that the world owes me a
[SPEAKER_02]: favor for getting you to release seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically it's all me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely didn't want to get into two
guys, one cups, but just before that,
[SPEAKER_04]: on either side of the Appalachia,
like in this whole journey, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: were there other notable projects,
um, that you'd like to highlight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a lot of kind of like private
stuff for my own curiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, I've done a lot of things that I'm
either not pleased with or they,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never gotten around to testing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, I have a lot of crosses I've done,
but I never really had the mindset,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, to release them commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, I have a good amount of stuff
that I'm kind of digging back through now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but no, nothing noteworthy that would
mean anything to anybody except me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the pickiest person I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy how much stuff he's made or
like I've talked about in the past,
[SPEAKER_02]: like gone through several generations and
then been like, nah, I'll go back like
[SPEAKER_02]: three steps and then start there again and
go back through.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tedious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's amazing to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's just not often done,
you know, because it is so much work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, um, you know, like I have a,
um, TMD backcross that I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that's not, it's not something
that's ready for any kind of ready for me
[SPEAKER_00]: to let out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, you know, I recently did some more
sativa kind of stuff, but it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, jury's still out on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to, I got to approve of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, um, we can come back to some of
your, you know, current more recent
[SPEAKER_04]: experiments and your B-sides.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but maybe we can't talk about two
guys, one cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that, that was all, I mean,
it pretty much stemmed from a joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, uh, me and Matt were talking about,
you know, winning cups and not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: credit for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the genetics were either renamed or,
you know, just not called out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, man, we need to,
we need to start a company and call it,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, two guys, one cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I spelled it like, you know,
the, the infamous two girls, one,
[SPEAKER_00]: two girls, one cup video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and really it's, um, from a marketing
and branding standpoint, it's a terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like probably one of the worst,
um, worst things ever, but it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was, um, it was just something we were
fucking around with for fun, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: to release kind of collaborations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we've talked, we've talked about like
rebranding and maybe doing it seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, but there's some cool stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was such a good name, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't people appreciate like triple
entendre?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super witty.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what were your, what were both of your
favorites to come out of that collab?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we only did two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's two, there was the,
um, the poodle nuts loop on it and then
[SPEAKER_02]: the lupus headband Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would, that comprises the total of
two guys, one cups.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, how does, how does poodle nuts
relate to dogs walks?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cut of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the, it's the cut that, uh,
40 grit sound that was kind of how it
[SPEAKER_00]: became popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, that's, that's the extent of
that, that work thus far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe, maybe under new different
names, new different masters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't know where this one fits in
high and lonesome, but we, you and I
[SPEAKER_04]: talked about, um, you talking about
breeding for recessives.
[SPEAKER_04]: So where did that appear?
[SPEAKER_04]: In your timeline?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, I mean, that's kind of,
that was kind of like something I dealt
[SPEAKER_00]: with from the jump, um, in trying to breed
a Mexican plant that didn't have,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, hermaphroditic traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, um, I would, I was pretty,
I've always kind of been a geek about all
[SPEAKER_00]: this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I used to get, um, bags of Mexican
weed, I would save the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, um, label them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a system I made up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty like over the top,
really thinking back on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I would have some notes on it,
some notes on, you know, the quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: the high from the plants, the physical
appearance, appearance without being too
[SPEAKER_00]: harsh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, like I said, that stuff
was all treated like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I would, you know, I would ask for
origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I couldn't get it,
but you know, sometimes it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: Sinaloa or whatever, probably just
whatever the dude thought would shut me
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but it was good because I could go
back and look at, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: which ones were my favorite to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, those would be the seeds that I
popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'd also go on things like,
you know, seed maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there were a ton of white seeds in it,
I figured.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they have problems finishing it
in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty fucked for Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, so I grew one of those lines
and, um, it was, you know, it was a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional kind of Mexican sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of plants with peppery or
penaline in it, but I had one plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, it was like a straight mango and that
may like a cantaloupe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really, Melanie, um, you know,
sweet spice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a really just incredible flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the only thing I'd really seen like
that, um, in Mexican weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it, it was a full on intersect
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, you'd have clusters in
the tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have clusters everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I crossed, I crossed that to
another, um, another Mexican I had and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, the next year I grew those
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they, in the F one, there was a good
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't find anything that was quite like
that cantaloupey type plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made a few more with my favorite
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the, um, in the F three of
that plant, I found quite a few that had
[SPEAKER_00]: that cantaloupe aroma to them,
but they all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was, you know, I was trying to
breed for that recessive flavor profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in that line, that seemed to be linked
to intersects traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that was, that was my first,
um, first experience trying to breed for
[SPEAKER_00]: recessives failing at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, you know, I've had several
other instances with it over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one project and it's not even,
I mean, I guess it's a project because
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working on it for a few years,
but, um, I have been growing, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: a line from hide his subterfuge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's his, um, improved ABC line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, you know, the plants are very ABC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, you know, you can tell he's
worked it quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it takes a while to get them going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I've been kind of making seats
with it, playing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made a good amount of hybrids with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, trying to get a little more potency
out of it and trying to get away from the,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's our Penelene, which is very,
I mean, it's not, it's not like,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, it's not like train wrecked or
Penelene where it has some interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: notes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a flat, kind of one
dimensional flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so the first time I made seats with
that line, I crossed it to, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: several things that I thought could aid in
the potency and the flavor, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim D of a Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think TK, a few others, um,
and I, I popped some of those hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the Kim D ABC is the one that I've
kind of messed with the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you, uh, pop the F ones of it,
they're all normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a mutant, anything in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that, you know, you get some plants
that have the kind of ABC type,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, flavor palette and high, you know,
some stuff that just isn't really hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: on all that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, um, in the F ones, they're
completely normal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you ask to them though, uh,
when you ask to them, you'll start to see
[SPEAKER_00]: that recessive leaf pop out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you get a mix of them, but to lock
down that recessive trait, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to have to take it to an F three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's something I've been messing
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've talked to CSI about it because
he's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much more work with it than I have,
um, with the, uh, ABC line, not,
[SPEAKER_00]: not subterfuge, but same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, once you get back to
having that mutation on the leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you pretty much you're back where you
started.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can get some stuff that's a
little bit prettier or smells a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better or might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tad more potent, but you're pretty much
back in the same ball game, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: once you get to that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, um, and that's another thing,
you know, it's a, it's a recessive trait
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're trying to isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you work it to the point of
getting there, um, it seems to be linked
[SPEAKER_00]: with that kind of dull turpentine lean low
potency thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, um, it's taught me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot that that's a good line or messing
with it's like something like that or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like maybe breeding auto flowers
where you can visually see the recessives
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's been, um, it's taught me a
lot about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, uh, it's just not easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stubborn, stubborn link traits like
that are crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, do you think that's what hide was
doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know when you go back and look at
the, uh, um, the genetics and makeup of
[SPEAKER_02]: subterfuge, it's, it's like, uh,
so much in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it, I wonder if he was just going like
always moving forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, okay, I'm going to try to put Calio
in it and then, uh, it didn't really work
[SPEAKER_02]: that great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't know how he did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I've never talked to him
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I assume he probably had to do it
kind of similar to what I did or what,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, CSI is done where you have to
take it to an F3 just to get back to that
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you would really, I feel like you
would need to just.
[SPEAKER_00]: Embraid it to the point of it not being
fun to grow, to get anything else out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We, we actually have an Aussie guy who is
in our discord, a new member.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I believe he worked sort of
collaborated with Caleb or was growing a
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch of ABC in Australia, talking to
Caleb about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe he'll have interesting questions
to follow up with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think, uh, yeah, really cool to hear
an account of, um, actively looking for
[SPEAKER_04]: these recessives actually seeing like the
ratios come out in F2s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, that must've been a pretty
amazing experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, ABC was its own like wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rare cannabis hunt for a lot of us that
were like straight up dorks, I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: like not everybody even knew about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like is this kind of like niche thing that
like in the, even in the breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: community was still niche for anybody to
even know that this thing fucking existed
[SPEAKER_02]: and nobody could get their fucking mitts
on it in the U S and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's the Emory release of like that and
flow crossed and yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I had some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, when I got them, I didn't want to
pop them until I, you know, I,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was saving, saving them, hoping,
you know, I could do some reading with it
[SPEAKER_00]: or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the night you lose your virginity
and then you can pop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that never happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, they just got, uh, yeah,
I let them age out and I couldn't pop them
[SPEAKER_00]: when I went to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bummer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Such a bummer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're only, I can't remember how many
packs were released to that, but it was so
[SPEAKER_02]: limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that's what, that's what,
uh, Hodge line was based off of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that Emory dropped.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, someone finally, I, our friend
resin lung even went to Australia to try
[SPEAKER_02]: to go track down ABC, like on his own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eventually, eventually one dude,
like still kind of, I personally,
[SPEAKER_02]: my opinion is it's kind of sketch how we
came across them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still thinking that they might just be
by a hive somehow, like backdoored maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, somehow they were brought to
market eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah, I'm glad they did though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's definitely, um, something more
for like the hardcore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nerds than the people that are like trying
to grow smokeable flower to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it has, it has zero marketability,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, I mean, it just looks like Ivy
looks like Ivy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're super cool plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a bunch of your, your version of
the subterfuge going on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have bags of it that I still haven't
shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish everybody grew it even for
ornamental.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, you can grow a yard full of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows what the fuck it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I thought we could maybe wrap up
this bit on recessives and we have so many
[SPEAKER_04]: questions for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I think before we get onto some of
the more open-ended ones, um, I'd love for
[SPEAKER_04]: you to kind of, um, I suppose not
conclude, but, um, we can, we can focus a
[SPEAKER_04]: bit more on your work again, and maybe you
can talk through some of the recent
[SPEAKER_04]: releases, um, the Appalachia crosses that
you've made, um, maybe standouts,
[SPEAKER_04]: anything interesting in the process of
making those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those were all, you know, I didn't
cross everything I have in my stable to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's kind of, that's kind of the
move, but there was, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was all plants, uh, that I felt could
benefit from certain aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, old Betsy is one of my
favorite things to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's just, it's, it's like opening a
jar of grandma's jelly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just, you can't stop smelling
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, every time I open a jar, I'm like,
well, let me just smoke a little,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, but it, you know, when you're vegging
the plant, it always wants to throw
[SPEAKER_00]: pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a root bound, if you get a root
bound, it wants to start flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feed it the wrong thing,
it wants to start flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's kind of a visual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I wanted to cross it to something
so that I could kind of, I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: something similar that I could kind of you
know, go back and pull that, pull that
[SPEAKER_00]: type of plant out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that was, that was a pretty successful
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I really liked the way that that
came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask you, could you use that trigger
that, that, that pre-flowering trait as a
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial thing for outdoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, outdoor, it doesn't seem to do it the
way that I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in full sun, it, it's a little bit
more, um, it's a little bit more vigorous
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I normally grow in pretty large pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, it doesn't have that issue where
like, if it hits, you know, if it hits the
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the pot, it gets pissed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes a lot more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Continue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I did that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the shoreline is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke it daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's an incredible plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an absolute beast outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for my climate of all the cuts that
I've grown outside, it, uh, performs the
[SPEAKER_00]: best, uh, yield wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very, um, rock resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take it through some shit in the
fall and it's, um, it comes out fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: When everything else is kind of melting
away, it's just standing there rocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's, that's one I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I, um, we maybe can ask, I can ask the
first community question, um, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: from Joe Grooves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I imagine from Skrewston as well
in spirit, um, they want to know what the
[SPEAKER_04]: shoreline, what you've observed the
shoreline tends to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, the shoreline, it comes through
pretty, pretty strong in crosses for the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the turps, the, it has this on any funk
trash kind of just nastiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's super loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it's when it's flowering,
you know, you got some shoreline in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it, it comes through really well for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, it throws these fat colas,
you know, it's in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not super vigorous, but once you flip
it, it, it just beasts out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, of the Appalachian
crosses, that's probably the, that and
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the GMO cross are the best yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's, it's, um, it's just a
phenomenal plant and it passes the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, the Appalachian gives it
a little bit, a little bit more vigor in
[SPEAKER_00]: veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it, it's easier to get up and going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, the funk, the shoreline funk
is what, what I, what I want it to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily what it does pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did it do with the GMO?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm interested in the GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's a cool one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, GMO is, is pretty well known
for dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It dominates a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, with Appalachia, it, it still comes
through really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, if you want a close
representation of GMO, you should pop them
[SPEAKER_00]: because you'll get, you'll get some that
are kind of dead ringers for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also get some, yeah, you also get some
that have that same kind of resin
[SPEAKER_00]: production and that same, um, that same
kind of dumping ability of GMOs that have
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more tropical flavor to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still, still have a ton of stretch,
um, but they have a lot of fuel on the
[SPEAKER_00]: back end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, that's a good cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're looking for something that's
a little more, um, you know, modern kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of weed, like I don't like most modern
things I try.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like gelatos at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I'm not a big fan of gelatos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fan of any cookies, any kind of
cakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried a ton of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I like to grow weeds that
gets me high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that stuff just doesn't do it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO is I think probably the most
remarkable plant that's come out of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most recent eras of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it's a, it's an incredible plant
and I just wanted, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted something that people could,
could find GMO, but maybe have a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more variability than a lot of the,
you know, GMO workout there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, definitely the one that interests me
and, uh, is the electric Boogaloo cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, that was a bit of a beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, locals has a really good
kind of mix of Enos going right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one outdoor that is, um,
massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's hasn't started this flower yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it's yeah, like, I don't know,
eight feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a giant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but there, there is, um, you know,
I tried reversing electric Boogaloo
[SPEAKER_00]: several times and it just didn't,
it didn't produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I was, I, it has some really
interesting stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some plants in there that look
like Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some plants in there that,
yeah, there's some, you know, some sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: expressions that have a ton of the kind of
candy mango that I associate with green
[SPEAKER_00]: craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, electric Boogaloo has,
has mango, but more so like mid flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: by, you know, if you take it, if you take
it to the end, that kind of dissipates and
[SPEAKER_00]: you have like, you know, a spicy just,
I mean, it's an amazing finished flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, I wanted to see if, you know,
that cross could maybe bring out a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more of that into the finished flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does, um, so there's, there's a,
there's a pretty wide, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a, there's a wide mix in that one,
but a lot of, a lot of sativa expressions,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a few with nice running colas and,
um, you know, I'm a huge fan of sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, I love them that and dog
shit, electric Boogaloo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one I smoke every single day until
I run out, like I just did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, that's, that's a great one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if it's like, uh, like a lot of
us that grew up on Mexican stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: just have this long lasting love for,
for highs like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, I have a love for, for all those
types of plants myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's, um, well it's, but it's,
I think a little bit more palatable to a
[SPEAKER_00]: broader audience because like,
you know, hazes or Mexicans or Colombians,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can, they can get you like paranoid
and disoriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get, you know, just so ripped that
you're, you know, confused, disoriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like, you know, tripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, but, uh, dog shit is just,
it's a, it's a up high, but it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great flavor and you're just
soaring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, it's like a memory of
the first, you know, one of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: times you got really high and you're like
riding your bike or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a beautiful childhood bliss
kind of high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's one of the ones that I
realized at our get together that we had
[SPEAKER_02]: last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't anybody in the room that
didn't like, absolutely love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, agreed or disagreed on different
things except for dog shit for some
[SPEAKER_02]: reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, from the first time I smoked it,
I've, I've just loved that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my all time favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, your KMD was fire,
fire, fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still one of my favorite grams of
KMDs ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I get it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there anything else you wanted to add
about this, your recent release?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause otherwise I was going to move us on
to you maybe, maybe give us a sneak
[SPEAKER_04]: preview of what you're doing now or what's
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only other one I'll mention,
just cause I have a lot of people ask
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot, a lot of people ask me what the
most fuely line that I have is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, the, the gorilla blue
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I just harvested a couple of those and
that is just that rank fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some sweetness come through,
but it's more of like a, like GG four to
[SPEAKER_00]: me has like a artificial chocolatey miss
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and this has like fuel with like a,
a like powdered cocoa milk chocolatey
[SPEAKER_00]: thing on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just intoxicating to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, that's one where I
haven't done a lot of breeding with GG
[SPEAKER_00]: four and I wasn't, you know, I wasn't sure
on it, but man, that was one that really
[SPEAKER_00]: surprised me when I grow them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, there's some phenomenal plants
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of us that like have tried
to avoid using a lot of high clones waited
[SPEAKER_02]: a long time to use GG four because it was
so heavily pushed, like maybe even prior
[SPEAKER_02]: to the cookies, there was just so stuffed
in your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you need to be growing GG four.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't interest in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like a poly hybrid to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I figured, okay, that's going to breed
so variant that why would I even care?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it breeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's remarkably consistent for being a,
yeah, for being like a poly hybrid bag
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew, you know, half of the plants could
have been cuts of the same plant that I
[SPEAKER_00]: grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, yeah, it has, I think the least
least variety in any of my lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was one of the last to grow that cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, cause I, it was, like I said,
I just didn't want anything to do with it
[SPEAKER_02]: just because of how many other people were
using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just thought I'd do something
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I finally did, I was like,
Oh damn, this is actually pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like how this breeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually good to smoke on its own
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know CSI had that same sentiment and
like he hit me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, damn, this is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why didn't anybody tell us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's, it's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does really well outside here
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of sticks around for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of why I kept it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been, I've been pretty surprised
with the way it reads.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you guys mentioned it because
yeah, I was going to point out that I
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't see many of you working with it
until relatively recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Matt Elituri under that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's, he said I had to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like Josie a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got along and, and, and then I
started smoking everybody's grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, God damn, it's actually kind
of good, but will it breed like this?
[SPEAKER_02]: More importantly than anything like it,
not only is it a good grower, it breeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very well, true to type kind of,
you know?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm, I got to plug the fact that these,
these seats, these packs are available on
[SPEAKER_04]: riotseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go there, check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, so I thought maybe now to,
to, to more or less wrap up a bit on your
[SPEAKER_04]: work in this like linear fashion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you be able to give us an idea of
like what you're looking towards now and
[SPEAKER_04]: in, in for the future?
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a question from Moonbeard about
Hayes experiments.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that he's heard of that you're,
you might be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have that going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a few things before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have seeds done for a few other
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is I, I was selecting a
Appalachian out of the F3, looking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: candidate to do a green crack back cross
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some hiccups with, you know,
the sourcing of the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to get it from another source for
political reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have that cross, those seeds finishing up
now for the back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've already harvested, I wanted to
remake that Appalachian diesel that I did
[SPEAKER_00]: a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I seeded a pretty large sour diesel
plant and I seeded the headband cut that
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, goes by LA Kush from That's a
Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's another very nice diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor, outdoor, it has extreme potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I seeded that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few other things, I crossed it to my
favorite Santa Cruz rec plant from Pac,
[SPEAKER_00]: Santa Cruz Goat Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a plant that was just a beast in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very kind of train wreck dominant
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the last few weeks of flower,
it had this really nice spicy blue essence
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a really, really nice high rate of
the Santa Cruz Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And train wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I seeded that plant with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually just popped some of those to
try out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have the green crack fully
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those, you know, those would be ready
to test here shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, then I had another smaller run
of some Kim D Appalachia stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was messing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: F2ing it, backcrossing it to Vic and D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just doing a few things there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of building block work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's probably just going to be
stuff I mess with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now I'm, I am doing like a haze
hybrid hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I popped super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've popped Northern Lights 5 haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mango haze that came via Wally Duck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the mango haze IBL line.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been bred in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a Neville's haze, mango haze,
also from Wally Duck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of all those lines, I've grown them
out and I have my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mango haze, I think, is the the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants, the plants are a little bit,
a little bit more finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, it's not as easy a plant
to grow as super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: But super silver haze tends to be pretty,
pretty much a sort of penaline dom plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a ton of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the mango haze, you get it,
you get some sweeter spiciness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high is consistently better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a better representation of
what people want in a sativa type high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as, not as muddled, you know,
super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can feel the indica influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but the mango haze, that's my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a male that I really liked in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be, you know, making some
more of those seeds as my personal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's something Wally's working
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but I'm, I'm crossing that to a lot of
cuts that I have, plants that I have that
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will be- I'm going to start
calling you Virginia mango, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, dude, I need to get this off
the hook away from mango.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kept going to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, something you love
and that just is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and mango haze is, is way different
than like a candied mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, you know, I don't know if
I was naming it, if I call it mango haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, that was the name of the
mother was mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but yeah, I'll be, I'll, I'll be doing
a bunch of, a bunch of hybrids with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hitting it to a bunch of the sativa
cuts that I have, some of the heavier
[SPEAKER_00]: hitters, you know, the Kim dogs and all
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's a few that I'm,
I'm really interested to check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hit the, the A5 haze with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping everybody's not too scared to
release those seed mines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause last I checked, no one else gives a
fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I, I have friends in on
them and I'm like, what the fuck are you
[SPEAKER_02]: doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody else is releasing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you don't have to check it on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's, you know, there are political
issues there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I don't, I wasn't told anything about
it when I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, there are reasons not to
release it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A5 is, is one of the most difficult plants
that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's not easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, you know, it's just not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people that are used to growing,
you know, OG cushions, salary easels,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the modern kind of, it's just a
whole, whole fucking different ball game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's a fussy little plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you know, and you know,
I think a lot of those hybrids,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to be more kind of,
it's not a beginner growers plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to testing them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that, you know,
I'm passionate about that, that type of
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, I'm looking forward to,
to actually getting to test them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we need more of that in our community
as is like more of those type of highs,
[SPEAKER_02]: those offerings.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to get, it's going to get more
and more sparse as time goes on,
[SPEAKER_02]: because financially it's harder to produce
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully people take advantage of it
while it's here, you know, while it's
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the, the commercial viability of
something when breeding has never kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: been what I go for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not great at that side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically make things that I want to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to, I like to grow the best flower
that I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to have locked down in
seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not concerned about, you know,
how, how well it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something that I feel compelled
to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say that at this point of the
conversation, I'm so stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the archivist in me is so pleased to
have gotten all of that information from
[SPEAKER_04]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at this point, you know, was there
anything more you want to say about your
[SPEAKER_04]: work, your career so far?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because otherwise we can also launch into
the heap of questions that we've gotten
[SPEAKER_04]: from both Matt and the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think I'm good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, did you want to kick us off on some
of these more like open-ended questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we even have some like hypothetical
breeding projects.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't know if I'll cover some
of the hypotheticals because they're so
far away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far in, and I know we have a ton of
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's, you know, one of the questions I
had for you, and it's kind of a hard one
[SPEAKER_02]: because I thought of something that would
be hard for me to answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's something you, about the modern
seed era that you enjoy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like how, I like how accessible it is
for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always, I've always been a tinkerer
in the weed world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it's always been a passion
thing for me more than monetary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I like how accessible it is,
how, how so many different people are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, you know, a lot of the releases
you see, and I'm not going to name any
[SPEAKER_00]: names because I don't want to trash
anybody on it, but it's just the same shit
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed to the same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm, I can say that I'm
guilty of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've made the GMO cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, you know, I've crossed salaries,
all this stuff, but you know, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of incestuous lines crossed together,
the cookies, cookies, and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's, that's disheartening, but I like,
I like seeing the unique things that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like seeing people do it on a level
that, you know, is satisfying to them and
[SPEAKER_00]: less driven for, you know, having a drop
that sells out in 30 minutes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, you know, like CSI, you know,
I've had a ton of respect for him for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time and he does his passion projects
and you know, they don't pay the bills,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the kind of shit when I sneak a
order into him, that's what I get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want to see, I want to see
what the, you know, TK crossed a PCK is,
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, whatever, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to, you know, I like, I like
exploring different profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want, you know, something that
dumps that I can sell a bunch of rosin off
[SPEAKER_00]: over something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, you know, I like the, I just like
the overall abundance that's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's very different than the
Dutch, the Dutch era and that early hype
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of era.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, to me, you're talking a bit more
about now your breeding philosophy or kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of your philosophy towards cannabis in
general.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, do you, do you think it's,
it's evolved or changed much since those
[SPEAKER_04]: like brick weed seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of, you know, my number one goal
is still to have the best that I can have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, weed early on, I learned that I
could produce something better than I
[SPEAKER_00]: could get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's, there's not a lot
of things in life that I can have the best
[SPEAKER_00]: of, but I can have the best weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's still, that's still,
that's still like my number one goal and
[SPEAKER_00]: what I kind of, what I'm constantly going
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to bring in some of the,
the user questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got, I got a good one to start us off
because it's, I think it'd be fun in the
[SPEAKER_04]: wind wants to know what was your worst
year with the worst outdoor season?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've, uh, I, I had 20 years of gorilla
growing, so I've had some pretty fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: bad ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm trying to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had, yeah, I've had some shit
wiped out, but the worst I had,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, um, a pretty decent outdoor for the
area that I'm in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, enough that, you know,
there's some shit you thought about before
[SPEAKER_00]: he fell asleep at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it was most mostly all in three
sections kind of separated out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and in October, the whole fucking
thing got ripped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I had lost plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had lost plants many times mid-season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but this one, somebody got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody came and they got everything,
um, completely ripped me off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot riding on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty invested in that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but they left, I had a Neville's haze
plant out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking massive, taller than
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess they didn't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause it was, you know, it was mostly
kind of hybrid style plants, smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: busier plants and this one fucking tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got ripped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fucking defeated, feeling like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw that they left that plant and it
kind of sketched me out for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I didn't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, you know, I figured that was,
that was left for me to get fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever popped with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just let that thing go and we had a
pretty, pretty mild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fall that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, I think it was a couple
of days after Thanksgiving, I went back
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just about, just about done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I said, I said, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna, I'm gonna get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, you know, cut that plant down,
stashed it appropriately, drove it to
[SPEAKER_00]: where I was trying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I pretty much lost my whole
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except the only thing I had to smoke
until, you know, the next indoor run I
[SPEAKER_00]: did, which was probably going to be in the
spring was, you know, this, all this
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a phenomenal plant,
but it was so goddamn strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, you know, you can smoke that
sometimes, but you can't just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I was like four months into just
smoking Neville's haze all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you smoke it, you smoke it,
you go to the grocery store, you like
[SPEAKER_00]: start to walk in and you're like,
no, I can't do this shit right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, it's just like,
but it was, you know, it was an electric
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that, yeah, but I've had that I've
had floods wipe out gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had, you know, outdoor growing is
difficult enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elder gorilla growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you have to go into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that you get hassles the work you
put in out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be so, so stressful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, that'd be so heavy to lose like
a whole crop at like knowing each year in
[SPEAKER_02]: a row, you can get ripped.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would kill me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, um, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I don't have to do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, indoor growing, you, you know that
that's a possibility, but like,
[SPEAKER_02]: like gorilla growing, it just seems like
almost like a weird inevitability.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, there's so many
different things that can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people hunting people,
you know, just everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Serial killers, burying bodies,
the normal shit.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, PBJ asks, which of his lines would he
say these are just growing for each level
[SPEAKER_04]: of experience, novice, intermediate,
advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so the Appalachia stuff overall there,
it's, it makes for some very easy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, um, there, there are some that
are a little bit more finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, the dog shit Appalachia
is a little, a little more intermediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, those are pretty
easy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as a beginner, I would say that just
the F three Appalachia or the,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, all slew foot, which is the old Betsy
Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are, I mean, kind of set it and
forget it plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the intermediate ones would be stuff
like, you know, the lupus headband
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, nah, the GMO is pretty easy
to, um, but you know, when we,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I end up releasing any of the hay
stuff, that's going to be more on the
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced level of growing just cause mango
haze itself is a finicky plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the cuts that I really liked
that I'm using, um, as mothers,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, a lot of those are, are, you know,
more finicky plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have, they go longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot more stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a lot more, you have to think
about it a lot more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we've got a big one from Blazer Panda,
a good mate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does High Lonesome like to go by
Appalachia daddy or father Appy?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, local calls me daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that is true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause local also asked, what's it like
being my dad?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, well, you know, that's another
instance of kind of set it and forget it.
[SPEAKER_04]: More earnest one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, in the wind wants to know a bit more
about your grow tick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, he says like besides the soil mix,
what's your what are your bed weeks,
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoor dates?
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess he wants to know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it, it varies greatly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I kinda, I, I do a lot of different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in the last few years I've gotten
into, um, doing some light depths outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, where I used to put plants out,
uh, around, you know, the first of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of June.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm, I'm depping in the spring and my
full season plants don't go out until,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, mid July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, I do a lot of things,
a lot of different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this year I did, um, a depth run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my full season stuff going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have a few extra plants that are out
in the gorilla spy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just, I don't have,
I'm always looking for further,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, best way to deal with all the
seeds that have popped basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so it'll mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I do, I do almost, almost fully
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause I, I just like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way I did soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way plants can kind of take
what they want when they want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I try to try to keep, you know,
fungus and bugs off them and kind of let
[SPEAKER_00]: them do their thing outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I know Matt, you mentioned we probably
wouldn't get into the hypothetical
[SPEAKER_04]: breathing scenarios, but I thought Moon
did have an interesting one that I think
[SPEAKER_04]: is broad enough that we can maybe dip into
it, which is the one where he asked me
[SPEAKER_02]: about a three way, three way with low
weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, oh, oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: My gosh.
[SPEAKER_04]: So his question is, if you were going to
try and make a modern four way,
[SPEAKER_04]: what plants or at least what traditional
regions do you think you might pull from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, would this be like reinventing the old
four way or like a, just a four way hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: of different?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a four way hybrid of your,
your choosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would probably do a Colombian cross
to a Mexican as the father plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to say in Afghani cause it's so
broad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it'd probably be a Hawaiian,
Afghani cross to a Mexican, Colombian is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I say Hawaiian, I'm thinking
of like a hybrid type, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Island weed, an older, you know,
older one like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, um, a lot of Oh,
Hawking, um, was planted in Hawaii and
[SPEAKER_00]: they kind of added in Afghani as they got
it and something with that influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a, I'm a big fan of central Americans
since he was, um, I really like Southeast
[SPEAKER_00]: Asian ones, but they don't like the
intersects traits that are so abundant in
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I'd probably keep it, um,
central American was just a touch of
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani and Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you, Matt?
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, what's the goal?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the end goal?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the end goal here?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd probably end up with something
blueberry though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck else would I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think the last one that I've got on
my list from ring of fire is how has your
[SPEAKER_04]: perception of the industry changed over
the years and why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, you know, I, I have never been
an industry guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't, I'm not a big fan of the
legal weed scene in every instance that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen up into quite a few States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of, um, you know,
legal weed and it's, it's not anything
[SPEAKER_00]: that I would want to be stuck smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I do, I do like the, um, the easy
access for home growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think, you know, that, that's just,
that's going to take cannabis further in
[SPEAKER_00]: the end than the commercialization of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, um, you know, you hear a ton of
people talk about niche markets and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how there's going to be a,
this, you know, top shelf markets going to
[SPEAKER_00]: arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, you know, I think that's a long way
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, um, you know, the, the only way
to create a demand for something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: is to have people, you know, become
empowered to grow something different,
[SPEAKER_00]: something unique, and, you know,
with a more interesting high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's, that's something
that home growers are going to do and
[SPEAKER_00]: share with their circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I really think that's the most
viable path forward for the betterment of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is through home growers and,
you know, obvious people that are really
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate about it, not just looking for
a paycheck by growing a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: warehouse of wedding cake or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the home growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think in many ways as well,
like the last breeding series was,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, well for everyone, but I think we are
also have one eye for sure on the
[SPEAKER_04]: hobbyists and people at home or people
growing in smaller spaces in general,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, that's a good sentiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have much advice for people in big
warehouses, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, you know, it's,
it's big business there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's trying to, you know, trying to get
by, trying to make a marketable product
[SPEAKER_00]: that moves fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, it's big business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just mean from the perspective of,
I just haven't like, I wouldn't even know
[SPEAKER_02]: where to begin from that perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I just don't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: What I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, everything we do is definitely
targeted towards, uh, smaller pros.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I am out of, I am done with my list of
community questions, but, uh, hi,
[SPEAKER_04]: Nelson.
[SPEAKER_04]: You, we did talk about one thing,
um, before this chat, which was,
[SPEAKER_04]: you mentioned that you were actually
drying seeds at the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you want to like, just touch on,
give a little, you know, quick overview of
[SPEAKER_04]: like how that process works for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, when I chop plants,
I pretty much treat them like their flower
[SPEAKER_00]: to dry them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep the temperature as low as
possible, which is difficult this time of
[SPEAKER_00]: year, but you know, the, you know,
60, 60 rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to get close to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I'll dry them slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, kind of let the seeds mature in the
buds as best as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I paper bag, um, when I, when I chuck
seeds, I will drive them further,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, on screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to, uh, once they're good and
dry, I like to refrigerate them for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of, you know, simulate a winter tight
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will, um, generally start
cracking them and testing them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, nothing, nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super fancy, just making sure I get as
much of that moisture out as possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, before I get them cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think these are just the
little ways we can extend on, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: say that seed making episode that we did
by asking you guys about some of your
[SPEAKER_04]: actual processes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so that's really, really cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, man, did you have anything else for
high and lonesome?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, it was a pleasure having you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, um, an honor to call you my
friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I know how many people have been
asking for this again, have a whole more
[SPEAKER_02]: longer version of the Highland episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it went well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything, anything from you Highland?
[SPEAKER_04]: Lonesome before we conclude?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's, uh, it's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me and, uh, letting me
talk about weed in the geeky way that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: accustomed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh dude, this was, this was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, gentlemen, with that,
I guess we'll, we'll call it a day and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, thanks again.
