[SPEAKER_04]: going Slightly less because we bought so
it's 2300 roughly a little bit more but
[SPEAKER_04]: not much It's a lot smaller in this place
as far as that house, but the property is
[SPEAKER_04]: big.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm stoked on that Tonight we will be
covering.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what are you smoking expels tonight?
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be covering the four of the era
post 2006 which really was I mean I chose
[SPEAKER_04]: that because that's when I come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So mostly the tail end of overgrow
Cannabis world a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I Don't remember when planet ganja dipped
out Some grass city troll it up Pop pimp
[SPEAKER_04]: trike home Kings The farter Stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a seed depot stuff it Yeah,
I see Maga course There's a big point to
[SPEAKER_04]: it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's that a lot of people like they
weren't around during the forums It's
[SPEAKER_04]: really easy to tell who they are and the
ones that pretend like they were it's also
[SPEAKER_04]: really easy to tell that they were because
or that they weren't because they only
[SPEAKER_04]: reference the ones that are still up and
only quote the forums that are still up
[SPEAKER_04]: which was a very very I Can't I can't
mention that one sub Rob since it's
[SPEAKER_04]: private.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to mention it try to follow
rules on that one, but Yeah, I mean if
[SPEAKER_04]: people try to quote stuff all the time But
you're only seeing a brief glimpse of what
[SPEAKER_04]: happened back then some of the most
salacious fucking horrible shit went down
[SPEAKER_04]: on sites like seed depot where a lot of
people started popping up a lot of people
[SPEAKER_04]: that are selling seeds are popping up on
seed depot and I'm sure they are super
[SPEAKER_04]: stoked that you can't find that shit But
we do have the way back machine and I
[SPEAKER_04]: actually haven't tested that for seed
depot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see Yeah ganja planet ganja was
on way back machine as well, but only
[SPEAKER_04]: certain Threads were it was really hard to
find any consistency and why certain
[SPEAKER_04]: things were or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not so See I wonder if I can still
bring in Caleb once I bring in West We've
[SPEAKER_04]: got a teaching how to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on request to join But how do I add
in people wasabi invite to join,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay That's all I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, what's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: I exist You know, you look like you're not
dead yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm definitely not dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good deal So What's up with the third
party waiting for him wait for him for a
[SPEAKER_04]: few minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just talked to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be on Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I was just telling everyone we're
gonna be going over the forum era post
[SPEAKER_04]: overgrow so 2006 roughly and on and I was
explaining how there are a lot of a forum
[SPEAKER_04]: still up that were around during that time
like the farm I see mad Troll it up some
[SPEAKER_04]: of the some of the others that came around
that time But there are a lot that are not
[SPEAKER_04]: up and people that like to pretend that
they were around back then Often reference
[SPEAKER_04]: ones that are still up that they can go
back and like reread and pretend like hey
[SPEAKER_04]: I was I was there I know what was going on
but they're missing like 90% of the
[SPEAKER_04]: conversations that were going on because
those aren't even accessible any longer
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the one of the things I notice
about that era is that You know a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: times we catch people on stuff Because
people go back to bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and they read You know threads and
things like that to pick up years and
[SPEAKER_03]: tidbits and information that like make
their their story sound better Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they weren't there to know Who was who
or like who to take seriously or what was
[SPEAKER_03]: misinformation even then?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know and so a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a tell You know it is a big tell it's
a big tell but to someone that never read
[SPEAKER_03]: any of those forums You can come out and
confidently start jabbing about a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff Yeah, and sound like you were there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Not I'm not gonna say anybody's name,
but someone made a post the other day that
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously was not around on the forum And
said you know X person got cloned from Y
[SPEAKER_04]: person got cloned from Z person and it was
just Super off like the most off it could
[SPEAKER_03]: be I mean we I'm That's learning from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try we try not to name names when it's
not but it was pretty funny the chain of
[SPEAKER_03]: custody Yeah, that was asserted You know
you just had you just had to laugh at a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain point, but yeah, I will say even
back then like You know I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly know how to describe it But I
would say that like like over grow even
[SPEAKER_03]: had some of the best commentary But also
some of the worst Like you kind of the
[SPEAKER_03]: forums really helped figuring out what you
were doing if you already went in there
[SPEAKER_03]: with some connection and some ability to
discern Yeah, you know cannabis world was
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit more like where the adults
gathered.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah over grow you could have like
everyone from Like some 17 year old kid
[SPEAKER_03]: shit posting you even though we didn't use
that term back then yeah to like Kamara
[SPEAKER_03]: and Sam skunk man and PhDs and breeding
talking shit in another in another area
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it really was like a cross
section of weed in America my main my main
[SPEAKER_04]: thing would be like I would compare that
to like grass city from my era grass city
[SPEAKER_04]: and Roll it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We always called it troll it up,
but those two were like what everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: would say like that's where everybody
everybody had an account on those pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: much because that's where everybody
started at during that era and then slowly
[SPEAKER_04]: you'd see people migrate but then those
the ones that hung out in that area kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of never really seemed to go anywhere as
far as their knowledge or Making any
[SPEAKER_04]: headway with anything really that's how I
saw it Yeah, I mean and you know it should
[SPEAKER_03]: be said too that like you know there was
different different forums had different I
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know different ethics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe is the best way to put it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah You know some some were more lightly
moderated and things got left up You know
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously like hate speech and various
other aspects was was eliminated And you
[SPEAKER_03]: know or but a lot of times you know unlike
IG or whatever You know if you didn't like
[SPEAKER_03]: the threads got left They might get locked
if arguments got too heated, but they
[SPEAKER_03]: would be left Yeah, we're in today's
environment on IG a lot of times people
[SPEAKER_03]: just get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah It's all it's all what do you
call that curated?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all curated as soon as it starts
going off the rails or as soon as they
[SPEAKER_03]: start seeing information They don't want
out there Yeah, they'll just delete
[SPEAKER_03]: comments, or they'll delete the whole
thread or they'll turn off comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah right away You know and then you know
I see mag you know there was you know
[SPEAKER_03]: there was an in crowd and an out crowd
mm-hmm You know definitely I was the out
[SPEAKER_04]: crowd I I think I had a record for being
the person most banned from Every forum
[SPEAKER_04]: and it I think that I mean I even had my
own forums back in the day that people
[SPEAKER_03]: rocked on You know it got bad I mean it
was interesting in the sense that like in
[SPEAKER_03]: the beginning in overgrown cannabis world
and stuff I was super excited,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I got on there to share information
with a bunch of people And then you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I was always nervous about doing any
kind like you know I lived in Mendo or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever so I didn't really need to like
meet new weed people yeah, but I liked
[SPEAKER_03]: Learning what other people far away knew
yeah, but a lot of people used it in the
[SPEAKER_03]: DMS to trade clones and do all this type
of stuff I never really did that I was
[SPEAKER_03]: more like an in-person kind of kind of guy
Yeah, and then when obviously when
[SPEAKER_03]: heaven's stairway got in trouble,
and they shut all that down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I got scared so You know this era
that we're gonna talk about like 2006 on
[SPEAKER_03]: it really is CSI and Matt's era Yeah,
it really is where you know I might have
[SPEAKER_03]: been Lurking a little bit poking around
here and there And even some other friends
[SPEAKER_03]: of ours that aren't going to join like our
buddy high and lonesome Yeah, you know
[SPEAKER_03]: there was some people that were they were
extremely active in that air sure and know
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of the Who you know who is who is a
jackass who was kind?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who was a problem back then you know where
stuff came from and?
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the interesting things about weed
is that it reinvents itself every five or
[SPEAKER_03]: ten years yeah, so You get all these new
people coming in and people get to rebrand
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves Yeah, now.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's happening every six months.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems yeah, well it's modern fast
turnover.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah modern marketing I mentioned that I
mentioned this before, but it was kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: like what the What the old deadheads told
me about how dead tour used to be before?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Grateful Dead had touch of gray a big
hit yeah, it was small Everybody knew kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of got vetted in you know things didn't
change That much and then you know oh my
[SPEAKER_03]: god big ups to Danimal Okay, so then and
then and then there was a top they had a
[SPEAKER_03]: top ten hit and literally hundreds of
thousands of new people showed up Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and how do you assimilate them into your
community that fast?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can't really yeah, you know it
becomes difficult so a lot of times like
[SPEAKER_03]: old-timers or whatever they feel
overwhelmed Yeah, because like the norms
[SPEAKER_03]: of their community And what they could
expect you know and instead of being like
[SPEAKER_03]: a respected elder somebody's like who the
fuck is this guy Yeah, why do I have to
[SPEAKER_03]: listen to you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know where before when it was
smaller like those people might have had
[SPEAKER_04]: respect Yeah, yeah, that's a much it did
get very different And I want to say it
[SPEAKER_04]: wasn't quite at cookies where everything
took a big swing But it wasn't much long
[SPEAKER_04]: after cookies came around that the forum
the whole idea of forms kind of changed
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that also had to do with
Instagram Which is also why cookies kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of even got even more blown up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think social media Yeah, the kind of the
difference between the I would say the
[SPEAKER_03]: forums were mostly writing with some
pictures Where Instagram flipped it a
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred and eighty degrees to being
exactly all pictures with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: writing Yeah, so you see some of these old
write-ups that people have and their
[SPEAKER_03]: paragraphs, and you know they're like a
small essay yeah Right where people ask me
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff all the time on IG, and it's really
hard because it's like What are you gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: write a novel in the comments?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like you're trying to write
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like this long like what can I
yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a haiku Yes, how can I get my my
thing across and like X amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: syllables or four sentences yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you kind of have to especially if
you're on Twitter right and then and then
[SPEAKER_03]: you end up and then you end up leaving on
a lot of nuance in detail where on the
[SPEAKER_03]: forum era people could like write three or
four Paragraphs each back and forth and
[SPEAKER_04]: some like empty could write really really
just Bad really bad an illegible stuff for
[SPEAKER_03]: paragraphs and paragraphs I mean when you
write paragraphs you really realize why we
[SPEAKER_03]: invented punctuation Yeah, for sure you
know why we invented paragraphs in the
[SPEAKER_03]: first place spacing periods commas all the
various aspects it really helps because
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, you know what one of the things that
Hurts you online is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nuance gets lost yeah, it does are you
being sarcastic?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, being funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your body language?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know all those types of things You
know yeah, that was actually a good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know in the overgrow era digital
cameras You know didn't exist yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean I was talking I was actually
talking about that in the in the one that
[SPEAKER_03]: you missed because you were you know you
were otherwise Occupied where it was like
[SPEAKER_03]: people documenting their stuff really
advanced a lot more when digital cameras
[SPEAKER_03]: came out oh, yeah, and then exponentially
once Phones had cameras yeah once phones
[SPEAKER_03]: had cameras is all bets off the era where
you had to get your own stuff developed
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on sadly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not oh yeah, I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not very documented I mean I was it I
was at CSI's house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know happy year ago or something
like that We were looking through a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: of boxes of his Polaroids right yeah,
but they fade Yeah, that I can't sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: They fade You know and maybe if you would
have kept them in some kind of like a
[SPEAKER_03]: perfectly sealed environment with the
right humidity or something like that You
[SPEAKER_03]: know but yeah, you're looking at Polaroids
from 95 or 6 or 7 or whatever and a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: them the colors are bleeding into each
other And it's hard to make it's not It's
[SPEAKER_03]: not you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not shark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah You know yeah That sucks that sucks
bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have never guessed that until he
told me that yeah I mean you know he's got
[SPEAKER_03]: a couple shoe boxes full Yeah,
and I have busted his chops to get him
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking scanned I was like you got to get
those scanned at least for history.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like won't do any good I mean I you
know I had my I had my my my first
[SPEAKER_03]: daughter in oh nine You know and I think
and I can look back on my phone I think
[SPEAKER_03]: you know the first real camera on an
iPhone came out no wait oh No,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, late.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh late.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait You know and and that's kind of
that that was a revolution in itself Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure because then you can just pull it
out of your pocket and be like there's my
[SPEAKER_04]: weed plant click It's always amazing that
with all these cell phones.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't really see many like real
documented UFO pics I know I'm it's kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of off-tangent, but I just thought about
that well I will say as a As a you know
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody who's pulled a lot of tarps in
their day mm-hmm that you know a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: times when you pull tarp on you you're
doing a light dab You're you're pulling
[SPEAKER_03]: tarp at six or seven o'clock at night
Right yeah, and then you go back out there
[SPEAKER_03]: after dark which in June might be nine
thirty or ten o'clock at night Mm-hmm
[SPEAKER_03]: right so pull the tarp off so everything
can breathe because you only want to
[SPEAKER_03]: darken it for as much as you need to right
oh Yeah, and you don't want to trap in all
[SPEAKER_03]: that moisture and all that right so you
got to go out there and you know Mendo or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever in the woods and Sometimes I
would see the most beautiful skies the
[SPEAKER_03]: most beautiful moons just yeah,
and Your phone could not show you what my
[SPEAKER_03]: eyes could see oh yeah for sure I would
take I would take you know pictures and
[SPEAKER_03]: You know and it would just never and I'd
go online and look.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I take better night photos?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it's just not a camera with like
a nice lens and you know the ability to
[SPEAKER_03]: like You know it's just not it's just
meant to show dicks and tits.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all you're supposed to be taking
pictures of fellows ladies You know and
[SPEAKER_03]: and so you know there's there's an aspect
to that where it's like I can bet Like if
[SPEAKER_03]: you can't see like nobody can imagine how
beautiful this full moon is tonight Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can't capture that well How are
you gonna capture like I'm sure there's
[SPEAKER_03]: like this is that there's a weird thing in
the sky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's yeah How are you gonna?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know especially back in oh eight or oh
nine How am I gonna pull out my two or two
[SPEAKER_03]: and a half megapixel camera?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah on my phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm gonna like capture it No,
you know it took a long time for Phones to
[SPEAKER_03]: even begin to catch up to like what 35
millimeter could do you're busting my
[SPEAKER_04]: skeptical Comet not so You know crushing
my skepticism I fully believe that there
[SPEAKER_03]: are aliens I Just disbelieve most people
that tell them try to tell me a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: facts about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's not sure there are I just
don't know if they've ever been near earth
[SPEAKER_03]: You know like I I have I that's where my
skepticism comes in when people Start
[SPEAKER_03]: writing getting like very long YouTube's
about all kinds of specifics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know yeah, I get weird Yeah,
yeah, I mean I'll say this you know and
[SPEAKER_03]: then Kayla and then he's officially
fucking late.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but You know when we were talking
about the the early the early 2000s or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever I you know I did that whole
episode when you weren't here Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hunting so hard for old stuff then
stuff from the 80s stuff from the 70s hell
[SPEAKER_03]: even stuff from Some of the 90s yeah,
and it was a royal bitch and then nobody
[SPEAKER_03]: cared about it And I and I searched for
years and years and years and you know
[SPEAKER_03]: like we have a pretty good network of
friends Yeah, you know and it was really
[SPEAKER_03]: hard and now within the last five years as
Ancient stuff has become popular Mm-hmm,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm not please don't take this the
wrong way if anybody's holding anything,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I've never seen so much like 79

post 2006 it was the end of the overgrow
[SPEAKER_04]: era and of the cannabis world era and
maybe maybe You could talk about some of
[SPEAKER_04]: the things that you saw during those those
that integral period between the end of
[SPEAKER_04]: overgrow and the beginning of things like
the farm What kind of what kind of strains

[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, that's so that was the
overgrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was okay So yeah, that that's well
long gone unless somebody has a archives
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you remember like around overgrow

[SPEAKER_03]: was if you knew it can herb Sometimes you
could put it into too small of a pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could let it get dry You could beat it
up a bit You could try to collect see if
[SPEAKER_03]: it could throw some that was like the that
was like our way of you know Right,
[SPEAKER_03]: can you beat it up enough to get some
pollen off it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember us so much so much way you just
flower them out for like 80 or 90 days and
[SPEAKER_01]: get a couple bananas Yeah, rope there's a
little ization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I Don't know where you got that term
from for it, but yeah, I remember yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's a special guy Actually,
I did like is this when his book came out
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do like the Soma beds I don't own that
they were interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just they're just deep indoor beds
on wheels Yeah, you know is basically what
[SPEAKER_03]: they were You know with with you know some
drainage in the bottom and some layering
[SPEAKER_03]: you know maybe they have some rocks and
they have some like and then they have a
[SPEAKER_03]: layer of of ground cover or something and
then you put soil on top and and they have
[SPEAKER_01]: received Huh, they had the air tubes on
I'm in all four corners where they're down
[SPEAKER_03]: to the lower roots You would look like big
pieces of PVC with holes drilled in and
[SPEAKER_03]: you would put those on the side And those
would go all the way in the corners to the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom Yeah, so that you would actually
get and that would connect to the gravel
[SPEAKER_03]: at the bottom so that you bring air Yeah,
it wasn't the worst idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: No I've done that recently and especially
for well, it's not so much you had to go
[SPEAKER_03]: trees, you know, I mean, you know look
Look at look at a bunch of you could you
[SPEAKER_03]: could actually grow a bed With you know,
homie style with 25 or 30 plants if you
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted Yeah, right, right, right,
you know, and then you didn't have to
[SPEAKER_03]: worry about individual ones dying Right,
right because you just watered the bed and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything stays alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, I used to use those no drain
beds way back in a 2000 or so didn't know
[SPEAKER_01]: dream beds just shallow like six Eds,
you know How'd that work out?
[SPEAKER_01]: I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, definitely some interesting stuff That
was back in my not so organic days I used
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to know this used to be pretty
funny where I used to know a lot of guys
[SPEAKER_03]: in Mendo That were organic like April
through August And then come August
[SPEAKER_03]: they're like not or September they're not
quite seeing their buds get as big as they
[SPEAKER_03]: want And then they figure like well,
what's one big tub of pink powder gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: really do to my organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's basically organic Yeah,
just a couple a couple doses of this zero
[SPEAKER_03]: fifty thirty It's gonna get me where I
need to be and it's gonna make it happy
[SPEAKER_03]: and I've been organic for five months
already You know, so it'll all flush out
[SPEAKER_01]: at the end and it's definitely still
organic Yeah, that stuff was us yeah Bud
[SPEAKER_01]: Blaster three cheers for grow more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah But what was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: But Bud Blaster was the was the Canadian
Hetty version Yeah, it was it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was Canadian.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was it was it was one of those,
you know powdered whatever it was all this
[SPEAKER_03]: it was all the same there was a bunch of
people that came out with zero fifty
[SPEAKER_03]: thirty and Tried to make it seem like
their zero fifty thirty was special The
[SPEAKER_03]: one thing I'll say about the the Bud
Blaster is that They had a they had their
[SPEAKER_03]: own special grinder Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So their powder was super fine and it
actually dissolved Some of the cheap stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: you get there in like a thousand gallon
tank or whatever and you're up on a ladder
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're dumping stuff like that in
there and Then you get some softballs at
[SPEAKER_03]: the bottom that you're like wondering how
to hit with the stick to break up Because
[SPEAKER_03]: it wouldn't actually dissolve Yeah,
you know, all right, so but that's off
[SPEAKER_03]: topic, you know, I suppose we should
probably ratchet back around So we got to
[SPEAKER_03]: convince we got to convince Caleb and Matt
to talk because this is really their era
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is oh six.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh nine.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not my online presence Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the various characters the various
things that were going on the the stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: that was happening It's pretty much this
is when these two You know CSI used to be
[SPEAKER_03]: known as You know white trash redneck But
yeah, you know, but that but that's where
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know archive was Doctor or the
doctor Yeah, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's where a lot of the Monica a lot of
the oldest nicknames and monikers People
[SPEAKER_03]: still kind of reference each other like by
some of those first names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Don't know nobody's real name Didn't
need to ain't no purpose in it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and unlike IG you didn't you
never a lot of these people you never saw
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah My chick always asked me like what
what's his name?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I don't fucking know Ask him
that you know, that's just weird Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: she thinks I'm a freak for not knowing
anybody's first names after all these
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't fucking know I Don't like it do
his taxes for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck then you know that for It
was very it was very similar to that on
[SPEAKER_03]: like we on dead tour and stuff like that
because everybody you know Everybody had a
[SPEAKER_03]: nickname.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Yeah, you know everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean maybe maybe you guys could talk
about like, you know Who who who were some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the big I don't want to say the word
influencer Maybe but who are some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: people that were sort of like driving the
conversations?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are you excited to hear?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know posting on stuff like and then
maybe just like how hard it was to get
[SPEAKER_03]: information back there Because a lot of
these forums, you know, you guys were
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about the chem dog You know,
there was an aspect where the reason why
[SPEAKER_03]: you know somebody like, you know skunk VA
has his name or chem dog 101 or any of
[SPEAKER_03]: these things is because I had some form or
another on IC mag or whatever It was the
[SPEAKER_03]: first time these things started getting
argued about and debated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah by people outside and a lot of times
What happens to is that these things
[SPEAKER_03]: become references because then you've got
this guy comes out and says this thing on
[SPEAKER_03]: IC mag at this year And then three years
later on whatever on roll it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say he's saying this and now on IG
he said this and this You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they always they always want to be
like this is the most current story.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what you should believe Yeah,
yeah, and in some cases those forms don't
[SPEAKER_03]: exist anymore and they're very fortunate
that they don't and you know, one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the ways that CSI got his
reputation as inspector is he was really
[SPEAKER_03]: good at using your own words against You
hey Well, I just but I just mean in the
[SPEAKER_03]: sense of someone would like confidently
say this this this this and this and then
[SPEAKER_03]: He would be like, well, why did you write?
[SPEAKER_03]: In your own words that bastard it's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you how do you make these two
things come together?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a bunch of swerve quotes I can
share You know and and that's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: things most people probably don't you know
who swerve is but there's been there's
[SPEAKER_03]: been a bunch of people You know that come
that you know flash in the pants that come
[SPEAKER_03]: and go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they come up They have their moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: They they they spew a bunch of shit They
make a bunch of money all the sudden their
[SPEAKER_03]: stories start to implode right,
yeah, and You know and in some cases they
[SPEAKER_03]: rebrand themselves and so again do it to
them to the new badge Right, right,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know Who I looked up to is gonna be a
lot different than maybe who Caleb Looked
[SPEAKER_04]: up to because when I first started coming
in it was way different than when Caleb
[SPEAKER_04]: started coming in, you know So who like
who were you looking up to during those
[SPEAKER_04]: years or who who is who do you think was?
[SPEAKER_04]: Influencing really well that that had some
respect during those years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean I liked you know Just just for
information, you know Alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked Joe Brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked you know chem dog math G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah You know skunk Viet Yeah,
and then on like the the og side of
[SPEAKER_01]: things, you know, I was I always liked You
know big Ricky He was old family red back
[SPEAKER_01]: then I actually a lot of people don't even
know but I Named my old family purple my
[SPEAKER_01]: first TK hybrid kind of after his old
handle old family red, you know Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I didn't action.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I gave him a lot of credit You know
chrome that was those were the years
[SPEAKER_01]: chrome was starting Out with the white,
you know, yeah, he actually was growing
[SPEAKER_01]: some of my my hybrids And then he
introduced the white when he was growing
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's when that started I Think
I was mostly into Bubba's ogs and chem
[SPEAKER_01]: dogs back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but uh What what were your your main
main interests though?
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I popped in, you know,
like Shanti Baba was still Pretty big and
[SPEAKER_04]: still had a good name a lot of the stuff I
was looking at when I came in was was
[SPEAKER_04]: Dutch stuff I really didn't focus a lot on
Americans at the time because I just
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't I wasn't hit to it, you know I
hadn't right when I came in I wasn't hit
[SPEAKER_04]: to the fact that all those dudes were
white labeling and most the Americans are
[SPEAKER_04]: making their seeds or Spanish or actually
back then I don't even know who was making
[SPEAKER_04]: the motherfucker seeds, you know,
right but yeah, I mean It was very
[SPEAKER_04]: different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean Greenhouse hadn't been totally
trashed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was still kind of under the radar for
New people at the time that that they were
[SPEAKER_04]: doing anything, you know untoward DNA was
massive during those years They were why I
[SPEAKER_04]: started doing six seeds a pack Because
their shit was six seeds a pack and they
[SPEAKER_04]: were the ones selling the most so I was
like, okay I guess that's what you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and then sub cool, of course had
just started fucking taking off and I was
[SPEAKER_04]: fortunate that I met Sonny Chiba Very
early on so I learned very quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, maybe that guy isn't someone I should
be looking at for breeding tips,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know Right, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took me a while, but I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's it was it was a much
different tape Yeah, it's interesting then
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's kind of when everybody
first came out of the shadows Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can walk out of the shadows with
any stories you wanted About yourself or
[SPEAKER_03]: the strains or whatever else and a lot of
times you were the only person You know
[SPEAKER_03]: from Sam Skunkman on Yeah, you were the
only you were the only person telling the
[SPEAKER_03]: story about those strengths Right,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean you remember, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: The audience was so small finding people
who are actually there, you know was was
[SPEAKER_04]: very difficult Yeah, it was it was a lot
smaller than now I just don't you think
[SPEAKER_04]: people that came later can grasp how small
the community was mm-hmm and how slow
[SPEAKER_03]: information was Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's pretty rapid fire Right,
you know and a lot of people connect all
[SPEAKER_03]: the time Oh, yeah, somebody said crunch
bubble, you know That guy I mean he that
[SPEAKER_03]: guy used to move massive amounts of what
was it blue dot?
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the third floor in Oakland,
you know, he had all those warehouses of
[SPEAKER_03]: 600 watt HPS is on hydro tables Bumping
out a bunch of stuff for third floor,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it was you know What what's funny
about that guy is that some of those
[SPEAKER_03]: pictures?
[SPEAKER_03]: Were like some of the first warehouse
scenes that people were willing to like
[SPEAKER_03]: throw up on IG on on the internet Yeah,
most people were growing in closets or
[SPEAKER_03]: bedrooms or greenhouses or in the woods or
wherever and all of a sudden you see a 40
[SPEAKER_03]: lighter Right and for a lot of people that
was the first time Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might look rudimentary now Yeah now but
yeah, but even just then in oh five or oh
[SPEAKER_03]: six or something like that, you know
finding people and I think too that like
[SPEAKER_03]: what most people don't understand maybe is
that a lot of the a lot of the breeders
[SPEAKER_03]: like that got famous later like a couple
people on the show or whatever like almost
[SPEAKER_03]: all the breeders were European or American
or Canadian?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right and the people that were
working Breeding in America.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're generally doing it through
friendship circles There was a lot there
[SPEAKER_03]: was a lot of trading and via DM amongst
friends And amongst contemporaries it
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't like like on you know, at least
from what I remember it wasn't like Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a big drop coming next Friday
Here's the fifth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the names.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made up for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the hybrids Here's where you can
get them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's how we're gonna sell them all It
was like, you know You trade seeds when
[SPEAKER_03]: you saw people or people were trading
selling them via DM or something like that
[SPEAKER_04]: like but it was different I remember As
far as Americans went there was not a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of Americans doing direct sales on
websites You would never really see that
[SPEAKER_04]: like it was all done, you know DMS or like
on weird little auction sites that were
[SPEAKER_04]: floating around but other than that There
wasn't a really good way to market
[SPEAKER_04]: yourself as an American breeder without
mostly giving seeds away to people I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: did you have that experience CSI?
[SPEAKER_01]: I I didn't get involved in any of I wanted
to back in the 06 08 era.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked into it But You know,
I was still way too paranoid to do any of
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I Should have done it, you know,
like, you know DNA and sub cool and hell
[SPEAKER_01]: even swerve, you know, yeah You know,
I mean all those guys, you know made huge
[SPEAKER_01]: names because there wasn't competition
Yeah, there's no competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't really have to have a whole lot
of talent to be very successful Someone
[SPEAKER_04]: just said mr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soul handled all of SSC in the 80s Well,
I mean what's interesting about that is
[SPEAKER_03]: that you know, there's been a lot there's
been a lot of talk about American SSC,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and you know Matt and myself got to
interview the owner who was very cool and
[SPEAKER_03]: You know all that kind of stuff got put to
rest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah hard there wasn't there wasn't any
American help No, but that for maneuver,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it goes but it goes to show how you
know in our world You can kind of step out
[SPEAKER_03]: of the shadows and be like, oh,
I mean there was a lot of people That you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, they came out of the shadows and
they were the first time that people were
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, oh, I'm I this is my cut
Yeah, and then it turns out that they just
[SPEAKER_03]: got the cut early Yeah, but they got a few
years of like oh if you want to use my cut
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to give me 50% of the proceeds of
the seeds or you got to pay me Or you got
[SPEAKER_03]: a this or you got a that it's my work It's
my my my my and then it comes out later
[SPEAKER_03]: that they just got it from these other
people early But they were the first one
[SPEAKER_03]: to go public Right, you know and a lot of
times what happened is is that the first
[SPEAKER_03]: person to go public?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know got credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Yeah, you know, you know they got
credit and their story was the story for a
[SPEAKER_03]: minute and sometimes other people would
get upset and get online and start You
[SPEAKER_03]: know, I mean, I actually think that's kind
of what got you know, you were talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about chem That's kind of what got chem
online Was you know skunk V a got online a
[SPEAKER_03]: bit?
[SPEAKER_03]: you know and started talking about
different things and Then people were
[SPEAKER_03]: like, oh my weeds famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should talk about it And then that got
and then that got that got Joe brand and
[SPEAKER_03]: and p-bud and other people that hadn't
really met met up or like even linked or
[SPEAKER_03]: even realized what was going on after 15
years to connect right because the stories
[SPEAKER_01]: 707 seed bank Shahbud.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the one who you know got a skunk VA
on to overgrow and I see mag to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: post about that stuff Otherwise,
I think there'd be a completely different
[SPEAKER_01]: chem dog history.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, if he hadn't done that,
you know Do we remember what the very very
[SPEAKER_04]: first claim of the chem dog seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily the first one people
remember but the very first Claims of chem
[SPEAKER_04]: dog who is the first one to claim that
string was it even Greg or were there
[SPEAKER_04]: other people popping up?
[SPEAKER_04]: As it was getting popular going that's
mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm bread that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember anybody claiming it Lots
of people claiming they have the 91 or oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure It was just like well,
I don't know how all these different cuts
[SPEAKER_04]: could be the right one Oh, you know
because it's purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you know when it perps I saw a
few chem dog cats and they they Some of
[SPEAKER_01]: them look like mass super skunk chem dogs
Yeah, but that just basically means
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody bought some weed that it was was
called chem dog and it had some seeds in
[SPEAKER_01]: it and Whatever had pollinated that chem
dog, you know chem dogs not a bad
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphrodite just by itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean not so yeah you know and So usually
if you find seeds in your chem dog,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's been pollinated by
something else Yeah Well, there was there
[SPEAKER_03]: was also a thing too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was there was really confusing I
think and this isn't anything against Greg
[SPEAKER_03]: or chem dog, but you know, it's it's like
for people that want specific lineages He
[SPEAKER_03]: was pretty famous for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you buy weed, you're buying chem dog
weed from chem dog It didn't really matter
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly what it was It was weed from chem
dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that created confusion too
because everyone was like, oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's this one specific thing You know But
it really was chem dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just branding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean back then branding was branding,
you know, it was it was it was early It
[SPEAKER_03]: was an early form of branding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah sure You know and people weren't and
a lot of these guys were young and nobody
[SPEAKER_03]: knew Especially then when things first
started getting famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anybody knew that some of
these strains were gonna be so lastingly
[SPEAKER_03]: famous Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of times they wrote down various
stories or this or that and they didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: really expect it to get become part of
Canon or become part of the the fabric of
[SPEAKER_03]: the tail and Then they have to look back
and defend it and you know And you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's hard for people sometimes to say,
you know, my memory was a little that's
[SPEAKER_03]: what I remembered at the time You know
after more after more information came out
[SPEAKER_03]: and I talked to more friends I've kind of
revised a little bit because other people
[SPEAKER_03]: had it's hard for people to say that a lot
of times you would dig in their heels
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and then you've got two or three or
four Versions of the story and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to figure out which one works Which
one is the most believable?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, you know, what's what's your
favorite while this story?
[SPEAKER_04]: From the forum errors that you knew I mean
you that that you knew was kind of like
[SPEAKER_04]: that's too fucking stupid to even be
possible Do you have any that stick out
[SPEAKER_04]: where you're like that was a bold fucking
claim and really won't wonky What comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: mind when I say that Okay, so I hate to
keep bringing up my boy swerve It doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really have a whole lot to do with him But
the guy he got pretty much most all of his
[SPEAKER_01]: early og cuts from in 06 07 This guy Had
an account on IC mag and then he made up
[SPEAKER_01]: another account and I think this was in 07
and He made up another account pretending
[SPEAKER_01]: to be his own mentor, you know with all
the same spelling errors all the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know type styles all that and He made
a whole thread on it and acted like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know He was the original creator of the og
Kush blah blah blah and his boy right here
[SPEAKER_01]: his little student You know, he's he's
best student I ever had We're of our boy
[SPEAKER_01]: and we hooked him up we laced him with all
those Cuts we've held since the 80s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh gee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that there's still that story on on a
icy mat It's still like God, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm I'm up in there with a bunch of
other clowns just laughing away You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that that one right there was it was
pretty much the tops for for me back in
[SPEAKER_01]: those days I got one for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one for you little old lady with
Asian fantasy Oh, that was a really good
[SPEAKER_01]: one, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like was a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Yeah, that one was was a there was a
strength called Asian fantasy made famous
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I think it's fair to say about the
Canna Bible Jason King pretty much made
[SPEAKER_04]: that strain very much So yeah known it
wasn't a well-known strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think was it No, no, no,
and you know He he talked about the rarity
[SPEAKER_04]: and how this guy never lets it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blah blah blah two years later A person
that we we know who it was, but I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: think he'll ever admit it right went on
and tried to say that she was the the wife
[SPEAKER_04]: of the man who held Asian fantasy and he
has died and she wants to get those
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics out there, you know and ended up
I think it's pretty sure it was NYC kid
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of big upping himself trying to give
himself some provenance on a cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never had access to Well, we don't
honestly we don't know that part of it
[SPEAKER_01]: because Who have you or anybody ever seen
this Asian fantasy keyword fantasy?
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of the Canna Bible and NYC kid and
his crew no, I mean It's kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: fantasy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact African black magic I mean,
there's some there's some pictures of it
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever but I mean Jason King even
talked about how homie wouldn't give it
[SPEAKER_03]: out to anyone and You know was it was a
massive hoarder of it, you know And so
[SPEAKER_03]: there's an aspect to it there too where
it's like people people can hoard
[SPEAKER_03]: something so much that it doesn't become
famous Yeah, right, you know because
[SPEAKER_03]: nobody ever sees it like before before
this forum time that you were talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about there was probably like You know
four or five people or something in
[SPEAKER_04]: California that had the chem 91 Someone
just said I have Asian fantasy s ones from
[SPEAKER_04]: th gobs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we still doing it go NYC kid you go,
but yeah, I mean it was like one of those
[SPEAKER_03]: things where like if you know if if OG
Kush if some of the if some of these
[SPEAKER_03]: famous things don't slip out and People
don't start cropping them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there was an aspect where it was
like for a long time There was only four
[SPEAKER_03]: or five garages pumping chem 91 Yeah,
like every you know, so how much weed is
[SPEAKER_03]: that not very much?
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't really give you very much
opportunity to try it doesn't really get
[SPEAKER_03]: give you an opportunity for like a fad to
You know like if OG hadn't snuck out if
[SPEAKER_03]: all those guys hadn't been money hungry
down there in LA and it snuck out It
[SPEAKER_03]: probably wouldn't have had that kind of
impact Yeah, because it has to be there
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be able to get that even even
if you have to pay a lot for it You do
[SPEAKER_03]: have to be able to access it Mm-hmm,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So Asian fantasy is one of those things
where like it, you know It never got out
[SPEAKER_03]: and then so as a result of that it allowed
scammer To be like this is it All right,
[SPEAKER_03]: and how could you tell the difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, um You know you still you still
buddies with the with old Jason Mr. King.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I haven't spoken to him in a minute,
but we're cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he lives on Maui I know I wonder if
you can ask him Kind of maybe some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: cuz I talked to him before I like met you
met you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah You know he He uh He affirmed that
you know, all my information was right and
[SPEAKER_01]: then he was like, where'd you where'd you
find all this stuff out?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean he might know some some
background details that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely didn't make it into the book
about that one of them one I've been
[SPEAKER_03]: actually thinking about reaching out and
talking to one because one of the things
[SPEAKER_03]: that's interesting is that he probably has
a shit ton of pictures of weed from myself
[SPEAKER_03]: and my Some and friends and then people
that I don't know obviously too,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that didn't make it in the book Yeah,
because you know, you might take you know
[SPEAKER_03]: dozens or hundreds of pictures or
something and then to make it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: you pick a couple You know and and all
that but he You know, and I think I think
[SPEAKER_03]: the Asian fantasy that he was talking
about was in Hawaii I want to say I
[SPEAKER_04]: remember and I could be totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe I shouldn't say I think I think
Bodhi knows the Asian fantasy person maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: I Might be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm asking I mean to me, it's one of the
it's it's one of those like legendary
[SPEAKER_03]: strains, you know, yeah that like just
never I mean, you know, there's I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: mention another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any of you guys have any any Experience
with Elvis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, but I don't know if it was I don't
know how real it was it was just a Cut
[SPEAKER_03]: called Elvis because there's some really
famous stuff out there that just it was
[SPEAKER_03]: never in my crew never in like the
extended circles of crews and you hear
[SPEAKER_03]: about them for a long time and it got
famous in various aspects, but it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: like You know, I also thought I had Albert
Walker too, though So there is that you
[SPEAKER_04]: know, like who knows who knows never got
it from a good source that they could say
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, this is where I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: None of that shit I passed off to skunk
bastard flex and I don't think you back to
[SPEAKER_01]: that and Your Albert Walker was the
orangey one, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, they go Walker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it'll day go.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um Did you ever see the mothership come
through I can't remember if you said yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh-huh Yeah, so I told this story before
but like it got mailed to one of our
[SPEAKER_03]: spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jason King's I don't think it's shade
to say this but His girlfriend at the time
[SPEAKER_03]: was this chick named Rebecca.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and she was from Asheville area of
North Carolina And so she you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: he used to rave about that cut all the
time And so she finally got some of her
[SPEAKER_03]: friends to send it to us Yeah,
right and dude it was like our buddy high
[SPEAKER_03]: and lonesome has a terrible story but It
was kind of like that in the sense where I
[SPEAKER_03]: was expecting to get this tiny little box
with some clones And we got this box that
[SPEAKER_03]: was like, you know this big by two feet
tall or whatever And it was two mothership
[SPEAKER_03]: plants in one gallon pots with steaks and
each one was about 18 inches tall And oh
[SPEAKER_03]: three or something like that and it was
like so all those pictures in the Canna
[SPEAKER_03]: Bible that you see of mothership Those all
came from those two moms that got mailed
[SPEAKER_03]: to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and then we mom those out and You
know it got they got grown at Eddie leps
[SPEAKER_03]: and they got grown at very His friends
houses and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually had I actually I had the
mothership for four or five years,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think And It wasn't I think it was a
super unique plant It wasn't one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have it didn't have the nicest
flavor I didn't really like the flavor
[SPEAKER_03]: that much But it had a pretty cool high
and it did this weird thing where it would
[SPEAKER_03]: fall half over but then hold itself up So
like you know how most branches if they
[SPEAKER_03]: flop they flop It would like flop,
but then it would like raise itself up and
[SPEAKER_03]: it would grow sideways through your garden
hmm almost kind of a little like train
[SPEAKER_03]: wreck it would get would catch itself and
Just like and it had like these it was a
[SPEAKER_03]: really odd sativa It had thin leaves and
it was big branchy thing But you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean I honestly like compared to all the
other shit we've been talking about like
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubba's and Kems and you know super stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was a little midsy You know in
all reality, but it was one of those
[SPEAKER_03]: things that probably like was genetically
very different than everything else So I
[SPEAKER_04]: like I like you know, we like those weird
things Real quick to touch back on Elvis
[SPEAKER_04]: since you were you were on THC farmers
stuff for a long time, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or at least attentive to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was on the outskirts of the Devil's
Harvest crew back in those days too and
[SPEAKER_01]: There was there was some of those guys
that one Circulated through that crew a
[SPEAKER_01]: good bit and it it started I think Iraq
from maybe like I don't know if I should
[SPEAKER_01]: say a stay and it's a long time on You
know, I think he's he circulated Elvis for
[SPEAKER_01]: a while through there I wouldn't be
surprised if a doctor maybe had grown it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: He he was he was really Good buddies with
a lot of those cats and I mean the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: time I was I was online I only I only
traded cuts through the mail maybe I only
[SPEAKER_01]: received cuts through the mail twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Yeah, I you know 40 50 plus,
you know Packages of cuts by only received
[SPEAKER_01]: twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did all my other business just in person
up and down the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very I'm in person Miss Elvis from
the farm Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't very good on the farm at all Very
very little it was a person who showed
[SPEAKER_04]: like they were the main person showing the
the Elvis cut back then there was
[SPEAKER_04]: something called like the pink Cadillac
cut and then there was the Elvis cut
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's the only person I ever got
it from but I never They disappeared like
[SPEAKER_04]: not even a month after giving it to me But
they were the ones that were always
[SPEAKER_04]: documenting it on the farm But I never
knew if that was if it's just someone from
[SPEAKER_04]: that Bullshit and made their way through
because they disappeared so fast Was it
[SPEAKER_04]: super insensi, uh No, it was exactly like
what they talk about like a vinyl smell
[SPEAKER_04]: vinyl this artificial vinyl Hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah not insensi at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hurting One of the things that's
kind of interesting about that era too is
[SPEAKER_03]: it's kind of like the last era before like
the the clone name dominance thing started
[SPEAKER_03]: happening where Everyone's growing og or
everyone's growing sour or everyone's
[SPEAKER_03]: growing all that kind of stuff So there
was a lot of these odd strains,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, not odd in the sense that
there's anything wrong with them just odd
[SPEAKER_03]: odd Random strains that were easily sold,
you know, and so they they people liked
[SPEAKER_03]: them and they got traded Yeah,
you know people weren't looking
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily for like oh I need to get this
specific cut because I'm gonna be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: move it and it's gonna go for X price,
you know They were more interested in like
[SPEAKER_03]: the legend or the history or whatever of
said cut or the person behind it and you
[SPEAKER_03]: could get on there and start talking about
your cut and All of a sudden drum up a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of interest Yeah, and especially
like if we wanted to go back You know when
[SPEAKER_03]: we were talking about how small it was I
mean think about how revolutionary,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Just some some of Matt's favorite
some of blueberry stuff got you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and how it looked There wasn't that much
competition There wasn't that much stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: outside of Europe or shanty or sensei or
you know Simon from Sirius or some of that
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff like there wasn't that many American
breeders so the few people that were doing
[SPEAKER_03]: it like like mr soul or or DJ short or
whoever that were willing To to show their
[SPEAKER_03]: work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it kind of got like outsized You
know outsized impact You know like since
[SPEAKER_03]: Cindy 99 probably got way more famous than
it should have
[SPEAKER_03]: You know just to be just to be just to be
perfectly honest I don't think in today it
[SPEAKER_03]: would have the same lasting impact Right
now not today.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it wouldn't it wouldn't have it
wouldn't have been able to break through
[SPEAKER_04]: but it was like though I do think because
it is is like when you try to think of an
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoor plant That's fast enough and still
considered sativa to most people I think
[SPEAKER_04]: that it's it would be very hard to find a
replacement for c99.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that fast With those type of high
qualities and I think that also had a
[SPEAKER_04]: major Effect because it was it's a perfect
outdoor plant for blast and fast,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and it could be grown indoors I
just mean it got like all his work got
[SPEAKER_03]: real.
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't that much competition So
there was a lot of time to talk about you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, like not only Cindy 99 But like we
were like the genius or the Apollo this or
[SPEAKER_03]: that or whatever or like, you know
Everybody got plenty of time to debate the
[SPEAKER_03]: four or five things that DJ released Yeah,
because there just wasn't that there
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't that many different things You
know, there wasn't that many now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's there's thousands of breeders
Standing out is very hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it was like, you know, what was what
was there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know a dozen big people doing
stuff Yeah, it was a lot easier for people
[SPEAKER_04]: to fucking keep other people down too Like
the ones at the top since it wasn't a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of competition and they held a lot of sway
They could really cut fucker's throats
[SPEAKER_04]: real fast and it happened a lot too and it
was A lot easier to do that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have probably got cut then if I
had even tried to start back then Dude,
[SPEAKER_04]: I like I said, I was banned off every
forum and it got to the point where I was
[SPEAKER_04]: like fuck this I'm gonna start my own
forum like mr.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never got banned from I got asked to
leave after a pitch picture contest
[SPEAKER_04]: because the the right Barry pictures beat
out one of mr Nice's and he thought that
[SPEAKER_04]: was kind of fucked of me to put it in But
yeah all the rest of them it was really
[SPEAKER_04]: hard because a lot of the ones a lot of
people that were running those forums also
[SPEAKER_04]: had a seed company and most of those seed
banks and seed companies would eventually
[SPEAKER_04]: start fucking people and If you were one
of those people to speak up Good you're
[SPEAKER_04]: done.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they don't want you around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I I see mag definitely had some of
that aspect to it too Yeah, there was the
[SPEAKER_03]: in crowd and the out crowd, you know for
sure as far as that goes I'm just Out for
[SPEAKER_01]: him is still alive after everything that
went on with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah See people somebody talked about that
people talk about 89 super skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an 89 super skunk One of the
things that gets that that annoys the hell
[SPEAKER_03]: out of me Honestly, and this isn't to call
out whoever has 89 super skunk But just in
[SPEAKER_03]: general is like they'll take the first
year that something was ever released or
[SPEAKER_03]: named and be like I have that weed from a
year or two before then Yeah, that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: big right like so the first time super
skunk ever got used was in the 1990 seed
[SPEAKER_03]: bank catalog Yeah, that's when it had a
picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when it had a name.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when Neville released it You know
and so people are like, oh, I've got the
[SPEAKER_03]: 89 super skunk You know and then they're
like, oh, you know, then they got to come
[SPEAKER_03]: up with like well, you know It was all
that pre-release special shit cuz I my
[SPEAKER_03]: uncle was buddies with homie who?
[SPEAKER_03]: Gave it down on special kickdown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they'll be like, you know,
you know, I got that ninety-five
[SPEAKER_04]: ninety-three sensei star I actually have
pictures of that 1989 super skunk and they
[SPEAKER_04]: look awful cookie ish.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty pretty It happens all the time
and then you see a lot of these old cuts
[SPEAKER_03]: right now the years keep getting earlier
and earlier Yeah You know, I mean one
[SPEAKER_03]: thing and this isn't you know,
this isn't it, you know, obviously boaties
[SPEAKER_03]: use this or whatever else, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is no g-13 hash plant in the 88
catalogs No, no, it came out in the 89
[SPEAKER_03]: catalog for the first year 89 and 90 You
know, but 88 is much better.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds nice You know, and I'm not
trying to throw any shade on it or
[SPEAKER_03]: anything like that There's plenty of
people that have found nice weed and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know buddy made a bunch of hybrids with it
and it came from NDN guy I think right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Originally originally or whatever,
you know, he reproduced it, but it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: it got released in 89 Yeah, but everyone
calls it the great, you know the 88 Right
[SPEAKER_03]: close enough, you know all the details
those that you know Some of that first
[SPEAKER_03]: piff some of that first stuff they talk
about They'll call it the great 88 Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: that shit got released in 89 So there's a
bunch of stuff out there where people will
[SPEAKER_03]: be like this cut is from a year or two
before this line ever Got released.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a quick question though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I have zero experience in this
because I was living in my you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: whole and humble but You were there so Or
maybe maybe you were there years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the possibility of them doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: releases of their seeds At the canvas cups
So that so that is It is possible like for
[SPEAKER_03]: instance the first cannabis cup I went to
the which the Jack Herrera cup And the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole thing was themed on him,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and it was all about like it was
the whole like all the festivities were
[SPEAKER_03]: all about the Emperor wears no clothes and
They released Jack Herrera seeds You know
[SPEAKER_03]: from in 95 94 yeah 95 they released them
but they it was you know, it was late
[SPEAKER_03]: November Right, but it wasn't in the
catalog till the following year Right,
[SPEAKER_03]: so it was like literally it was literally
the first time for instance Jack was
[SPEAKER_03]: dropped was at the camp was at the
cannabis cup Right in late November.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I suppose you could have gotten it Jack
Herrera at least six weeks before the year
[SPEAKER_01]: turned Right, right, you know,
I mean For example, Salmon Creek Big Bud
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know homeboy homeboy from
Salmon Creek, you know He bought those
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds at the cup the year it won the cup
and then smuggled 50 of those seeds home
[SPEAKER_01]: and his little belt, you know,
hi hideaway belt thing and That's you know
[SPEAKER_01]: his selection from those Sensey Big Bud
seeds or whatever is what made Salmon
[SPEAKER_01]: Creek Big Bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean that's that's Definitely possible a
lot of times a lot of new seed releases
[SPEAKER_03]: Would get dumped in late November then
because because it was like an industry
[SPEAKER_03]: gathering Right, and there was tons of and
honestly there was tons of custies there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Ended up hating going to Amsterdam for
the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went three times and then never again
Mostly because it sucked And the reason it
[SPEAKER_03]: sucked was that Amsterdam is pretty far
north and So it's cold as shit in late
[SPEAKER_03]: November there, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can go in summer and it's nice and
it's beautiful and you're on a bicycle and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're cruising around all stoned or you
can go when it's sleeting and 29 degrees
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not as nice, you know,
and then all the best weed would get saved
[SPEAKER_03]: for celebrities that were coming in And
who's who so there was worse weed to get
[SPEAKER_03]: because it was all getting saved for You
know Snoop Dogg or you know Sam skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: man's friends or you know, whoever whoever
the high times crew or whatnot and then on
[SPEAKER_03]: top of that You could buy tickets to go to
the cannabis cup out of high times Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you go to Europe on vacation and the
coffee shops are full with all these dudes
[SPEAKER_03]: from Jersey and New York Yeah screaming
about wanting to get the best bud in the
[SPEAKER_03]: world So it's like you fly 12 hours away
from your house And you're surrounded by a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of obnoxious East coasters And
there's not as good weed and it's crowded
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's cold and it's raining or it's
snowing and it's like I much preferred
[SPEAKER_03]: going there in summer You know just
because it was nice and chill You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it was like an event that was like the
it was it was an event then you know And
[SPEAKER_03]: you know really like the story goes,
you know Neville didn't even want to
[SPEAKER_03]: release Jack Herrera that year.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't think it He didn't think he
didn't think it was done, but they wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: something new and hot that they could call
Jack Herrera And isn't the story of
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking Cindy 99 that it fucking dude
bought Jack Herrera in a coffee shop and
[SPEAKER_03]: found seeds in it Yep, and then took him
home and started his whole cubing fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: princess Whatever thing that he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think Rick did anything like that
Yeah, you know he found bag seed in a in
[SPEAKER_03]: buds that he bought at a coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep Mm-hmm, you know or be 99 and genius
or or both?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack Herrera at best hybrids Yeah,
and really like and you know, I think back
[SPEAKER_03]: then that was even earlier like we weren't
using the improper term back cross yet or
[SPEAKER_03]: you know BX Well, they were talking about
fucking Wasn't it cubing?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was it was he was cubing you were
cubing it you were like Fucking and they
[SPEAKER_03]: had all those like long-winded posts on on
fucking the forums about what percentage
[SPEAKER_03]: and how much it was Increasing with every
one you did and laying it all out,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, yeah There was some really bad
breeder tech being shared that seemed
[SPEAKER_04]: cutting edge at the time Mm-hmm,
you know still repeat that fucking shit
[SPEAKER_04]: Like like a mantra.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're gonna back cross it four times
and you get that's as good as an s1 That's
[SPEAKER_03]: a clone and I saw and I saw somebody
talking about I like the super silver haze
[SPEAKER_03]: better than the Jack Herrera the whole
reason super state silver haze exists is
[SPEAKER_03]: because Neville didn't feel like the Jack
Herrera project was ready for primetime He
[SPEAKER_03]: just released it due to you know Alan and
Ben drunkers from sensei were businessmen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when he left he kept working on it
And then a couple years later,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in 97 or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wrote they released mango and Neville
and super silver haze Because he felt like
[SPEAKER_03]: we know they'd actually gotten somewhere
Right, right, right, but they still did a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple and I actually think that was the
last big release the Neville ever did
[SPEAKER_03]: right But I mean I smoked that that super
silver haze cut because to I went in 90 I
[SPEAKER_03]: was basically like every other year like I
went 97 and 99 to to the Cups and those
[SPEAKER_03]: last two cups that super silver haze was
all over the place Because that way that
[SPEAKER_03]: was in that was like the first and third
year at one It was like the hot shit over
[SPEAKER_00]: there Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really was it was the hot shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean it was super there was a phenol of
it that went like 14 weeks Will the
[SPEAKER_03]: community let rez back into play?
[SPEAKER_03]: Rez is doing his own thing, you know what
most people don't know about rez And our
[SPEAKER_03]: are a couple of buddies remind reminded me
of not that long ago was like Before all
[SPEAKER_03]: the bullshit with the with the law
enforcement and all that He was a dick
[SPEAKER_03]: online anyway Right big time.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a big-time troll jerk Generally a
pain in the ass to get along with not a
[SPEAKER_03]: pleasant homie Yeah, despite despite any
of the rest of the bull whatever you want
[SPEAKER_03]: to believe about You know all the mess
that happened Legally or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he was a he was an early troll
Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a jackass.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a huge ego Yeah, I mean he still
does He had a decent level of intelligence
[SPEAKER_01]: Which would have been I think much more
appreciated if we hadn't had so much ego
[SPEAKER_03]: with it Yeah, a little you middle,
you know, I mean not you know a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: ego and a bunch of rudeness You know,
there was some root there was some rude
[SPEAKER_03]: people you could be Put up with a little
bit better, but they were like borderline
[SPEAKER_03]: geniuses Right, right, right, you know,
like Tom Hill could be a real dick if you
[SPEAKER_03]: asked a dumb question You know or Sam
skunk man he could be a dick too because
[SPEAKER_03]: you know you get tired of I've told the
same story five billion times Right,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're gonna question me You're 23.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a cocksucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, yeah eat my dick You know
basically You know rude rude kind of rude,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, but it's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to have patience You know and
let's face it right a lot of us are
[SPEAKER_03]: weirdos a lot of us don't have the
greatest interpersonal skills to begin
[SPEAKER_03]: with I Mean speaking for me, I probably
have a little bit more than your average
[SPEAKER_03]: grower Yeah, you know, but a lot but a lot
of them it's like, you know, we're Kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: harsh edges people that live in the hills
Don't talk to people hang out with plants
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're really good with plants and
they're not so good with social
[SPEAKER_03]: interaction So you put those people on the
forums and you put those people like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know on IG or whatever and it's like
it's not the easiest thing I did have an
[SPEAKER_04]: adjustment period that I will admit I had
an adjustment period of where I May have
[SPEAKER_04]: been a little meaner in responses and
talking to people Little snappy maybe a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit of ego You know it happens,
but some of us grow into beautiful smiling
[SPEAKER_04]: faces like this I'm also still banned from
Breed Bay for Picking on sub cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also it's also the way I look at it
is like, you know I mean everybody has the
[SPEAKER_03]: natural inclination sometimes but it's
like are you trying to get your point
[SPEAKER_03]: across you trying to fucking argue on it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here's this dude who says his dad
created dog, but I remember that guy He's
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to dock to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm gonna balk him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there you go I mean the thing the
thing about the one thing we'll say about
[SPEAKER_03]: dog, but and then we'll move on is that
Joe brand and Peabody we're buying and
[SPEAKER_03]: selling weed on dead tour all the time for
cash to go see dead shows, right then this
[SPEAKER_03]: one weekend they sold some weed and then
they mailed Greg some more weed and Then
[SPEAKER_03]: 15 years went by before they even heard
anything cool came out of it Mm-hmm Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They literally they never saw chem 91 or
anything like that until oh six until the
[SPEAKER_03]: reunion When the forums got people back
together, they had no idea They were on
[SPEAKER_03]: dead tour, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They met they this, you know, you know,
these got Greg was in it was a teenager
[SPEAKER_03]: from the East Coast and they sold him some
weed in Indiana Mm-hmm, right which was
[SPEAKER_03]: just one stop on summer tour And you're
buying pounds and you're selling eighths
[SPEAKER_03]: and quarters and halves and ounces and it
ran out and you buy some other Pounds and
[SPEAKER_03]: you just keep doing that and you did that
for a while and one of these sales turned
[SPEAKER_00]: into something Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you want to hey 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was summer On dead tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember this one couple pounds you
had that you were hustling for like a
[SPEAKER_03]: weekend?
[SPEAKER_03]: You have any clear memory of that because
it's kind of important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I think I think you might have
remembered just because he Hit Joe brand
[SPEAKER_01]: up, you know Gee hit hit Joe brand up
again and had him mail him some more weed
[SPEAKER_03]: I think who else right who ounces and we
don't even know if the seeds came from the
[SPEAKER_03]: deer Creek show Or the seeds came from the
weed that Joe sent him later It's I from
[SPEAKER_01]: based on the stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've kind of deciphered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it It came from the ones that was
sent that one had no seeds But then again,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know G's stories are a little up and
down I mean, you know not to I like two of
[SPEAKER_03]: my favorite cuts of all time come out of
G's little rooms, but I will say that all
[SPEAKER_03]: of us on this thing have tried to Have
tried to interpret what he meant by
[SPEAKER_03]: rejuvenating the 91 after it got tired in
night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Well, I'm always moving Adam
Rejuvenate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah The rejuvenation he had to let it go
and rejuvenate it From seed and that shit
[SPEAKER_03]: never got explained You know And so I
don't you know, there's when it when any
[SPEAKER_03]: time you have a situation where you know
We can even go back and take you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like ancient, you know ancient Virginia
skunk bud grown for SSC or Mr. Soul,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know working for SSC, you know,
you you create these ancient legends and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's Like how do you disprove them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah in a lot of cases you can't prove or
disprove because they're so old Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's get back to the forums.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah What was the first place?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember where the first like seed
bank the first seed bank that carried your
[SPEAKER_04]: shit when people could actually buy it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't talk about that And unmentionable
I ain't friends with that guy Dude a
[SPEAKER_01]: little loco.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha You got to remember I didn't even
Start my seed company until 2014.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember yeah, I mean I could say
one thing is that my buddy that I never
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned his name but Staten Island when
we were doing all the Superdog work and we
[SPEAKER_03]: were doing all those hybrids that made it
into the Canna Bible he had big dreams of
[SPEAKER_03]: Realizing that you could probably make
more money like off of an eight lighter of
[SPEAKER_03]: seed Then you could off an eight lighter
of flower and he saw what was coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly didn't believe him You know,
I didn't think I didn't think that we you
[SPEAKER_03]: would ever be able in America to like
package up and sell enormous amounts of
[SPEAKER_03]: seed or anything like that because at the
time we were making all this stuff and we
[SPEAKER_03]: were literally giving it away to good
friends and stuff because We had more than
[SPEAKER_03]: we knew what to do with and there wasn't
an outlet for it You know the era that
[SPEAKER_03]: that Caleb talks about getting involved is
one of the earlier eras where you could
[SPEAKER_03]: really Actually start to sell it It wasn't
simple in the beginning even even if you
[SPEAKER_03]: were an active breeder Finding out how to
get it to the community wasn't very
[SPEAKER_03]: simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: No You had to trust I mean like even even
with me I started the Selling seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: directly really early for for a US person
but when I first started you still had to
[SPEAKER_04]: Really put your trust in someone in Europe
for the most part if you wanted any kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of traction for your seeds if you wanted
any I mean you had to work with seed banks
[SPEAKER_04]: for people they Eventually know who you
are to see bank didn't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: You you probably weren't fucking important
We were about to go into CSI after dark
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but yeah, I mean, you know a good
bit of that was in the 90s You know when
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ short wanted to get his blueberry seed
out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had to give it away to Two different
groups in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah first he had to give it to Tony at
SAG Martha and then he had to give it to
[SPEAKER_04]: Dutch Passion I don't know if he
intentionally gave it away, but I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how it ended up working out Didn't
didn't he Purposely give them to him and
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe purposely did I think he thought
that he would still retain all Control and
[SPEAKER_03]: this and that that's where he was probably
mistaken But in order for him to even like
[SPEAKER_03]: get money for his seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had to send them to an established seed
bank Yeah in a different continent That's
[SPEAKER_03]: how hard it was to move seeds that Yeah,
but you know when he I think SAG Martha
[SPEAKER_03]: they had his seeds and what like,
you know the mid 90s or something like
[SPEAKER_03]: that Right around there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah internet didn't even exist then
really Right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did but not not any level that you were
gonna be able to use it for that Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, I think overgrowth started in either
98 or 99 Well, yeah, yeah now you're right
[SPEAKER_03]: about that so like the first forums the
first being able to Exchange stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: how would DJ have even set up and internet
was gonna set up a geo cities like fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: You know web page and sell illegal beans
You know, I mean up until up until they
[SPEAKER_03]: passed the the 215 and in late 96 I think
it was it was you it was illegal in all 50
[SPEAKER_03]: states There wasn't any there wasn't even
a legitimate reason you could possess any
[SPEAKER_03]: of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah And I think he feels burnt he felt
Burned but you know, what were you gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: do when you gave it away to the Dutch?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right if he didn't know that those those
Dutch guys were gonna do whatever the fuck
[SPEAKER_03]: they wanted with it Then he was just he
had just done his groundwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Well, yeah, that's a Blueberry is
almost a Full day's topic just by itself
[SPEAKER_03]: it is but I just meant in the sense that
like just to use it on the example of how
[SPEAKER_03]: Hard it was to sell seeds if you were a
small American breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah He had to work with the Dutch just to
get it out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't an avenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were you gonna do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know You know even like early
even early American, you know seed sellers
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever used to try to fake That their
stuff was based out of Europe Right,
[SPEAKER_03]: right Right You know, I I mean one of the
things that IG did and and the middle and
[SPEAKER_03]: and the sort of the middle era of two
middle late 215 was things opened up
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough that people felt free To be able to
like, you know, you could have a swamp
[SPEAKER_03]: boys You could have a CSI Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could have a you could have just these
people that were like I'm gonna make my
[SPEAKER_03]: own packaging I'm gonna make my own beans.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna go to these like gray area
cannabis cup swap meats and Hustle seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna start to mail I can say back in
0203 0405 I mean my buddy from Staten
[SPEAKER_03]: Island would tell me about this stuff that
he wanted to do and I would laugh at him I
[SPEAKER_03]: was like, oh you want us to all go to
jail?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's what you that's what it
seems like you're talking about to me,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know Yeah, when I started I I was one
of the people I think I was one of the few
[SPEAKER_04]: people that pretended that my website was
in Amsterdam just to like Try to hide
[SPEAKER_04]: under the shadows, you know, just cuz no
one was doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It fucking was a big red flag So even
waiting for that hit even having the
[SPEAKER_03]: infrastructure set up to be successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and and that's kind of Why there was
so few breeders back then?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was generally done out of love
and you were trading amongst other people
[SPEAKER_03]: and there wasn't something like there is
now where somebody can be like Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna drop my Mac one drop and I'm
gonna make 200 grand that it you know I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna hype it Yeah,
you really couldn't hype it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't an ability to reach a big
audience Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think You know It took a while
Well in in in the era, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh six, you know through oh eight even
2010 I mean most of the marketing most
[SPEAKER_01]: most of the availability was all based on
Internet forums, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know that was yeah, and people
should also remember that when overgrown
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis world got shut down They got shut
down because a very big, you know seed
[SPEAKER_03]: vendor got rated Heaven stairway I was and
that scared a bunch of people And there's
[SPEAKER_04]: still repercussions and ripples hitting
from that fucking bust, you know And you
[SPEAKER_03]: know and then you know and and you know
and people even in Canada and stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that You know Mark Emory, you know,
I mean he he went to fucking he went to
[SPEAKER_04]: jail Did you have any dealings with Mark
Emory Caleb at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no interactions No interactions at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But uh, you know, I was getting Cannabis
culture or cannabis Canada from pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much like the first issue, you know,
I've always been a historian so I mean I
[SPEAKER_01]: have hundreds and hundreds of cannot books
and I was you know for years I was getting
[SPEAKER_01]: every single magazine that was put out on
On everything so I've always been way more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a reader than a talker Yeah,
you know it helps put details together
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah But no, no, no direct, you know
dealings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean The stuff I liked from from those
magazines though and and him were like the
[SPEAKER_01]: ABC stuff from back late 90s and then
Purple Indica purple Kush stuff that was
[SPEAKER_01]: in those early issues as well But uh,
and then Emory was working with the same
[SPEAKER_01]: purple indica that's around now or at
least a relative It wasn't Emory.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an article based out of
Snohomish County in Washington and It
[SPEAKER_01]: basically dated that that stuff back into
the you know at the very least,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know early mid 90s, you know,
so There was a question we were talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about the other night and I was like I
need to ask not so that and I can't
[SPEAKER_04]: remember It was it had something to do
with How did Kim do you make it to
[SPEAKER_03]: California not so oh, yeah, how did it
make it here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, who brought it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's pretty simple story.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it ties into the forums, so People
start in oh six people started getting
[SPEAKER_03]: excited about a chem dog And the chem dog
story because it started getting posted
[SPEAKER_03]: like Caleb was saying shot our Shaba got
got Skunk VA to start posting about his,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know recollections and different stuff
like that and and Then you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's kind of actually what started to
reunite People like Peabod and Joe Brand
[SPEAKER_03]: and Chem dog all they all started chatting
I believe they even called like the the
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds that ended up being the one through
four the reunion seeds or yeah The number
[SPEAKER_01]: four they named the reunion Fino specific
a reunion Fino That's what it was right
[SPEAKER_03]: because it was like they'd all they'd all
kind of met up as this You know like
[SPEAKER_03]: different people were like hey,
dude, they're talking about your story on
[SPEAKER_03]: the internet, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: and so Chem dog hadn't actually had the
chem 91 in quite a long time He had gotten
[SPEAKER_03]: in trouble and lost it and he had been
working with some of the chem dog Super
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk hybrids that he had and bags
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like if you bring it back to bring
it back to me and I've got this different
[SPEAKER_03]: one that you guys don't have out there and
I'll give it to you so he went back east
[SPEAKER_03]: and and saw a dude and gave him the and
gave him the dog and then Greg gave him
[SPEAKER_03]: the deep and he came back and mom did up
and that's how me and I see collective
[SPEAKER_03]: both guy So is it skunky a that did it
brought it out a percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was it It was him it was it was
all it's he's the reason it's he to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the reason it's on the west coast He
put forth the effort he went back east to
[SPEAKER_03]: see chem dog He gave he gave the dog to
chem dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got the D That was if I remember to I
believe that Chem dog tried to give him
[SPEAKER_03]: back the MSS.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he just said that but it was the
shorter one that was in the high times and
[SPEAKER_03]: it wasn't what Homie remembered it all
that makes a lot of sense, too Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: so then yeah, so then he came back and he
grew it up into a mom or whatever and then
[SPEAKER_03]: I see collective and myself got it not
that long after that and But to me,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like the reason it's on the west
coast is is skunk BA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well on Greg on G's tour He he dropped it
off in the you know, LA area with swerve
[SPEAKER_01]: the chem D in oh six, but this is off of
oh six he and Swerve traded him a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: fake cuts for it, you know a big deal and
then he stopped at he stopped at You know
[SPEAKER_01]: obsolete in Central Cal on his tour and
then he stopped at Joe Brands and then he
[SPEAKER_01]: headed up into Oregon and stopped at some
other folks place and I think he might
[SPEAKER_01]: have given them the chem D too,
but he he stopped at a good handful of
[SPEAKER_01]: places giving cuts out selling weed at
dispensaries all that kind of stuff on his
[SPEAKER_01]: You know reunion tour of sorts and this is
like first week of August oh six so it
[SPEAKER_01]: sounds like Skunk VA went over there,
you know earlier in the year and and and
[SPEAKER_01]: got The same or similar cut I don't know
Seems like there was a few cuts that got
[SPEAKER_01]: passed out that year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Yeah, I mean it so but that's that's
kind of that's how that's how that the and
[SPEAKER_03]: that led to a bunch of stuff that led to
the one two three four Getting popped and
[SPEAKER_03]: started to get traded around That led to
the D that led to the one through the four
[SPEAKER_03]: and the D and all that starting to get
added to the mix I don't know that the
[SPEAKER_03]: weird thing about the the chem stuff is
that my buddy Disliked the sis quite a
[SPEAKER_03]: bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He thought it was ugly and he didn't like
how it got him high So he never brought it
[SPEAKER_03]: west And so it never really percolated
around our crew You know we way later we
[SPEAKER_03]: saw some of the s wants But not the actual
not the actual first one, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah so But yeah, I mean that's and I you
know, I'm pretty sure You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: he I never lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never lost it after skunk gave it to me
Yeah, I mean that and that's that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of thing like, you know CSI and I
talk about it all the time It's like are
[SPEAKER_03]: there strains were like the chain of
custody wasn't broken
[SPEAKER_03]: Because once you lose the chain of custody
You know, it's hard Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets hard, you know, like Because who
knows, you know, you try to you lost the
[SPEAKER_03]: sour diesel you try to get it back It's
not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember you lost this you try to get
it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the same you remember You know so
on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know Kind of like when a 707
Shabbat got his bubba back from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I don't think I did it on purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got mixed up in a flat what cuz I was
bringing a ton of people a bunch of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: at a party and Then like a year later.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, yeah Inspectors bubba and I was
like, what's this inspectors buff and he
[SPEAKER_01]: had bomb threat not
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to give you you know, the fake
that's one well not fake but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, but yeah that happens all the time I
Think I'd take a bomb threat over over
[SPEAKER_01]: original maybe you can always get a new
bomb threat if you have that That's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good point, you know question for
you since uh, we kind of meandered away
[SPEAKER_04]: from the forum stuff, but Do you see a
side?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you do any work with Jesus?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you planning any work with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if I could find a mass super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah those for you to really I was telling
him last night that I think he should
[SPEAKER_04]: because I think it's a it's a rad clone
But it is it is very finicky and it does
[SPEAKER_04]: make it a lot harder to pull off reversals
on unhappy finicky shit Right,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would it would be really cool Attempt
to remake like a sour type from yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know building blocks I mean,
yeah, you know, we all have the the 91 But
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what building blocks,
you know, it might not have to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: exact thing But what could you get close
enough to?
[SPEAKER_01]: To make a sour diesel out of you know,
the original building blocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, I Think Jesus leans closer
to a sour type than it does a chem type
[SPEAKER_04]: personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm No, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a cool one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people want to hear something about
Irene.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what they want to hear about
Irene I think we've already told the story
[SPEAKER_04]: of Irene, but do you have any good Irene
tales?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean She's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think um, I Had Irene for a little bit
and didn't realize she was she was you
[SPEAKER_01]: know as as nice as she was until I think I
grew her outdoors in maybe 2008 I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking Yeah, I Don't want to fudge the
fudge the dates though But yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: she came out so nice back then You know
Good old-fashioned Atlanta Atlanta's
[SPEAKER_01]: finest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is a special one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean It doesn't have a whole whole
lot of a story, you know Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: just another bag seat really that's what
it goes boys down to is just another
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking bag seat The most humbling things
about breeding is That a lot of the most
[SPEAKER_03]: famous strains are total accidents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm Right, and you put a bunch of time
and work and effort into stuff and then
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Your air conditioner goes out and
some shit herms and the seat off of that
[SPEAKER_03]: is better than anything else You tried to
do a lot of times when it comes to like
[SPEAKER_03]: these stories The week the accidental weed
is so good It's what makes people want to
[SPEAKER_03]: try to like shoehorn in that they had some
intentional part of making it Not so much
[SPEAKER_03]: that I was just there or we got late.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to say well, I just got
lucky in my room They want to be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh well I did this and I did this and I
did this and then that happened and yet
[SPEAKER_04]: now it's all the weed that you all want
well Everybody's got to work their stud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that how it's done, you know,
but but really it was more like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know I was I had my room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ended up partying for a few days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucked off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I walked in there There was some bananas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found some seeds trimming That's like
99% of bag seed stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that that's kind of why I believe
Matt Matt burger and Josh D story because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a It's a herm, you know in a
little closet under the stairs story and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just like who makes that stuff Yeah,
you know I it that's very humbling but I
[SPEAKER_03]: also do think that a lot of that 90s weed
it just goes to show that when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: crossing things that like aren't When
you're crossing real fire, you know It's a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot easier to get you know, like was was
Neville an amazing Breeder or do you just
[SPEAKER_03]: get to get the best of the best from
America and cross it together for the
[SPEAKER_03]: first time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm saying there's an there's an
app.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's arguments to both He was you know,
he was the first person to cross and Ellen
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk Right, you know I was thinking you
should get Tom on and try to get figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out a little more details about pine tar
and all that kind of stuff cuz love to You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, I don't think he even knows who I am
to get him on or he's not likely III think
[SPEAKER_01]: he's banned off IC mag.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I mean, let me ask you like a
real question Do you think that he would
[SPEAKER_03]: be better for a live or do you think he
would be better for us a lightly edited?
[SPEAKER_03]: Podcast or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh probably a heavily edited podcast
Because I mean we definitely Matt and I
[SPEAKER_03]: have definitely interviewed some like
knowledgeable old-timers, right and like
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no Tom's the character I like him
but yeah Topic yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, so there's there is a question
Everybody is asking and it's up to you if
[SPEAKER_04]: you want to talk about I don't even know
if you want to deal with this one right
[SPEAKER_04]: now or Save it for a full episode Caleb
Backstory on Z.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man I don't want to like Say say yet
because yeah, let's say you want to save
[SPEAKER_01]: it for a full show of some sort later
Well, I still have some groans to do on
[SPEAKER_01]: that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, man I Wouldn't be surprised if
it's not just an s1 of That green sherbert
[SPEAKER_01]: cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah there's there's just too too many
similarities and The whole you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a heterozygous homozygous thing between
the two of them Really kind of leans
[SPEAKER_01]: towards it just being a s1 of that Yeah,
but I don't know um Yeah, I could go on
[SPEAKER_01]: and on on some comparisons on you know,
how some of that stuff could a Could
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially make sense Yeah, but I don't
know I don't know Yeah, we'll save it for
[SPEAKER_04]: another time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good answer one thing one thing
that is going about that is that CSI and I
[SPEAKER_03]: and Matt we all talk all the time about
how when you compare stories to what the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants tell you How they breed what their
s1s look like what what they look like
[SPEAKER_03]: when they get crossed to different things
and How what your eyes tell you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Lines up with what the story is Right,
right, you know, and sometimes it
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes it adds a lot in terms of what
you see You know like about I have a hard
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a really hard time believing That
the the the sis the 91 the chem D and the
[SPEAKER_03]: one through four all came out of the same
bud Yeah, yeah, you know, they're just too
[SPEAKER_03]: vastly different to me You know,
but that's I wasn't there either You know
[SPEAKER_03]: and a lot of this stuff Is like the most
famous stories They all almost because
[SPEAKER_03]: almost all of them come from accidents and
because a lot of them come from other
[SPEAKER_03]: people It's like the people that marketed
stuff or marketed skittles or marketed
[SPEAKER_03]: cookie or whatever Like they probably you
know different people get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it doesn't get quite as famous You
know, you know and they should get great
[SPEAKER_03]: credit for marketing it to the point that
they did Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah I've never disputed that you
know, I I give lots of people accolades
[SPEAKER_01]: for mark successfully marketing and You
know building, you know clones that would
[SPEAKER_01]: never have been anything up, you know to
what they are What I've always you know
[SPEAKER_01]: frown on of course is you know people
being dishonest doing it I think you can
[SPEAKER_01]: do it honestly and still be successful
Sure, you know having to just make up big
[SPEAKER_01]: old Big old, you know fictitious
backstories or act like you're the one
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible for it That's why instead of
you know, I mean there's cats like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Josh and Matt are like,
oh, yeah It was a harm accident under the
[SPEAKER_01]: stairs and then there's other cats,
you know who are like, yes We created that
[SPEAKER_01]: from our multi-thousand plant grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aren't we awesome?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we popped we popped 15 seeds and the
20th was the best So, you know You know I
[SPEAKER_01]: Think the the truth is is the the biggest
factor for me Yeah, and yeah, there's an
[SPEAKER_03]: aspect where and you know, we should say
this too is that truth is a most people
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone likes to say they want the truth,
but like people that really care about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a really small percentage Yeah
Oh most people like truth if it helps them
[SPEAKER_03]: burnish their money or their reputation or
whatever else Sure, and the truth is
[SPEAKER_01]: usually boring, you know People who are
looking for excitement from the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're gonna be like, oh,
well that was lame Yeah, something up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care Especially when the answer is
99% of the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's a bad seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Or yeah, or you know, or it happened
an accident at my buddy's house This or I
[SPEAKER_03]: was you know, like, you know, you were
early involved and you know the story even
[SPEAKER_03]: just knowing the story is cool Right,
but then people want to be part like they
[SPEAKER_03]: want to be this active component That was
critical to the story, you know right and
[SPEAKER_04]: I did forget someone earlier that was
really important when I was was you know
[SPEAKER_04]: coming in and that was that was doing
reversals before I was and that was rascal
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I think I would be remiss not to
mention him because he was doing good
[SPEAKER_04]: things and had legitimate cuts You know
for the most part as far as I know Like he
[SPEAKER_04]: was doing good fucking work and he was
doing it at a time when it wasn't popular
[SPEAKER_04]: When people were pushing back against
feminine seed, so I give that guy props
[SPEAKER_03]: Too all the stuff that that guy made
between whatever it was Oh nine and twelve
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, all those hybrids are fire Yeah,
it was some good shit in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean he really I'm not maybe not all but
like the vast majority of the stuff He had
[SPEAKER_03]: some really nice cuts and he was crossing
them together and they led to some really
[SPEAKER_04]: nice things Yeah, I mean white fire,
you know a lot of people don't even know
[SPEAKER_04]: like about the white anymore Like not a
lot of people talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the essence behind the white
fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fucking cool, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep That That's one I'd like to touch on
too in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, they they you know does it the
swamp boys big Ricky in particular he he's
[SPEAKER_01]: alluded a lot to Knowing exactly what the
hybrid of the white is because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: supposedly a TK hybrid But you know he he
likes riddles and secrets so Riddles and
[SPEAKER_01]: limericks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it a haiku.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll billy haiku Sometimes I wonder how
long he takes to craft Some of his
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram posts and how to make it like,
you know, he because he's got his own
[SPEAKER_04]: language When it comes to that,
you know, have you seen have you seen
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff like the white inside the TKS ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah there there was a there was one plant
in our first run of them where Actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was there was there was four plants
that we pulled out of the first run and
[SPEAKER_01]: One was a green girl scout cookie like a
green form cut Other was a plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: looked just like the white, you know not
oh but so similar Yeah, it was obvious and
[SPEAKER_01]: then there was the number 50 and the 51
were which were my two actual favorites of
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole bunch and Then you know,
I I smoked both those heavily and the 50
[SPEAKER_01]: turned out to be my absolute favorite of
the whole bunch and so that's the one I
[SPEAKER_01]: kept and Still play with from the first
and then I did another hundred plus,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know TKS one pop and you know got
other selections from there Yeah So Caleb,
[SPEAKER_04]: what do you think about cookies?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that goes into the category of
2000 What 2010 and on for 2010 2011?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah people people ask a bunch of that and
I think I mean, it's a story You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's a story that like there's a lot
of pieces that aren't known that well But
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a definitely one that's gonna create
a let's you know, it's a super popular
[SPEAKER_03]: brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of money involved there's a
lot of rep involved and It's one of those
[SPEAKER_03]: things if you don't get it exactly right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be gunning for you Here's a
relevant one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a relevant one for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you gonna s1 any of the nl selections?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna leave that up to you,
buddy Yeah Yeah, no, I think they'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: worth it I think they do that,
you know, I like my feminized so I'll grow
[SPEAKER_01]: some of Matt's S1 and else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we kept him here for goddamn a long
time.

[SPEAKER_03]: important people for you guys seeing my
face on a weekly basis is the two people
[SPEAKER_03]: on this Talk tonight Guaranteed without
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not be showing my face or chatting
about stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They both pushed for Quite a long time to
get me to tell stories and talk shit Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: so really it it really is they gave me the
confidence to say you people would want to
[SPEAKER_03]: hear it Let's chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk history and you know,
and there's an aspect to it too Where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like a lot of this stuff we're talking
about with you guys This is what we have
[SPEAKER_03]: all been doing amongst each other
privately for fucking ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah So we've all heard each other's
stupid fucking stories a hundred times,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know and and all that and so this is
this is really how information gets
[SPEAKER_03]: information and cuts get saved and shared
and you know history survives and
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally, the point of all this is to get
you know versions of history out there and
[SPEAKER_03]: gets passed along Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, the other people can hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's it's just not a wash in bullshit
