[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_02]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Natso Dodd, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Matthew.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my co-host, Natso.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he's been out for a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's demanded, missed my friend,
Natso.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here we are with our friend Dire Wolf,
who is in shadow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And today we're going to talk about some
of the Canadian scene and some of this IPM
[SPEAKER_03]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we've been meaning to do a show on
IPM and needing to, and it's been heavily
[SPEAKER_03]: requested.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this man has a lot of experience with
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So welcome, Dire Wolf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of happy to be on the on the
black screen with all the critique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natso gets on his hair because I'm having
kind of a bad hair day today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you've seen how they bust his balls
over his hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, you know, facial
expressions, random stuff you don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pick up on and all of a sudden it's a
meme or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the verbal tics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the verbal tics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard being a public speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't really realize it
until you listen to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're like, oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait until you're staring at yourself in a
long selfie for an hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really, it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone that knows anyone that knows me in
real life knows that I'm not like a big,
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of have like a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm known for like my death stare.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I look, I look friendly when I'm
smiling, but I have a death stare a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't translate well over over
phones sometimes too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're super glad to have you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to start out talking a little bit
about your, your early introduction into
[SPEAKER_03]: the import scene in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start there.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it like?
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of stuff were you seeing and
what years are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess now that I think of it,
I actually, my original start was actually
[SPEAKER_01]: a weird start.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually one of my, when I first
started, was exposed to it was actually
[SPEAKER_01]: from a friend, one of the, just a guy from
down the streets, mom, who was,
[SPEAKER_01]: we found out later was like a full on like
closet grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was kind of like this hippie lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we used to, it was her boyfriend
actually got us like started smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'd always just Jack her weed
out of her breadside table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a big story that went with
it about where it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was this exotic import.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turned out afterwards, it was just,
she was literally one of the first growers
[SPEAKER_01]: around our area, growing it all in the
backyard right in front of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but basically that might, so my first
start was with homegrown and then,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there really wasn't much weed going
around back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really all import.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't remember the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started really, I started smoking when I
was like 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's probably like 86 or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, like for, basically in Canada
until like you got a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: domestic stuff, but pretty much from those
mid, like mid eighties until it was like
[SPEAKER_01]: early nineties, there wasn't much domestic
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, cause we didn't get any of like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was not a lot of outdoor and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just the occasional indoor and you
couldn't even really sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, you basically had to, like,
I can totally remember people growing
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor and pressing it into bricks and
selling it because that was the only way
[SPEAKER_01]: you could actually sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you couldn't, people wouldn't buy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they not recognize it as cannabis
because it looks so different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not compressed or what was the reason?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was green was one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and the, no, back then it was just,
people didn't recognize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was possible to grow good wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought it was really, it had to be
imported.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep in mind, this is like back in
like really, you know, so this would be
[SPEAKER_01]: right around the time where Neville was
like launching the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there probably wasn't a whole lot of
like genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, if you even just put in
perspective, if you fast forward four or
[SPEAKER_01]: five years later, I bought my first grow
light and that was the only grow store in
[SPEAKER_01]: our entire province.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the equivalent of your state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We literally had to drive like three hours
to buy a, buy a halide light.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was only, there was literally only
one store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it really wasn't a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I just remind, it was wild when,
when Matt and I interviewed Correll from
[SPEAKER_00]: Super Sativa Seed Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a similar story of when they first
started growing indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tried to brown it out because all
this lime green and green color was like a
[SPEAKER_00]: real issue in the market because everyone
was used to like imported brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had never seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like green was an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people didn't realize it is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just saw it as something completely
unusual.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you read the, I read a book by the,
one of the guys from the cornbread mafia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was pretty much their entire
curing technique was trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: how to make it brown and crappy looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like import.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was literally like everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They threw it on the barn floor and it
was, it was a, for sure a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing, the area where I came
from, it was very, very hash centric.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people didn't even really like buying
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all like, it was all like Afghan,
mostly that Afghani border ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was around, and that was like the
staple and everything else other than
[SPEAKER_01]: black Afghani hash was totally suspect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of it was import from Afghanistan
then as opposed to like a Mexican,
[SPEAKER_03]: like we were getting in the U S it wasn't
really making its way up to Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never actually saw Mexican until dead
tour in like Ohio or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys had a wholly different
language.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I remember like looking at it and
going like this, someone was selling it to
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, this looks like really crappy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, it's mids dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what are mids?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: All we knew was hash and, and high end
hydro in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I know it was, it was all,
it was, you'd get some other stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it definitely wasn't the same type of
import you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty much 90% of it was all like
that Afghan, you know, like the gold
[SPEAKER_01]: stamps, a lot of it, the stuff you see
Afghan, it's like border hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got occasional batches from
Morocco or Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got some weed, but it was
usually pretty high end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was like tie stick occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got a lot of like press Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think I, I think I've maybe
seen Mexican like one time in Canada ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it was around.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you guys used to use the hash?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like actually smoke it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it the, the old knife hits or like a
jar?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the area I'm from is this like tells
you exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things anywhere you go
in the world and everyone would be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, but in our area, like kind of the
equivalent of like, you know, all of New
[SPEAKER_01]: York state, this was like in the kind of,
it was, it was an Ontario thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew up around Toronto area and they
did what was called bottle tokes,
[SPEAKER_01]: which they are horrible when I think back,
but it was like, you get a cigarette and
[SPEAKER_01]: you put a little piece of hash on it and
then you break a hole in the bottom of
[SPEAKER_01]: like a pop bottle and you like brew,
you brew, brew the hash in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was this whole technique and
then you kind of tip it over when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like a lava lamp and then you
suck the hash out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was like a whole, like you were,
it was like, you got social status and a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot in my circles anyways, for like being
a good BT brewer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was like an art form being able to
break the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of, when you look back,
it was like pretty cracky, but that was,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you'll never hear anyone in Canada
know, have a clue what you're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about unless they grew up around Toronto
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everyone knows you're talking
about bottle tokes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to say, you want to say cracky.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look at some of the equipment now for
dabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it just looks like straight meth
pipes to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like it's just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, I'm not, I kind of avoid some of
those, um, even though I kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: dabs, I don't dabble a lot because I just
hate the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my wife can't walk by a dab rig
without accidentally breaking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like an expensive hobby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never got into the whole torch thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that was just too much, too much,
too much to screw up too much to do all
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once they started getting to like emails
and shit, where you could just leave it
[SPEAKER_03]: and set it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It still felt a little cracky,
but puff goes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it was like, okay, this looks like
more like a bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can deal with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like every two or three years in
the hash movement right now, they all kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like just move on from whatever they
did before that they were convinced was
[SPEAKER_00]: the bee's knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just slowly gets dust binned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're not going to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: About that era anymore that we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I'll say about that
is that, you know, I grew up in,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, in Northern, in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even though dire Wolf and I aren't
like too terribly, terribly far from each
[SPEAKER_00]: other, uh, vastly different weed cultures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my weed culture was primarily
Mexican green and Brown, and there was
[SPEAKER_00]: almost no hash culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting how like, you know,
Canada and the different, uh, laws and
[SPEAKER_00]: rules that applied over there led to
vastly different imports that we saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think it's also what, what crime
networks were working there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think the big thing, if you go
from Canada, East to West was totally
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically what was going on in our
area was Montreal, which is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's the port.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the big port that comes into Canada
from the East coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of controlled by,
by like Irish mob mafia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was basically like a free,
you could bring all kinds of stuff through
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything basically for the most part
was coming through that court of Montreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was the interesting thing about
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we found out afterwards, so we kind of
had like someone up until like about 90 or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all this black Afghani hash and it
kind of went dry for like a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a guy that I was good for,
I was actually living with at the time he
[SPEAKER_01]: had this connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like this, this, uh, Irish mafia
dude from Toronto and we were like in
[SPEAKER_01]: university and he had, for whatever
reason, nobody could get, and we found out
[SPEAKER_01]: afterwards what the actual story was,
which is a crazy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody else had hash except for this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were like the Kings because we're
the only guys that could get black hash,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what everyone wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could get like however much you
wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this dude used to show up to our
little like, you know, university student
[SPEAKER_01]: house every Friday night in like a limo
and just bring like slabs of this hash in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was just like one of those guys
that didn't give a crap and he'd like walk
[SPEAKER_01]: out with a Ziploc full of cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like every Friday in and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it turned out, I found out
afterwards, it was the reason why they had
[SPEAKER_01]: access to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was actually Howard Mark's old,
uh, stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Howard Marks would have been in jail at
the time, but apparently he had,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, which if you ever read that Howard
Marks book, he was hooked up with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Irish dude, which kind of all makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But apparently he got, when he went to
jail, he had all these stash houses
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting all over Montreal, still full.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they just sat on him for a while and
then it started coming out through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why that's where our connect
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was all this kind of few year old,
uh, Howard Marks hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might not be true, but I have a
feeling it probably was, which probably
[SPEAKER_01]: tells you a whole lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard similar overlapping stories
about where all that hash came from in
[SPEAKER_01]: Montreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was probably, that's why
everyone was smoking black.
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghani hash was probably because they
were like one or two major importers that
[SPEAKER_01]: were there controlling that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the, the Nortal story,
um, from Neville talking about Nortal and
[SPEAKER_03]: one of his partners.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think one of Mark's partners that
that was, that was one of Mark's partners
[SPEAKER_03]: that had the Nortal thing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was their whole deal, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a guy that was part of the IRA and
he smuggled, they would smuggle hash
[SPEAKER_01]: through the IRA networks, telling them
that it was guns.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of their whole, that was
Howard Marks' partner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super gangster for back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting about all that too,
is that there was a lot of, of hash
[SPEAKER_00]: smugglers that avoided America because the
penalties were so much worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, they, they viewed
America sort of like the place where you
[SPEAKER_00]: went to prison for a long time,
where Europe and Canada and other places
[SPEAKER_00]: were viewed as like a lot chiller if you
actually got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I remember they, they
increased some of the charges here.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I remember during two 15, I remember,
uh, like there were, there were bigger
[SPEAKER_03]: charges for hash or extracts than there
were for, uh, normal cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: At one point I remember it was getting
really bad where like at one point I was
[SPEAKER_03]: pulled over on the way to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like some hash event in LA and it
was like, I stopped, I was like 4 a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pulled over to get gas on my way out of
San Diego and I didn't have a license at
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was suspended.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course I got pulled over like cops
sitting in the gas station waiting for me,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like no one else is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were bored and, uh, they,
they messed with me super hard over the
[SPEAKER_03]: hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like, you know, we can get you
for this though.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, so they, they still took
it seriously here during two 15
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Manufacturing and all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get different grades of how,
how would you, I mean, I know memory can
[SPEAKER_00]: be tough, but like, did you think the
Afghan any hash you were getting back then
[SPEAKER_00]: was high quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it was mixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was, yeah, there was different
grades.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that we didn't necessarily
know they were different grades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but basically, so a lot of it,
there was basically three grades from what
[SPEAKER_01]: I could tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was, and it was just, there was
different batches and probably the loads
[SPEAKER_01]: were mixed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the times back then,
unless you're buying the whole kilo,
[SPEAKER_01]: which when we were like, you know,
15, you weren't getting, um, you weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing what the stamp was on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so basically it all came in,
if you ever see the packs, it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, uh, they all came pretty much all
came in this red cellophane paper,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, wrap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them would have gold seals,
like, which is, you know, probably is gold
[SPEAKER_01]: spray paint with whatever brand of
whatever, just like you see with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Moroccan or you see with the modern hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and we had all, it seems like all
the best stuff would always had no stamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from what I understand, I think that
probably was the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of like the good loads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like the stamp stuff was the
commercial stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some came through that was kind of
like the dealer hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just got each person's hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went through, you know, that guy would
take the good stuff, which was not
[SPEAKER_01]: stamped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know from that a hundred percent,
but there was definitely, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was kind of the third
grade, which kind of, if you talk to some
[SPEAKER_01]: people, they're like, it was all crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was what was called repress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know what the heck they did to
it, but like it was all controlled,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think by the bikers on the street level
and somewhere along the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, bubble man actually saw what they did
once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he was telling me, I still don't
really understand what it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was some type of thing where they
would just, it was cut with something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like a really noticeable,
like the texture was different,
[SPEAKER_01]: but most of the stuff that we were getting
was kind of really high grade or a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: it was kind of just like medium,
but it was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it, it's interesting now the weird
thing with legalization in Canada now is
[SPEAKER_01]: now we actually have a really thriving
import hash seen again on the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's like websites you can go in
Canada that have like the biggest hat
[SPEAKER_01]: import hash selection you've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've tried a bunch of them and,
but it's exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people say, Oh, it used to be so much
better back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally exactly the same as what we
used to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what kind of years did the,
um, Afghani plants in the indoor scene
[SPEAKER_03]: start popping off in your area?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you notice this started to
become a normal, uh, happenstance thing to
[SPEAKER_03]: get to go to someone's house and they had
to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we were pretty like on the,
like my crowd was that was, it was going
[SPEAKER_01]: on before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so I was in, it was probably like
about, it was really early nineties,
[SPEAKER_01]: like probably like 92, 93, maybe 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that we were literally like,
so I went to kind of like the agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: and agricultural university.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was like some of my crowd kind of
were the first people I'm sure other
[SPEAKER_01]: people had grown, but we were really one
of the first people that really started
[SPEAKER_01]: rocking it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it was not common at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, when I went to university,
that was the year that I bought like my
[SPEAKER_01]: first grow light, which was probably like
91 or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, like there wasn't many people
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and it was super like,
we were really some of the only people in
[SPEAKER_01]: town, like everyone, our crew kind of
everyone was like knew who we were or
[SPEAKER_01]: heard of us because we were the guys with
the genetics and that was pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't the whole lot going around
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it was kind of a lot of
scenes like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm sure we weren't the only people
in town, but there wasn't very many.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say the genetics, what kind of
stuff were you first growing for your
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors?
[SPEAKER_03]: Your first indoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, my first indoor was, well,
we, I, sorry, our very first one,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were actually growing import because
everyone had like saved all their seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first real, real grow we did was,
I don't even know what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was literally just like one of my
roommates to all the seeds he saved for
[SPEAKER_01]: like 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We popped and they were all, um,
yeah, pretty equatorial and Hermi and
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we made it all into Brownies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then where, where our kind of big
break came is one of my friends was he had
[SPEAKER_01]: gone on dead tour to the West coast and he
ended up living on some commune.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was in, I can't remember if it
was in Seattle area or Portland area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was down in Portland around
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and he's who can't, he came back
and kind of taught all of our crowd to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of how I learned was from
this dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had just learned from living on
this commune, um, weirdly growing
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry indica is when he, that was
before DJ short was even around and he
[SPEAKER_01]: would always talk blueberry indica back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what we were growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were, so he taught us to grow and he
just had some old stuff from like SSC and
[SPEAKER_01]: a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had, it was mostly skunk wine,
what we were growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also did, I did a lot of skunk
number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also did a lot of haze just because
that happened to be the seeds we had was a
[SPEAKER_01]: silver Pearl or a kind of silver Pearl,
silver, silver haze line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what it was?
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was something different,
but for some reason, but anyways,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes I have this like thing where I
like try to discover, uh, all the names
[SPEAKER_00]: that since he changed, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes Matt, you know, it's like a
hobby or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the interesting parts is
when, when Sensei bought Neville seed
[SPEAKER_00]: bank, they wanted to obscure how much of
it was just a direct port over from the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed bank itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they ended up changing a bunch of
names, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but the big clue, um, with silver haze
was that they, in Sensei, they claimed in
[SPEAKER_00]: the silver haze advertisement in the,
in the book that it won the 89,
[SPEAKER_00]: it won the overall 89 cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go look at what won the 89 cannabis
cup and it's silver Pearl by haze from
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to put it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you got to get the advertisement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, that was actually like a really
helpful piece of information because we
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have like, uh, we have photos of
the old, of the old magazine spread and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's right there, you know, so it started
out as like early Pearl by skunk one by NL
[SPEAKER_00]: five by haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it got changed to silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was, and then I thought
somebody had said it was an Ortega or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was thinking maybe that, but I
originally had thought what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're right too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this weird thing where Neville
used to call, uh, a maple leaf by,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, he crossed Afghan tea to haze as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he called that silver haze,
but I don't think he actually ever sold
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he kept it private.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of the ones that Shanti
uses a lot now, if I'm correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: From seat, from seat at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he crossed when he, the first two
things that he crossed haze, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was Afghan tea and NL five and NL five
obviously got released and became the
[SPEAKER_00]: super popular thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, but anyway, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, uh, the 89 cannabis cup winner,
silver Pearl by haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a weird one to start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we start when we had no idea it was
just the only genetics we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were running all this haze and it
wasn't super long flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they were, they were, I think we,
I crossed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of the first kind of messing
with genetics that I really did is I
[SPEAKER_01]: crossed just because that's what we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I crossed some of that silver haze with
like a skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we kind of had like the seed line that
we kept popping for a long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: just because it was the only genetics we
had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it was weird because it was
actually really similar to like that sweet
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk that, that I grow now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's partly why I grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It totally like reminds me of like 1993 or
whatever, when we were growing these
[SPEAKER_01]: silver haze cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see that being really good though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a skunk one silver Pearl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, like that would be pretty legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think like it would be fast
flowering, probably have good bud
[SPEAKER_03]: structure, good resin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relatively fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like 70 days and then we were
probably picking it too early back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was probably 70 or 75 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, I always think it was,
it yielded, but it wasn't, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it wouldn't have been like a great
cashcropper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other weird one that you
never said I've never most, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: most of the stuff you see back then I'm
like, it's still pretty similar to what
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like there's a lot of stuff now
that's pretty similar to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that I've never seen that was like
it is we used to have this Durban,
[SPEAKER_01]: which for sure it was one of my buddies
brought it back from Sensi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it was till I've never seen
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really like, it could quite well
have had Indica in it, but it didn't look
[SPEAKER_01]: because it kind of, it was like finished
really quick and it kind of had a short
[SPEAKER_01]: stature, but it was like this really
weird, like full on sativa, but with
[SPEAKER_01]: really dark leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it totally had that, this crazy
like anise taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you hear people say with Durban,
it wasn't super potent, but it was
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely like pretty unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was one of the better tasting weeds
that I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've tried a bunch Durban since and
I've never seen anything remotely like
[SPEAKER_01]: that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really see the, the anise Durban
at all ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like you hear these tales of this,
this beautiful Sensi Durban and you just,
[SPEAKER_03]: for some reason the, the turpentine one
seems to be the one everybody kept.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that just seems to be what I run
into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a hundred percent just like
anise.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would, that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's certainly a shame because
we're talking about things realistically
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking that aren't that, that long ago,
but the nature of prohibition kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: means that like was, you know,
you could have something that was common
[SPEAKER_00]: and five or 10 years go by and all of a
sudden it's just disappeared.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so talk about some of your early
crosses, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you talked about the skunk one by
Silver Haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there any other ones that you were
doing early on that you found success in
[SPEAKER_03]: or weird stuff in?
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one that we can go into a bit,
but honestly, like you were so,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been like, I'm pretty big on
like not messing around unless you can pop
[SPEAKER_01]: some decent amounts of like numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can never really pop that many that
much for numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only one, so I did kind of so I
played around early and then for a big
[SPEAKER_01]: part of when I was growing, I just kind of
got out of it because I was so worried
[SPEAKER_01]: about plant count all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing I had to be doing was like
popping males and, and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one, so the one I think I told you
guys about where I was joking that maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: it was the, the purple oracle precursor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the only one that I ever did that
was kind of got pretty famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was at the time there was no,
there was really no purple weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had gone to Amsterdam and brought
back, we went to Positronix and I brought
[SPEAKER_01]: back a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them was a strain called purple
star, which was like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they don't, I don't think it's even,
I don't know if that's even a thing in
[SPEAKER_01]: Holland, but they used to be, they have
all these different purple strains that
[SPEAKER_01]: were for outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It were Dutch passion had and Pauzy had
and probably a couple of others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyways, I brought that back and it
was like actually pretty good yielder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't, it wasn't really very good
quality, but it looked decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like a total novelty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like super purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had crossed that to, we had like a
skunk number one crossed with Hindu Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: and I crossed it to this purple star.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually got some pretty nice ones
that were kind of like way, way nicer than
[SPEAKER_01]: the purple star.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they were kind of indoor quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and we had that and I gave my old
partner at the time he had moved out West
[SPEAKER_01]: to kind of like our little humble,
which is like the Kootenays, which is like
[SPEAKER_01]: Nelson.
[SPEAKER_01]: BC and he had moved out there and he,
before he left, he grabbed a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: crapload of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if it was the Hindu skunk
purple star, or if it was that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was actually that it was mixed
with that crossed with a, an Aurora
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica, which was a Northern light strain
that Pauzy had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, he popped like quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he popped like a hundred or two of
those and got this one that they called,
[SPEAKER_01]: they just called it papaya.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like this really nice,
purple, it was kind of like checkerboard
[SPEAKER_01]: purple pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these guys were like big, they were
like ballers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so they were doing, they were in
like the export crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that clone just totally blew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a while, so in BC, there's kind of
like, everyone always talked whenever most
[SPEAKER_01]: people that you hear talk, they're always
talking about like coastal BC,
[SPEAKER_01]: like Vancouver area.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go inland with 10 hours,
there's, this is where the Kootenays are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where our real like,
that's where the real players go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a while, for like a couple of
years, there was a, that was like one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the most popular clones being grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this papaya thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I was joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause when, when not so was saying they
used to call Oracle the Barney and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what the buyers used to call this stuff
was the Barney.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was probably years.
[SPEAKER_00]: What years was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have been like, I would think
it was probably like late, like late
[SPEAKER_01]: nineties, like somewhere between like 98
and 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the interesting part about the,
you know, a lot of the purple cuts that
[SPEAKER_00]: became famous in Northern California and
kind of in our scene is that there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of like people that claim things to,
you know, about them, but there's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: little like verifiable fact.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is unusual for a strain strains that
got that famous to stay that obscure for
[SPEAKER_00]: that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of competing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, there's actually a guy in
Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't mention his name, but there was a,
there was kind of a kooky guy in Mendo who
[SPEAKER_00]: claims that he went up to BC and ended up
smuggling clones back taped to his thigh
[SPEAKER_00]: in cigar, in cigar cases, like in cigar,
you know, like like the tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he taped him to his thigh.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pre when pre before Osama ruined
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when, you know, when airport
security got a lot rougher after 2001,
[SPEAKER_00]: but pre to that it was a lot looser and
he, he swears to God that he brought these
[SPEAKER_00]: clones from, from BC down to Mendo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to be super clear, I'm not making any
claims to purple oracle and just joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I believe me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that there are people that will tell
you with absolute certainty that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start poking around in it and
it'd be, and there's holes and this and
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's one of the few things that,
that with purple oracle, with grape ape,
[SPEAKER_00]: with lavender and things like that,
there really isn't a settled story that
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone believes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some competing stories and there's
ones that like, we're pretty sure aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, for, for as famous as it was
and as big of an issue as it was in
[SPEAKER_00]: California, for a while, most of those,
most of, not all, but most of those purple
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts, the origins are still kind of a
mystery.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it's cool that you mentioned
purple star.
[SPEAKER_03]: Purple star is actually one of the
baselines of purples for, for purple
[SPEAKER_03]: number one, for shaman, for a lot of the
Dutch purples all came from that purple
star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it related to Viking?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I think they all probably came
from Viking because I think Viking kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: predates those and they were all pretty,
I think, they were definitely related
[SPEAKER_01]: because we got that cream Sotica you hear
about was totally out of that same family.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just, you look at it and you're like,
that's one of those old crappy purple
[SPEAKER_01]: Dutch outdoor screams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Positronics about a year and a half ago,
they, they went into their, their library
[SPEAKER_03]: of mom seeds, their, their parents seeds
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were kind enough to take me out
the parentage of purple star, whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: they used to make it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they sent me the seeds, but they
disappeared on the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so bummed because I was like,
I finally get to look at the parents of
[SPEAKER_03]: purple star.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like most people wouldn't be that stoked
about it cause it's kind of goofy and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, it's interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be really funny, honestly,
if, if there's an element of that story is
[SPEAKER_00]: true because you know, coming,
being in California when this is fast
[SPEAKER_00]: boarding a bit so we can go back after,
but one of the things that really made the
[SPEAKER_00]: purple craze in like oh, oh three,
oh four, oh five, really take off was that
[SPEAKER_00]: California was getting flooded by,
you know, beat by Canadian indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once brokers learned that the Canadian
indoor was so much cheaper than California
[SPEAKER_00]: homegrown, they started buying it and
trying to pass it off as California
[SPEAKER_00]: homegrown and making massive margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it was pretty midsy,
you know, it was just, it wasn't flushed
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was grown with too high EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was their best down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was also, it was sealed in a,
in a vacuum sealer, you know, so it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of fermented a little bit like in,
in transport, not that there wasn't some
[SPEAKER_00]: good stuff coming down, but a lot of it
was bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things in California,
especially in the Bay that started the
[SPEAKER_00]: purple craze was that the purple wasn't
Canadian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was homegrown, you know,
and you knew it was from California
[SPEAKER_00]: because people were getting bunked by
buying weed for 4,400 that was Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: that these guys were buying for two grand
and making the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it was like, that was one of
the things that started the purple craze
[SPEAKER_00]: in NorCal was there wasn't any BC coming
down that was purple at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was like a, it was marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was early marketing, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and two 15 had opened up in
California enough that once it got into
[SPEAKER_00]: the clubs and once, you know, popularity
spiked, then it just was rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a, it was a marketable thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think the, the Beasters guys got a
little bit of a bad rap just for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that all the good stuff that
went down, just got called and asked
[SPEAKER_01]: humble to nobody questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the crap stuff just got all these
Beasters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I think they did sell,
they definitely did.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of Beasters got shipped
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we actually probably kept the
worst Beasters up here, because if you go
[SPEAKER_01]: the kind of backstory of like the
commercial market here was always this cut
[SPEAKER_01]: called M39, which is like, I can't imagine
anybody ever exported that, but maybe they
[SPEAKER_01]: did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, this, it was probably
just M39 from SSC, which I think was a
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just these rock hard orange,
like, like they probably literally cut
[SPEAKER_01]: them at 39 days or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it was still to this day,
the worst weed I've ever smoked ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's so funny about that,
man, is that these days people,
[SPEAKER_00]: most people who smoke weren't around back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are a bunch of people that
are, you know, there are some people out
[SPEAKER_00]: there that are, they're touting that they
have M39.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rezdon's one who's bringing back the M39.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's an aspect of it
because most people, all they remember is
[SPEAKER_00]: the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all they remember is the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I wanted to ask you before I
forgot is that when you were on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, before I, before you and I had
even chatted, you had posted this picture
[SPEAKER_00]: on your IG of this old Northern Lights
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first one I ever posted on
IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was wondering, and that to me,
I would just want, you know, if you could
[SPEAKER_00]: expound on that cutting a little bit,
because I remember it where you were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, you know, this is from the late
eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It descends from the seed bank era.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost it, but it was a staple for,
you know, 20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the closest thing in my crew that
was, I would consider like a long,
[SPEAKER_01]: like our crew is, I guess it was pretty
rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people didn't really keep cuts around
and they were all chasing most of my,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was never like super big into the
commercial scene, but a lot of my friends
[SPEAKER_01]: were like big, like they were heavily into
the commercial scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were chasing, just no different
than today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's chasing whatever the newest
gelato crosses or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were chasing whatever was hypey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they never kept anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this, and that specific NL clone was
around our crew for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it originally came from that same guy
I was talking about before that the papaya
[SPEAKER_01]: clone came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was kind of like my original partner
when we were younger, like we got started
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still good friends today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was always like in the thick of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, he was kind of one of my kind
of main connections because he hung out
[SPEAKER_01]: with some people I had zero interest in
hanging out with, but they always like
[SPEAKER_01]: good genetics and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had brought it back out from
Nelson.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had gotten it there from one of
my friend's dads who lives just outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: Vancouver and was called Squamish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that one we could definitely
trace back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was literally like, I know the
guy it came from and it was like his dad
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was from whatever, like I don't
remember, 87 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was right around like that time period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one was totally, it looked just
like a lot of the NLs that we've grown,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it totally had a completely different
turf profile and was way, way frostier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was the first plant I'd ever
seen that had like, if you grew it right,
[SPEAKER_01]: that picture doesn't probably do it
justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grew it right, it was one of those
ones that had kind of like, remember on
[SPEAKER_01]: the white widows where the resin went like
right to the end of like the sugar leaf or
[SPEAKER_01]: even part on the fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just crazy turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I remember the one guy, one of my
friends that used to move a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like it would just, he used to keep it
in his freezer and you'd crack the freezer
[SPEAKER_01]: and just like his whole house would smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a really unique turf profile
that I honestly can't even put a finger
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of wonder whether it's maybe when
Neville talks about those juniper flavors,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was maybe that, but it was like,
it was a weird like kind of out of spacey
[SPEAKER_01]: type of flavor that I've never really had
since.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that one was definitely like around
our crowd for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I remember like not keeping it and
then being, man, I really want that or
[SPEAKER_01]: someone to be asking for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd go find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could always like a friend of a
friend's brother had that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just called it the NL clone and it made
ridiculous hash and it made ridiculous
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was kind of pretty leafy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got a lot of trim, but I remember
just pulling like, I can't remember what
[SPEAKER_01]: the ratio was, but just giant honks of
hash off of that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always interested in that kind of
stuff because we have so few pictures that
[SPEAKER_00]: survive of a lot of those original
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and especially like, you know,
ones that people found in those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and some lines we have a few pictures
and other lines, you know, it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I haven't saved just because you
know what it reminds me of, and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: exact cause I know it's a hybrid,
but the way that it's super frosty and the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that the top crowns, it kind of
reminded me of Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find all the NLs remind me of Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so were the other ones that we had,
I guess right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that just reminds me and not exactly
cause Bubba is a hybrid or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like it just reminds me of like that,
especially when Neville would talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: like a single Cola kind of small,
you know, like almost yellowish at times,
[SPEAKER_00]: very resinous, uh, short, Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it really, it really matches up well
with his description of what his NL was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might even grown slower than Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a really super, it was the
squaddest plant I've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think cause it was so old and it
really lost a lot of bigger, but it was
[SPEAKER_01]: brutal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember at the time we had like
this really strong plant count.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was kind of late when I was
growing it and I used to grow it as trees
[SPEAKER_01]: into like a vertical Scrog set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were six feet, so six feet tall
trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into like a Scrog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just took for freaking ever to
get it up to size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually used to, I used to actually
spray it with a really low doses of
[SPEAKER_01]: gibberellic acid just to make the inner
inputs stretch like during the,
[SPEAKER_01]: during the veg time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an old trick for, for squatty ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what kind of turf profile did you say
it had?
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I could, I, it doesn't compare
to anything I've tried to now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I would say it was no, it was
stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was similar to a lot of the modern
stuff, but I mean, it's not in flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in like strength of turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it probably had, you know, probably at
least 3% turps, which was on, but if you
[SPEAKER_01]: compare it to what was going around back
then, like that was, it was totally
[SPEAKER_01]: another level than most stuff going around
back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a weird, it almost had a little bit
of a, it was really hashy, but it really
[SPEAKER_01]: had kind of like, there was some fruit,
like almost like a grapey tone to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just, it was the one that I,
it's kind of like, I would, it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: really hard to describe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of like, Oh gee, there was a
lot of stuff, weird stuff going in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's honestly, when I looked back,
that's one of the few that I've like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that would, that one would still be
cool to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be novel now that it's
something that nobody else, nobody else
[SPEAKER_01]: has.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it was necessarily better
than anything that's around now,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it would hold its, it would still
hold, hold its weight compared to like
[SPEAKER_01]: modern stuff, which I would say most of
the stuff from that era definitely
wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what, what year did it end up kind
of fading out and go missing?
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been the exact one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at when Stephen Harper became
prime minister of Canada, I was the last
[SPEAKER_01]: guy holding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got rid of it when he came in,
because he put all these crazy mandatory
[SPEAKER_01]: minimums and I couldn't hold my cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking it was probably like 2003 or
something like that.
2004.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they had it literally down to,
I think you're going to go to jail for
[SPEAKER_01]: five years for five plants or something,
mandatory minimums.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, that was the time when I was like,
okay, like breeding and keeping lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: mothers kind of went out the window under,
under that dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we're, since we're on that,
that sort of era subject, I have another
[SPEAKER_00]: IG post you made that I wanted to chat
about, which was, I went out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cups in the late nineties,
a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I brought back,
which I wish I still had seeds of,
[SPEAKER_00]: was the first year that they released
Neville's Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's actually one of the first
things you and I chatted about was you
[SPEAKER_00]: posted these pictures of some old
Neville's Hayes grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you got that, you got that
Neville's Hayes right around that same
[SPEAKER_00]: era, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The late nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, I think it was 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't right when they, it was the
first round of seeds that I got,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it had been around for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember exactly when it was because
it was, I'm pretty sure it was right
[SPEAKER_01]: around, it was like 99 or 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it got released in 98.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically like the very first
era of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was when I first decided I kind of got
out of like the, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just branched out and was like,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to try growing some
different stuff and I don't really care
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, if it looks nice and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just started playing around with a
lot of different plants and that was one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started doing some Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was one of the ones I think
actually how we started talking was
[SPEAKER_01]: actually Ortega because I grew out a lot
of Maple Leaf Indica as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that Neville's Hayes was,
that was a learning lesson, but that was
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty, I grew out, I think I had three
packs of that and I grew them all out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually got some, mostly it was pretty
jungly weed, but I mean, it was crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: strong, like just like the extra extracts
on that stuff were just scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's the picture right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I actually, one of the cooler plants
I've ever grown came out of that pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one that looked full on like
Sativa, like really Hayes structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the buds were little, were dead on
like NL five miniature little pine cone
[SPEAKER_01]: buds, but they were literally like half a
centimeter long kind of like little Sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: buds, but they were rock hard little
Indica things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were literally like look like
little candies or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was still one of the most bizarre
hybrid expressions I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tasted like had that kind of insensi
taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely leaned more towards NL five,
but it was a cool, cool plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things, one of the things I
liked about your description of it was I
[SPEAKER_00]: think you nicknamed one of those cuts
party slayer because the high made so many
[SPEAKER_00]: people uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would like kill the vibe when you
brought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had at the time there was one of my
friends was had the, he lived just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: an hour or so north of Toronto and in this
kind of pretty small town.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like not as tiny as like probably
30,000 and he used to sell most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: weed to like the 20 something year olds
crowd there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a batch of, we just ended up
having to, we were just growing it for
[SPEAKER_01]: like hobby stuff and we ended up having
too much every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so some of those Neville's Hayes would
end up going into like the commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: market with no, there was no names back
then, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd just sell this crappy looking weed
and my buddy would, would sell it in and
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone, I think, I think we were having,
which is, I don't remember the story,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was, it looked like crap and
everyone was like thinking it was swag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, they would all puff that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was no, we had a bad batch that
didn't burn well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were all like really huffing on
it, trying to get the thing to burn
[SPEAKER_01]: properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they, and no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's got like a 20 minute
creep on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would all be trying to puff them
furiously on this doobie to try and get it
[SPEAKER_01]: to burn properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the nutrients has gotten mixed
up because the, you know, we weren't used
[SPEAKER_01]: to growing like 16 weeks of Tivas and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then everyone would get like
super, super high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then the whole party would end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, it became like legend for
like a year or so there was all this
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville's Hayes getting dumped into the,
so it was like, they were literally,
[SPEAKER_01]: that dude used to sell like M39,
which you could basically not get high off
[SPEAKER_01]: of a little bit of that NL.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this, the no burn, the no burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were telling me a story too,
I think about like your friends that
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't in construction and they got too
high to even come off the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I used to have this one friend who's
was one of the heaviest smokers you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: ever meet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he always used to like, you know,
you got like super killer weed and most
[SPEAKER_01]: people back would be like, Holy cow,
like that was so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could never phase Dawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Dawn was just, I, you could give him
like the, you know, that bubble,
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble hash from that crazy Northern
lights clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him once thinking this was going to
blow him away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just like did this massive like
dab of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just like, eh, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like nothing would phase this dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, him and one of his buddies had a
roofing company and they hadn't seen him
[SPEAKER_01]: for like a year or so I'd moved away from
town and, uh, I needed a new roof on my
[SPEAKER_01]: house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I had this one, like a really
steep roof that was a little treacherous
[SPEAKER_01]: to be walking around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before they went on to redo the roof,
he's like to go, I don't have any weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had this, uh, Neville's haze was
Neville's haze mixed with Neville's haze
[SPEAKER_01]: hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like really strong this joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably did it purposely really strong
just to try and phase Dawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, they smoked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't even that big of a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: They smoked this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just thought nothing like,
cause nothing ever fazed this dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was like, where are those
dudes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they've been up there for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I yelled up and they like stuck their
head over the roof and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, we just got to sit it out up here
for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were up there for hours just tripping
on this Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I literally, I have this clear
memory of smoking what I would classify as
[SPEAKER_00]: a pinner of Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when I first tried it with two other
people, so I probably only got three or
[SPEAKER_00]: four good hits off it before it was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have this clear memory in Amsterdam
of like walking out of dude's house and
[SPEAKER_00]: like gripping the railing for the six
steps down to the road, like gripping it
[SPEAKER_00]: with my life because I didn't want to
fall, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like it messed with my equilibrium and
like I was soaring high and it hit me in
[SPEAKER_00]: such an unusual way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could absolutely see like being like,
I am not fucking with that ladder at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there is no ladder in my future for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just here where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to sit where I'm at and I'm
going to wait until the ladder makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I have this memory of like,
like being like, I can't go down these
[SPEAKER_00]: steps without this railing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without assistance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I needed, and I was like,
you know, I don't know, 23 or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was totally nice weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were dry steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I wanted to make sure that
I had a center when I walked down them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was definitely like the abstractive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So haze is like, I always find haze like
you can smoke, if you smoke regularly,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you smoke, I find most people that
you just get hit every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can smoke haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like just, because I don't think
it's super strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, but it's when you just smoke a
little bit too much, which is a lot easier
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're smoking like a hash joint or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just, you know, creeps up on you
and all of a sudden you're taking the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the night bus downtown.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have all the time, I have people
that smoke all the time that I'll give
[SPEAKER_01]: like that sweet skunk to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't look that great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're used to smoking cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of them have just never even
smoked like proper haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you always hear kind of similar stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I swear somebody just smokes every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, what the heck was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they just got caught sideways by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe science will eventually tell you,
but if you, you can be like very used to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking a lot of like what we would
consider high end strains these days,
[SPEAKER_00]: like chems and Bubbas and, you know,
and, and OGs and different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an aspect to hazes where they
just kind of hit you a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes like you're a newbie and you
don't have a tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing that I, I generally,
I maybe smoke a bit more now, but I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember back then I definitely couldn't
smoke hazes every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I remember thinking, I was like this,
you know, weed snob and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I only like hazes is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you looked at my jars, the
Neville's haze sat there for a long period
[SPEAKER_01]: of time and the lights like went down real
quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was always more, it was more like a
mild psychedelic for me, like smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville's hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could get in the way of your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you could, you know,
most weed I can smoke and it enhances my
[SPEAKER_00]: day, but you know, there's some weed and
haze is one of them that can alter your
[SPEAKER_00]: day and send you on a completely different
path than you were on before.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy when you get not so,
or Tom Hill talking haze, you could get
[SPEAKER_03]: them doing this for hours at a time,
waxing poetic endlessly about haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'll say this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, at that point I'd been going to
Amsterdam for four or five years at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point, generally at least once or twice a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the stuff that I got was not
that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through a lot of stuff and I tossed
a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the hybrids I made with some of
the American stuff I had ended up much
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of had this opinion that,
you know, what we had was clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: superior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, those hazes,
some of those haze hybrids that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: over there, that was the first thing where
all of a sudden I was like, maybe these
[SPEAKER_00]: old timers tales of like soaring
psychedelic Colombian that you get tracers
[SPEAKER_00]: in your vision and you're giggly and you
have a hard time walking, which I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thought was bullshit up till that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden I was like, oh,
it's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be rare, you know, but it's real.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've literally chased that high ever since
I've had it, you know, the first time
[SPEAKER_03]: experiencing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's common with a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, psychedelic experience and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for some people too, it makes them
want to crawl out of their skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a disassociative,
very uncomfortable, like not used to it
[SPEAKER_00]: type of high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting in that regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: My experience started out with the roller
coaster paranoia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the end of the high is when the
visual elements were started turning into
[SPEAKER_03]: a clear headed where you could see
tracers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is just a whole other experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just why that's that's why it
sticks with me, because like like like
[SPEAKER_00]: Direwolf was saying, like he's got an
unflappable buddy that like would almost
[SPEAKER_00]: never give praise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the guy smokes a joint and
doesn't want to use a ladder for hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could honestly say he's never given
praise ever except for the Neville's Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only time I've ever seen that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I always like that story,
you know, because he was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, no, no, no, no ladder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to sit right here while I'm
safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing that didn't make it over into
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot that I think I personally am always
interested about whenever I have anyone
[SPEAKER_03]: any of my Canadian friends I like talking
about a little bit are the hash plants
[SPEAKER_03]: that made their way through Canada,
like the Rene, the champagne.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were some other biker ones,
if I remember correctly, that were
[SPEAKER_03]: popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have much experience with those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a ton.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, I actually just by
coincidence just picked up the Rene cut
[SPEAKER_01]: off a friend of mine last week,
but I've never actually tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard pretty mixed reviews on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's got to be one of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just talking to my friend about that
when I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, it's been around since at
least like 93 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people like not a lot of stuff that
gets held around that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's definitely a lot of people
like my friends, like I didn't think it
[SPEAKER_01]: was that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard Kamara say he didn't think it was
that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other ones were kind of so that was
basically from what I can tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was like a group of bikers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were kind of their elite biker
cuts, like for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the story is, and again, all this gets
highlighted, this is Reefer Man enters the
[SPEAKER_01]: picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stuff gets a little, it's hard to
separate facts from fiction because he's
[SPEAKER_01]: very adept at mixing the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I always disliked about people
like Reefer Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually has a ton of great
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just mixes it with a ton of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you never know what's real.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, the story that he has,
which seems to kind of play out is there's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like a group of bikers out on
Vancouver Island that were doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: runs back then from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the story is that it was import.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was seed from import, which I find hard
to envision, but I guess maybe I've heard
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of different stories, but
definitely I think they all for sure came
[SPEAKER_01]: out of like kind of either Vancouver
Island or north of Vancouver or somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: on coastal BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think almost all of those came from
the same group.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was like Champagne, that's when the
ancestors of like Pink Kush, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: like King, Queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one called Jiffy Pot,
maybe even that God Bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they all came out of the same
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, like Champagne, I only saw it
in, I've never grown it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had it in flower form a couple of
times and it was really early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I remember like it was like 93 or
something like that when I went through
[SPEAKER_01]: and there was nothing else like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was super high end for the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's anything like super
special.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like a really nice hash plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of the Canadian ones are kind of
based around those, that kind of group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you look at like the Special K,
Pink Kush, Kings Cross, it used to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of got a little bit obscured
because what Reeferman did is he took that
[SPEAKER_01]: King cut, which was one of the legit OG,
like original ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he crossed it with a whole bunch of
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he crossed it with like a lot of like
modern US stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't hold me to this, but I think it was
like MK All-Star, which is like an OG G13
[SPEAKER_01]: cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: He crossed it with, I think San Fernando
Valley OG seed line and a few other
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at it now, it's like,
I don't know, is it real?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what goes around is, so Pink Kush,
everyone is like, oh, that's the old King
[SPEAKER_01]: cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think it's actually
necessarily the old King cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's crosses with the old King
cut to modern Kush varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I had to lay bets, it's probably
liens heavily or towards like modern Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties than the King.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never begun the original one,
but they were definitely- I had some of
[SPEAKER_03]: those seeds, the King seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think when I was going to do a
collab with Y-East and Compound before I
[SPEAKER_03]: knew much about Compound, he ended up with
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So somewhere there are King seeds still in
existence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know if they're a cross though.
[SPEAKER_01]: The White Buffalo guys still definitely
hold it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've tried to fill out hybrids out of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They definitely have a lot of those old
cuts still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they definitely have the King.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know they've said, they've told me
or said to my buddy that they're like the
[SPEAKER_01]: Pink Kush that goes around now doesn't
look anything like the King that they
[SPEAKER_01]: hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he needs to be partners with
Reeferman.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure he has the original King.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did a lot of that early work for
Reeferman, butterscotch Hawaiian,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I ended up liking a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Reeferman, I always talked it down,
but I loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ever get to try that one over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally, I did not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally avoided anything to do with
Reeferman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure he had good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just one of those people that just,
I just, his aura just passes through
[SPEAKER_01]: anything he touches for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just don't want anything to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can appreciate that for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, there's a lot of lines
like that that I didn't touch because of
[SPEAKER_03]: just the juju associated with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you never know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people have bad juju that just flows
through everything they touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, it's an issue in
cannabis because a lot of the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: end up doing a lot of work, you start
digging into them and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, like we really attract,
our community attracts a lot of quirky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that quirky is just quirky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that quirky is like,
you're like, Oh man, that's not that cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on your perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it, you know, one of the things Dire
Wolf that like, I don't know if you talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about this on the thing you just did,
but Matt and I, we sort of had this gig
[SPEAKER_00]: where we were doing like sort of like the
histories of the seed banks and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were going to do some stuff on
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended up just not doing it because
we both realized that neither one of us
[SPEAKER_00]: had enough of a base of actual information
and history to like do it any justice,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the characters involved,
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Canada is definitely sort of what
I consider to be like the third wave of
[SPEAKER_00]: seed banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not just in terms of like seed
brokers, but you know, just whole groups
[SPEAKER_00]: of people all of a sudden coming up with,
you know, seed banks themselves and blends
[SPEAKER_00]: of their own stuff and blends of European
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of that around for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost dominated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did dominate for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did dominate for a while for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Federation, you know,
Reefer Man, was it Joe, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the islands.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of people up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing I would say about that,
that I think gets a little bit skewed and
[SPEAKER_01]: not necessarily in a bad way, but although
I would say all pretty much entirely the
[SPEAKER_01]: history of kind of what was coming out of
cannabis comes from a handful of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes from Chimera, Breeder Steve,
Red from Legends, and Reefer Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe I'm mixing a couple,
but I mean, keep in mind those guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: minus the Reefer Man, like Red,
Chimera, Breeder Steve, they were all from
[SPEAKER_01]: like the same crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they're talking about,
when they talk about all this stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, that wasn't what they,
you know, you listen to them and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, everyone was growing, you know,
sweet tooth and whatever they were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legends Ultimate Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like in my crowd and I said,
some of my friends were pretty big
[SPEAKER_01]: rollers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't the only people that I was
the only one that knew anything about
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned about it from the internet,
not from what was going on in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that gets a little bit skewed
where I think they definitely were like a
[SPEAKER_01]: representative of what was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was definitely, it was definitely
far more diverse than it sounds coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not saying they're being
self-serving at anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think they're just telling their
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a small segment of what was
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other big thing there,
like I said, is that divide where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: all talking about what kind of was going
on in lower mainland BC, which is like the
[SPEAKER_01]: Vancouver area or also Vancouver Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where that other kind of camp,
which there was definitely a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: growing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the most of the population
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that Kootenay Nelson area is always
been like the real bread and butter of
[SPEAKER_01]: like the wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was going on there still to this
day, whatever's going, like you go like on
[SPEAKER_01]: the coast, it's all like everyone's
growing Pink Cush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pink Cush has been dominating that scene
for like a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go to the Kootenays,
nobody grows Pink Cush.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all growing whatever, something
totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's a total, and that Breeder Steve
Camara crowd was really like a coast of
[SPEAKER_01]: Vancouver kind of based group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so there was other groups that
were totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were based out of the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go back to those, you're
talking about all those, most of those,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think pretty much all of those Canadian
seed companies, they were all from Mark
[SPEAKER_01]: Emory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they were all getting offered
through him.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there was definitely,
like, I think that federation,
[SPEAKER_01]: next generation, federation turned into
next generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that next generation guy is still
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never met him, but I think that guy
gets underrepresented.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, he's still like, he was one of
the most of those Romulan genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would argue all of the Romulan genetics
going around in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: probably came from next generation and
Federation seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of those ones that went through
Emory were kind of just like, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how those guys got started.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, it was just knockoffs of
knockoffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I think they basically started as
they were working with Breeder Steve and
[SPEAKER_01]: ended up with a bunch of Breeder Steve
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they started, I don't know what story
was, but that's definitely federation had
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot of like grapefruit and sweet
skunk and the stuff that Steve was working
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think they did some real work and
they brought some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they were doing UBC chemo,
which is kind of a unique one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some other ones like Berlin
and some like kind of more BC centric
[SPEAKER_01]: ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think who the other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jordan of the Islet is still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never heard of BC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember a company called BC Grown?
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not think I remember that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was early to mid 2000s.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a dude named Jordan who ran it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've always tried to figure out if
that was Jordan from the same person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because it was a lot of the same
stuff, a lot of the god bud stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I just, you know, I come from an
era where like, you know, basically like
[SPEAKER_00]: all those waves, you know, I can't tell
you how many times I read Neville's
[SPEAKER_00]: catalogs or senses catalogs or the Dutch
catalogs or all this stuff in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: culture, you know, all the various stuff
that Mark Emory would sell from the
[SPEAKER_00]: various seed companies and their
descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there wasn't obviously like there
wasn't there wasn't internet, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so much and there wasn't like a vibrant
clone trading community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was all very tight in your circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you wanted stuff outside your
circle, you would peruse the seed lists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see what sounded cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one thing I will say that in my
opinion came out of that scene,
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't prove it, but I would lay bets
that it did was the auto I honestly think
[SPEAKER_01]: the auto flowers all came out of Canadian
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at the sequence of events,
this is one that maybe a little bit biased
[SPEAKER_01]: to because I was kind of close to a lot of
parts of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was originally there was that
much you guys probably heard that Mighty
[SPEAKER_01]: Might strain was kind of back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mighty Might was it came from one of
the Gulf Islands or just one of the little
[SPEAKER_01]: islands between between just off the coast
of BC was kind of that area had a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: like draft Dodgers and like kind of
dropout people would kind of go live on
[SPEAKER_01]: those islands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is actually a guy that I know his
dad's group that was growing that and who
[SPEAKER_01]: knows if what it actually was supposedly
like a Himalayan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like this really it's like a
really big really indica really strong
[SPEAKER_01]: central cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the phenos would go off
automatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you trace back in Canada,
anyways, if you trace back pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: every time somebody is like talking about
some super early strain, most of them come
[SPEAKER_01]: back to Mighty Might.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just it's one of those ones you
can just look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, that's got Mighty Might in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a friend of mine sent me a picture a
couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like some acclimated tie strain he
had been passed down to the generations
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took one look.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, that's Mighty Might.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my my old partner used to do a lot of
so kind of I think where that got
[SPEAKER_01]: popularized is in Mark Emory was selling
some seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time, my old partner was doing
these crazy grows of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had up in northern Ontario,
they were like living up in this cottage
[SPEAKER_01]: and they had and so that was back then you
could sell outdoor really easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were doing these crazy outdoors
in these swamps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was all it was kind of like I'd
almost describe it as a land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were kind of back and forth
between that Nelson area and BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'd kind of have like the best
outdoor stuff that was going around
[SPEAKER_01]: Nelson.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were crossing it all with their
own stuff, which was all pretty Mighty
[SPEAKER_01]: Might.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would go off really early,
like you'd start harvesting in like July.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was like it was kind of like a land
race.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would pop like, you know,
1500 or 2000 seeds and grow them out in
[SPEAKER_01]: all these swamps.
[SPEAKER_01]: All over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and they'd basically start harvesting
like July, the first ones would come and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd go all the way into like the first
week of October.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like very that's why I kind of
call it like a Canadian land race because
[SPEAKER_01]: it was just diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them were really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can never get away with it then
because you sell bags of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember one of my buddies used to
wholesale bags and he's like, I can't take
[SPEAKER_01]: any more of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, one guy tells me how great it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next guy's telling me it doesn't
do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was because it was all from seed
and some of it was the auto flower stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that was not strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that anyway, so at the time that was
when I was writing for Cannabis Culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark Henry's magazine, I was writing for
the Cannabis Culture magazine and I wrote
[SPEAKER_01]: an article about auto flowers because at
the time I found it frustrating because
[SPEAKER_01]: there was definitely like some like super
good auto flowers, but like decent quality
[SPEAKER_01]: like flower for the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you could sell it wholesale.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wrote an article about auto
flowers and it focused a lot on Mighty
[SPEAKER_01]: Might.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time there was literally not a
single auto flower on the market other
[SPEAKER_01]: than a few of those Mighty Mights coming
out of market and receipts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like other than that, I don't think a
single thing had been released since
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville or at least those first ones like
back in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess, sorry, Stency still would
have had that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're crappy, whatever it was called
that nobody bought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ruderalis Skunk and Ruderalis NL.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was kind of frustrated because I was
like, no, like this is actually has
[SPEAKER_01]: potential to auto flower stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wrote that article.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like in a year that all of a
sudden you started, that was kind of when
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the lowrider came up and then
Europe all started doing auto flowers and
[SPEAKER_01]: then I never wanted to bother with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they, yeah, they all, it became a big
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly think I'd lay bets if you trace
that back, whether it came from Mighty
[SPEAKER_01]: Might or something else, I would lay bets
that came out of Canadian genetics because
[SPEAKER_01]: we were the only people really doing it
much back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm pretty certain
that the timing all made sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: What didn't make sense to me was,
if I remember correctly, lowrider,
[SPEAKER_03]: the dude, joint doctor, or whoever was the
one that was originally saying they bred
[SPEAKER_03]: it, they said it was from a Mexican,
just random Mexican.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I don't know, you know,
like, cause I remember growing early
[SPEAKER_03]: sativa from Canadian bred seeds and there
were a few other ones and they were
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely, they definitely had some good
auto flowering traits back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there wasn't a lot being marketed at
the time for auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that's been pretty consistent in
weed is obscuring the origin of where your
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff came from for a variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the more disappointing
things of weed is when I've kind of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I travel a lot through Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of, like just for work,
I've always traveled a lot and I've kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of, so I just know a lot of different
people and I've always kind of chased
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics a little bit and say whatever,
just when you, and when you dig into
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much everything, you're just like,
oh, it's just like another seed bank
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it's just renamed M39 or like there's
so, I can literally count on like one
[SPEAKER_01]: hand, how many like elite things or stuff
that have a great story that when you dig
[SPEAKER_01]: into them aren't, are anything actual,
unusual.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's typically it, you know,
and especially once you get past a certain
[SPEAKER_03]: point in the years too, it gets much
worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you're starting to realize
that you're buying everything comes from
[SPEAKER_03]: one Spanish seed company during certain
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that if you're buying Dutch
stuff and it did take a big change and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's gotten much worse over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I guess that's why a lot of
us are still chasing some of these old
[SPEAKER_03]: ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not necessarily because we think
they're more dank, but the genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity is a lot better than just gelato
times gelato or cookies times cookies
[SPEAKER_03]: times cookies times cookies or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time to get back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was definitely some stuff when I
think back that just was really unique
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to what's around whether people
would actually care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but it was definitely
unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I really don't place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pardon me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unique definitely has a place now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think at least among some circles that
are left.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I think of what's actually that I've
tried, that's unique over the years,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's always, and I'm not like a big
sativa, you know, dude, but it's usually
[SPEAKER_01]: sativa stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like more equatorial stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of distinct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I think back to like,
growing up, it was like the Jamaican was
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of the Jamaican import we'd always
get was definitely like pretty unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just kind of stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I think a lot of the cushions
and indicas are pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure somewhere in Afghanistan,
there's some different stuff, but
[SPEAKER_01]: everything I've really tried in that realm
all seems pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that regard, I mean, and maybe some
of that, too, is just because sativas are
[SPEAKER_00]: the rarest thing to get worked because
indicas are definitely like easier to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're shorter and they're thicker
and they yield more and they're more prone
[SPEAKER_00]: for ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they kind of a lot of sativa sort of
missed like this inbreeding era of the
[SPEAKER_00]: last 20 plus years, I think, you know,
they weren't they weren't as big of a
[SPEAKER_00]: proponent of all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's it's pretty noticeable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one of my best friends grows out of
I would argue probably more sativas than
[SPEAKER_01]: almost anyone like in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's just a hobby guy, but he's just
always like he pops by that he probably
[SPEAKER_01]: pops like a couple of thousand seeds a
year of all like landrace or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the ties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try a lot of stuff from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really noticeable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just how like, unimproved it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's just like a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, that totally has like
potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just like, when you really think
of like, it's just really unworked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like doesn't have like,
it's just there's a lot of things missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, well, man, if somebody
worked on this for 30 years, which is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's a restart what a lot of
those cushions have been worked on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows what crazy stuff that could come
out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just find it's pretty unworked
because I try a lot of stuff from him and
[SPEAKER_01]: not very much of it is very appealing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, cannabis doesn't breed itself
naturally towards like getting humans high
[SPEAKER_03]: the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we see, you know, it tends to like try
to breed itself towards emptiness.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot, you know, there's a
there's a big landrace heirloom collection
[SPEAKER_03]: community.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see it on IG, you know,
like the people offering, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: strains directly from Afghanistan and
Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know that the larger community
in general understands what getting into
[SPEAKER_03]: landraces and heirloom lines truly means
and the kind of space you need to truly
[SPEAKER_03]: pick something wonderful out that many
people would enjoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a much bigger process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the thing that a lot of
younger people don't get is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I've grown up some landraces,
but even like, if you look back to old
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, there used to be around even if
it's been desiccated, like if you go back
[SPEAKER_01]: to a lot of the seed banks, horrible
keepers out of packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, there was some great stuff
that came out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the consistency these days,
like you can buy most of the modern stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you could buy a pack of almost
anything and find like something great out
[SPEAKER_01]: of 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that was not the case back a
long time, you know, in pretty recent
[SPEAKER_01]: history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when I go through that, that sweet
clone that I grew out a lot of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was basically like, I'm pretty
sure it's just a plain old NLAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you pop like hybrids of that and
you see like a lot of like the old NL5
[SPEAKER_01]: expressions, which everyone always talks
about how great they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they were horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were super betraytous, susceptible,
it definitely has some nice stuff in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm like, I don't remember like the
last time I popped like a pack of modern
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and got something like rotted out on
the, you know, on the stem under normal
[SPEAKER_01]: grow room conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was pretty common back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I definitely think that I talk about
it quite a bit, like the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between like a low.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear Francis?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he's off-roading.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll probably pause it for a second
until he comes back since he's in the
[SPEAKER_03]: middle of something and then I'll cut it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: My connection has been cutting in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strangely, I don't know what the deal is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave a few seconds before you jump back
in so I can edit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I've definitely noticed that like a
lot of the original strains, you could
[SPEAKER_00]: find real gems in it, but it did take a
lot of hunting and a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure that like the modern seed
poppers would be comfortable going through
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that had so much junk and mids to
find the right thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to spend that time or space
anymore to find something that fills that
[SPEAKER_03]: modern market, like that palette.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a lot to go out of, ask someone to
go out of their way to do these massive
[SPEAKER_03]: pops.
[SPEAKER_03]: It costs money, time and space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's harder to sell now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like back then, I remember they could sell
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you popped out of that seed pack,
someone was lined up to buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I wouldn't want to try to move in
some of that stuff these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, I don't even know what you can
do with it and make extracts, I guess,
[SPEAKER_03]: but Brownies and extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now that we're getting into,
we talked a little bit about botrytis on
[SPEAKER_03]: buds and some of the stuff there.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of your specialties is IPM and we
really haven't covered a good IPM topic on
[SPEAKER_03]: the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to, I wanted to go over some
basic steps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the practices that you do to
keep your room clean, to really work on
[SPEAKER_03]: your IPM.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to talk about some of your
basics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of like, I worked in the
commercial or greenhouse industry for like
[SPEAKER_01]: a long time, like three years or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most, a lot of what I've done is in
integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_01]: So also I would say, don't always take
lessons from me on how to do stuff because
[SPEAKER_01]: I work in that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go through stages where sometimes I'm
like a super disease-a-phobe and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to take anything in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and other times I'm like,
whatever, if I get something, I want to,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really care that much if I get
something in because I want to like figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out, like make sure I know what I'm
talking about with getting rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only ones that honestly,
out of all the ones that I see,
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones that is just like really like the
number one thing I say is just don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's the easiest thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like thrips and spider mites to me,
they're pretty easy to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that are just like, they're,
they're disastrous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, is, I mean, powder mildew is,
it's doable, but it's, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, anyone has had it, it's pretty hard
to shake, especially if you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the worst ones is cannabis aphid in
the root aphid, just because they're,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's just, unless you're going to go
with a, they're easy to get rid of with a
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic, like a systemic, but if you're
like legal and you can't do that or you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to do that, they're essentially
impossible to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean that, and that's the one I
always find so frustrating because people,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like they're, you know, aphids are
big, like you can see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even need a hand lens,
like a magnifying glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see them with your naked eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen, I've personally seen
multiple times where people have literally
[SPEAKER_01]: like brought in like some stupid clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely wasn't worth the hassle and
ended up with like, you know, something
[SPEAKER_01]: that costs them millions and millions of
dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they basically never get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I actually just had a recent one that
I've kind of moving, so I'm kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: shutting down on my, like, so I'm not
finishing out my flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, okay, well I'm just
holding mothers for like the next,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, probably a year or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I got to, you know, sell my house
and move and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, I'm going to start catching
some clones that people owe me or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now's the time I'll add them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I don't really care whatever,
if somebody sticks me, I got a year to
[SPEAKER_01]: clean it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I got, and everyone that's given me
a clone recently is going to be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because I'll tell everyone I've gotten
a whole bunch of clones from different
[SPEAKER_01]: people in the last month or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might not have been you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But somebody gave me powdery mildew on one
of them that they told me didn't have any.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had left them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had gone traveling for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was fine and I left it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went back and I kind of left my
wife in charge and I came back and that
[SPEAKER_01]: one clone had blown up and gone
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I got mildew everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one's fresh and in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the one that I think causes a
lot of people, a lot of, there's a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't really understand what's going
on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they think it's systemic,
which is a chance it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think mostly what happens where you
get it and they're like, I just can't
[SPEAKER_01]: shake it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just because once you get spores
everywhere in your room, they're basically
[SPEAKER_01]: impossible to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they last for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've seen, I've seen that a bunch of
times where people, they think they've got
[SPEAKER_01]: it all under control and then bang,
like six months later, PM starts up again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's really, it might've
been that it was in some, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of their plants just had a bit living
on it that they didn't catch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think a lot of times it's just
there's spores everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sooner or later you kick up a spore
and it germinates on your plant and bang,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in that situation, I'd lay bets that
what had happened is that plant that I
[SPEAKER_01]: brought in from my buddy was covered in
spores and the spores kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they germinate on the plant and
then they kind of have a little taproot
[SPEAKER_01]: that goes down into the plant that's
called a historium that basically like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of like roots for powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just like kind of sits there and it
spreads like it's mycelium kind of across
[SPEAKER_01]: the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's growing on the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what triggers powdery mildew,
like what people notice is when it spores,
[SPEAKER_01]: when it sporulates, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times what people think it's
like a humidity thing, but usually when it
[SPEAKER_01]: actually sporulates, it's a stress event.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's either, that's why you see it in
like peak flowering, all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll see a whole room go off with mildew
you didn't think you had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, while I was traveling,
you know, in Canada, usually when it
[SPEAKER_01]: switches from kind of summer to fall,
it'll go from like 85% relative humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: on average down to like 35 when the cool
front hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I think happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a cool front hit while I was
traveling and bang, this thing went off.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife didn't see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing I know I've got mildew all
over the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely like those ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess my biggest thing is I'm usually
pretty careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like definitely if I was running a
commercial thing, I would be way the heck
[SPEAKER_01]: more careful than pretty much everybody in
what I bring in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much all the time where it
comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's people importing clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, the one that just really gets
me, it's the aphids, it's the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: aphid especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're just so easy to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think especially with the legal
stuff, people start bringing in like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, more cuttings at a time than
they can look through properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it only takes one aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, like one cannabis
aphid in three weeks can take down like a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole garden basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it really, they reproduce that
quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the PM, what in Canada, I,
you know, cause I know down here,
[SPEAKER_03]: like our crew tends to use like micronized
sulfur spray, but I don't even know like
[SPEAKER_03]: in the legal market, if that's something
they can even use up in Canada,
[SPEAKER_03]: is that something you guys use there or do
you have a different routine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, they can use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically what they're limited to,
and again, cause I kind of work in both,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked for a long time in also like
commercial vegetables and commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been, I kind of know what's dealt
with in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's different with cannabis is in
any other crop, it's always controlled by
[SPEAKER_01]: a combination of systemic fungicides and
stuff like sulfur and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium bicarbonate or like bacillus
subtilis or stuff, like some of the common
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we've got stuck with in Canada,
good or bad, I don't really have a comment
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's good or bad, but it makes it
challenging is there's no like systemic
[SPEAKER_01]: fungicides registered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically once you take the systemic
out, you're just dealing with surface
[SPEAKER_01]: level, other than sulfur, maybe you're
just dealing with surface level controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, like, you know,
people will use like, I think rhapsody is
[SPEAKER_01]: one, like a bacillus subtilis,
which is like a bacterial one that people,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a common one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they use on both sides of the
border and it works great, but it only
[SPEAKER_01]: controls like the surface level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, and so it's not controlling that
our story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's down in that little root.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's down into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically you can kill everything on
the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that little roots is going to
keep it's just, you know, a week later,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to pop up and slowly spread
again and you won't see it until it
[SPEAKER_01]: sporulates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically what they're stuck with in
any of the legal places is just spraying
[SPEAKER_01]: every week to keep them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you've got mildew in your facility,
they just spray every week with,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually they rotate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got, I think there's a hydrogen
peroxide type spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a potassium bicarbonate spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of like oil type sprays,
which again, these are all just ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just like, they control the
surface level.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that really has any
systemic effect is sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one that people, and I honestly
don't know the real answer to this bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say for sure all the cleanest
growers that I've seen in the legal market
[SPEAKER_01]: use a lot of sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use sulfur literally some of them use
it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use sulfur pots right till harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that's good or bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will argue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally wouldn't use it that far.
[SPEAKER_01]: They argue if you look at the sulfur
tests, like the leaf, like the tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis, there's still not enough sulfur
in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's their argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just like, it's just a plant
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still not up to optimal levels,
even with the pots burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble man, and I honestly just don't know
which is true on this bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of people will say that
the sulfur gets into and will destroy the
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor, which I could definitely see,
you know, what sulfur is like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just gets into everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bubble man back years ago,
he used to be the buyer at the Vancouver
[SPEAKER_01]: compassion club.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was his big thing was he would
make hash with it and you could smell the
[SPEAKER_01]: salt, tell whether somebody had used a
fender on their crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say definitely some of that
that's been bullshit because I've
[SPEAKER_01]: literally smoked that guy that the one of
the big LPs that I've known for a fact
[SPEAKER_01]: runs literally until harvest day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought some of their pink Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally, I know exactly what was done to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bought it from the legal store.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was covered in sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally am sus a little sus on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sulfur is definitely like the most
effective thing out of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what I find that kind of gets is
a little bit dumb is like, we had,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you guys did to a whole Michael
butanol thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first went legal, there's a few
people's it's called Nova up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember what you guys call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a bunch of guys got caught using that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's this whole thing about how it
makes like some, you know, when you smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: Eagle 20, it makes this cyanide,
I think it was some, some super toxic
[SPEAKER_01]: sounding thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then if you look in, and I'm not
telling people to go use Eagle 20,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm just saying, I think it's been
blown up.
[SPEAKER_01]: a little a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at like the, the chemical
that they were all talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cannabis already produces it like
1000 times the level that was in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael butanol spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't I'm not advocating that people
use Michael butanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying that that is how it's
controlled on other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would argue like, I personally
wouldn't have a problem doing clones with
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael butanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like knowing, like, I personally
wouldn't have a problem cleaning up
[SPEAKER_01]: mother's stock with Michael butanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never use it in flowering stuff
like that, even though we eat it all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time, like 100% of all your foods covered
in this stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we got some weird stuff there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same kind of thing with aphids in
Canada, where it's really easy to get
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen both with Michael butanol and
with aphid systemic chemicals,
[SPEAKER_01]: where I've seen people test clean pretty
not that far after they've done that
[SPEAKER_01]: application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it literally makes like it's literally
with cannabis aphids, it seems like one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those dumb things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen like these LPs that literally
spent like, you know, $13 million on
[SPEAKER_01]: biocontroller for a year to control
cannabis aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they could have literally controlled
them with like one, you know, Endeavor
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment for like a penny or something
like that you get it seems like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten a little bit crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's like, okay, who who really cares
if it tests as long as it tests clean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you really care whether somebody used
it in their mother's stock?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of always a pretty big IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really believe in pure
biocontroller pure chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of believe in both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always see a big problem with a lot of
some of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's test if you're testing it and it's
clean at the end of the day, who cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the issue with that with that what
happens is any of those powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's just a general issue with a lot of
chemicals is stuff gets resistant to them
[SPEAKER_01]: really quick there is back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just saying not so like what so
what happens with stuff like that is it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just when you're spraying it too
frequently, it just gets resistant to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what so Canada's got a lot more
stringent pesticide laws than the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've kind of always used a lot more,
you know, biocontrol and like micro
[SPEAKER_01]: biopesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that where they would use if you look
at a conventional cucumber crop that gets
[SPEAKER_01]: a huge amount like way more mildew than
the cannabis crop gets, they would always
[SPEAKER_01]: rotate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll sit there and they'll spray
potassium bicarbonate or like these soft
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, which you can't get resistant to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't get result for you can't get
resistant to potassium bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll spray those every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every once in a while,
they'll throw in a Nova that kind of just
[SPEAKER_01]: knocks the crap out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how they manage the resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with biocontrols, like you were
talking about, you know, your spider
[SPEAKER_01]: resorbites.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how a lot a lot of crops are just
they use the biocontrols to spread out how
[SPEAKER_01]: often they're going to do the spray
treatment just to keep them much more
[SPEAKER_01]: effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, and in Mendo, as well,
20 years ago, you could spray people would
[SPEAKER_00]: use abamectin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people call it avid or whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would spray it once and they
wouldn't see a two spot for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people got to the point where
they would spray, they would dip their
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings in it every run.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would overuse it to a point where
there's a lot of mites in Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: California that are immune to quite a
number of the harsher chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, like like like Darrell was
saying, I mean, the main introduction is
[SPEAKER_03]: by bringing in new clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're only seen it once a year,
it's probably because they're only
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing in new clones once a year to
replace the old stock and bringing in the
[SPEAKER_03]: new spider mites with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for spider mites specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, Darrell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say for spider mites
and maybe maybe it's different because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're definitely in California is a very
agricultural and intense area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but where I where I live, I live in an
area that's basically the size of like
[SPEAKER_01]: Ukiah, but it's it's got the like 3000
acres of greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like solid greenhouses and
lots of different people own them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's it's I would argue,
at least as agriculturally intensive as
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendo is, and everyone's spraying
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've seen a bunch of times,
like I'll tell you, a friend of mine owns
[SPEAKER_01]: a big cucumber greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had the same story that not so
saying basically, like when I first was
[SPEAKER_01]: going in there, he was literally like tank
mixing like, you know, six times the rate
[SPEAKER_01]: of avid with 10 times the rate of
fluoromite, something literally,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even making those numbers up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was crazy amounts of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and that would basically buy him like
five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he was just in a mad panic spraying
over and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he switched to using bio control
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within three months, you could and
again, I'll just elaborate on this a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But within three months, you could go in
there with a regular rate of fluoromite or
[SPEAKER_01]: a regular rate of avid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looked like he dropped a nuclear
bomb in there, like you'd spray once and
[SPEAKER_01]: it would just like wipe everything out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's two things that can kind of
go on with pest populations is the
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of what I've seen, especially
with spider mites, is like it's a it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: short term selection pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as you take that selection
pressure, which may be a spring avid all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time away for a while, there's nothing
selecting for that in the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just goes back to being susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do get sometimes if you look at other
pests like white flies, a good example
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a type of white fly from down from
southwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes from southwestern U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes from those really
agricultural intense areas where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting sprayed a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in those cases, there's a lot of
resistance to insecticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually become fixed in the
population where it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like every single one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like if you're breeding auto flowers
and you got to the point where everything
[SPEAKER_01]: is auto flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't bring that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I haven't seen that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with mites, I have not seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it with white fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely could happen with other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the resistance is generally
local.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's generally because the like the people
on that farm have been overusing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I what I find in Mendo is when
because spider mites breed more rapidly
[SPEAKER_00]: when the temperatures go up and the
humidity goes down, people tend to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, especially inside and stuff like
that, they really tend to get beat up in
[SPEAKER_00]: summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they tend to get ahead in winter
and they lose again in summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and then there's a lot of
things, too, where people used to overuse
[SPEAKER_00]: all those chemicals, especially when in
the two fifteen era, the clubs only tested
[SPEAKER_00]: for parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: People had it figured out, like how close
you could use certain chemicals and still
[SPEAKER_00]: test clean when you took your product in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they moved it to parts per
billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that changed things a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and so now, obviously,
all those things are banned and you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: use them at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, people have have gone to
biocontrol or they've gone to pet,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've gone to bugs, they've gone to like
simpler methods, I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: with varying degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely what.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely what's happened in
Canada with the legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just generally everyone uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much like there's definitely some
people spraying some nasty stuff in the
[SPEAKER_01]: black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of them are pretty they use they
they're pretty IBM, like using a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one that I just find there's just
there's some things that biocontrol just
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have a great answer to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis aphid is one that is to say
it has great answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's tons of stuff that will
control cannabis aphid really well there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll never get rid of them to
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it gets expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some that I'm just like,
I certainly just can't envision,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, long term, not like there's just not
going to be a biocontrol that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: control them cost effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, there's a couple like
that, but most of them are pretty pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think probably what you've got going on
in Mendo is a climate thing, too,
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's just really 100 percent bad
climate, like where where it'd be hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: make biocontrols work properly because you
got really low humidity all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sorry, the other thing I was going to
mention with the spider mites,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the most common things that I see
is spider mites, they go into hibernation
[SPEAKER_01]: under short days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they go into what's called diapause.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically what I see happen is
really common is to get bad spider mites
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they think they got rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just, you know, a whole bunch of the
population is just like hiding,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in their electrical outlets and,
you know, any little crevice in your room.
[SPEAKER_01]: In diapause, and they'll do that,
like, kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, they're going to go cycle
just in and out of diapause.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they might disappear for like two
months up into your room somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you think it's all clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're like, where did all these
spider mites come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, diapause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis aphids, I can say for Mendo,
it's really the first new pest that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen in probably the last, you know,
them and russet mites, honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: are the two new things that have come
along really within the last like five to
[SPEAKER_00]: seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and cannabis aphids,
I've had experience with lots of other
[SPEAKER_00]: types of aphids before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis aphids just breed so unbelievably
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all female and they all are
pregnant and their embryos have embryos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just replicate at such a rate like
you were saying, there's lots of things
[SPEAKER_00]: that kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you miss a couple and give it a few
weeks and they'll be back to crazy levels
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just like there, I don't think most
people describe, I can't tell people
[SPEAKER_01]: enough times, like, don't get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're literally the worst thing you
could ever have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so I'll give you an example of just
how bad they are, is I had just on a
[SPEAKER_01]: personal growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was doing some, we were doing some
trials somewhere for work for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I must have had to come from here,
but I must have ended up with one on my
[SPEAKER_01]: clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it couldn't have been more than one or
two aphid because I don't even think like
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never walk right from a place like
that into my grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But somehow, a cannabis aphid can,
that was the only place it could have come
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis aphid can only go from
cannabis plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're like, whatever, living in
somewhere where there's no cannabis plants
[SPEAKER_01]: around and you got cannabis aphid,
you brought them in on cuttings 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like someone dumb like me brought them
in on their clothes from a place that had
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time, so I was just playing
around with everything and you could
[SPEAKER_01]: control them to kind of like low,
you could keep them at a dull roar pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: easily with soaps or biocontrols or like
we were using Lacewing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a bunch of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't hard to keep them fairly under
control, but to get rid of them was next
[SPEAKER_01]: to impossible because you literally have
to get rid of every single one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I literally had to take my entire
collection down to like four little clones
[SPEAKER_01]: and spray them almost to death with soap
to get rid of them until they were
[SPEAKER_01]: entirely clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on a commercial thing, it's basically
impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could never, I don't think it's
possible to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing I would say that I have seen
and I don't know what the exact answer to
[SPEAKER_01]: them is, is heat treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the crop in, the only people I've
seen actually get rid of them completely
[SPEAKER_01]: by heat treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe if you can back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why they're so bad compared to,
you know, a lot of people you'll get like
[SPEAKER_01]: an aphids on your cannabis crop and then
they don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like pretty common.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of pests are, they're adapted to
the crop species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, on tomatoes, don't get a
whole lot of aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most times on a tomato crop in a
greenhouse, you'll get aphids that'll come
[SPEAKER_01]: in and they just don't, they kind of get
going a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they need to disappear by themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because they don't like the host
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every once in a while you'll get one
that's adapted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's like, look out, it's
basically the same as cannabis aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with cannabis aphid, it's just highly
adapted to that crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as they get going, they'll go
like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, if you go back to the heat
treatment, that's one of the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually came from the black market where,
I don't know, but in general, but I was
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of spread that around in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got it from the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew some black market people that were
getting, you can get these heaters that
[SPEAKER_01]: they use in hotel rooms to kill bed bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically if you heat up a room to
like, you know, about 45 or 50 Celsius for
[SPEAKER_01]: about five hours, it'll kill everything
that's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some guys were in the black market,
were playing around for that for broad
[SPEAKER_01]: night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't work by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also played it ended up playing
around with it for cannabis aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does work pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thing is, like, you can really
crack in those temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guys that I know that have figured
it out, obviously, they won't tell anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: they did, but it's something to do with
heat treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something with playing around
with like those high temperatures,
[SPEAKER_01]: like 45 Celsius or something for a few
hours, enough to make them all dehydrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's definitely answers that I think
will get figured out because I've
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely seen a few people that that
have done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, for most people, I'm like,
just take a good look at your cutting
[SPEAKER_01]: before you bring that into your your place
because they spread so quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they they can actually in
California, they transfer by air,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, from just different because
there's so many outdoor gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what happened to us is it was
Oregon's fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Oregon had hundreds and hundreds of
acres of hemp once we made hemp legal
[SPEAKER_00]: through the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the hemp market, the CBD market
collapsed and people had literally
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of acres of hemp that was going
to be worthless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they didn't implement any IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these cannabis aphids took
over and just replicated at a rate that
[SPEAKER_00]: was never before seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they just started spreading like
wildfire from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, that's exactly what's
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis aphid needs to go from a
cannabis plant to a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally, it's I've seen most of the
time it's from cut is from imported
[SPEAKER_01]: cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can definitely get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, when they they don't usually
have wings, but when they run out of food,
[SPEAKER_01]: a food source or that gets too many,
they'll develop wings and fly somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, if you've got a lot of growers
near you, or hemp fields and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll get flyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Root aphids actually worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at least with those ones, like with
cannabis aphid, you're like, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, at least if you know if you're away
from everybody else, or if you screen your
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse or screen your grow room,
like do a good job in your garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're probably not going to get them in,
even if you can screen them, probably not
[SPEAKER_01]: getting them in your grow room from like a
hemp field, unless you're like intaking
[SPEAKER_01]: directly out of the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: But root aphids, the problem is they're
actually worse because they're an actual
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a widespread pest that lives on a
lot of different plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get root aphids from I don't
know, all the host species, but you can
[SPEAKER_01]: just get them from like weeds inside your
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's but it's interesting,
because I'm the same thing is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I grew up, most of the time it was
just like, it was, you know, trips and
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mites up until PM, the whole PM
outbreak kind of blew up, I'm guessing
[SPEAKER_01]: probably on 2000s or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all these new ones, the,
you know, hemp rust that might cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: aphid, root aphid, and then obsolete and
viroid, they're all like, came out of a
[SPEAKER_01]: legal thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just from increased sharing of
genetics material for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very poor practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was people stopping maintaining
their own mothers and then, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: buying and trading amongst their small
group of friends, and then going to
[SPEAKER_00]: centralized locations like dispensaries,
or stores or nurseries, and just for the
[SPEAKER_00]: ease of getting their plant stock
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, originally, originally,
what we saw was just from people trick,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was just, you know, black market
channels opened up more and we were
[SPEAKER_01]: sharing clones a lot more than they used
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like, for instance, in that,
that Nelson DC area, that was where hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: rust, it might first showed up in Canada
that I saw, and that was from clones that
[SPEAKER_01]: came out of Colorado, that got brought up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd say in Canada, where the bigger
problem has been, it's, it's, the nursery
[SPEAKER_01]: thing was kind of stage two of that,
where now, because it's so legal,
[SPEAKER_01]: most people are buying from nurseries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, whatever that I do,
hype clone is, you got to get it from this
[SPEAKER_01]: one nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think people are buying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, dude, don't buy it from that
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're going to get all kinds of
stuff and they buy it anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden they've got,
you know, cannabis, a food pops late and
[SPEAKER_01]: then everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely been the second wave is
those, those legal nurseries, which is,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what you guys are seeing in
California a lot too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was what I was going to comment on
was the legal nursery aspect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, different, different
nurseries, specifically in California,
[SPEAKER_03]: when a hype strain would go off,
there would be one, one major clone
[SPEAKER_03]: nursery supplying millions of those clones
to all the different dispensaries out
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if HLV was just in one, it takes no
effort at all to just ruin every room that
[SPEAKER_03]: it touches.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's been a massive explosion.
[SPEAKER_03]: The secondary nurseries, the legal
nurseries, all that major pathogen vector.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing with, with tops late and is
it's, and again, I've never dealt,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a bunch of buddies that have had
it pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of know I've dealt with other
like, uh, you know, vegetable crop viruses
[SPEAKER_01]: and starviroids that are similar to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fine lines are usually really easy to
control because the nice thing about them
[SPEAKER_01]: is like, they can't persist outside of
like plant saps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not going to just sit on your
like, you know, floor for a long period of
[SPEAKER_01]: time and then re-infect like a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you see those people that it's
just like everything in their shipping is
[SPEAKER_01]: got hops late and voyeur, like they're
doing something seriously wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just, really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I think happened is, uh, people,
you know, uh, people would use similar
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors or similar razors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or, you know, uh, cloning would spread
it really badly, I think in a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: nurseries and it would go from being on
just a few plants to being on hundreds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost all the hops late and by right in
my opinion, there's definitely some that's
[SPEAKER_01]: been spread from seed, but I think the
vast majority has just been spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: From, you know, some dude using the same
cutting knife on everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to be how it's, it's rapidly
spread and the water, uh, liquid contact
[SPEAKER_03]: between root systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like that's another vector.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, that was a new one that I heard when
on your guys, when you had that lady on,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm like, man, that makes it wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't doubt it either, but I'm like,
man, that was a lot worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've watched it happen in action.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she, you know, one of the
interesting things she brought up was just
[SPEAKER_00]: how like leaf tissue, it could be hit or
miss whether or not it showed up on
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, but root tissue, it was like a
hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had it, it was going to show up on
if you ripped off some roots and tested
[SPEAKER_00]: those, um, and how it moved through the
plant, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and we've definitely had buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called it gutting back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it was hop late,
but we definitely have had buddies that
[SPEAKER_00]: like it ripped through their whole scene
basically through runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was what that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was how we got that one's new to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, that was a really good episode that
you had like that interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had some really interesting
information and I hadn't, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: heard before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It totally makes sense, but that's,
uh, it's, it's kind of different,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, thing because most, it's not something
you see in a lot of other cases because
[SPEAKER_01]: for instance, like in, you know,
greenhouse vegetables, everything's
[SPEAKER_01]: getting run through like all the run,
like they do research, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's getting, it's, there's not a
lot, the way they're set up, everything
[SPEAKER_01]: just goes right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're all in rock wall slabs
and it just basically goes directly out of
[SPEAKER_01]: that one slab into the, you know,
the runoff cat gutter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it gets run through like ozone
treatment and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not getting viruses
recirculating like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's kind of like a, it's partly
to do with how a lot of people are set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely takes a window to like no-till
dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're, when you're like,
well crap, you get obsolete and viroid in
[SPEAKER_01]: there once and you're basically stuck with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, there was a, um, there was a thing,
you know, the DNA was part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, and they had, they were one of the
first people that had like huge greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: scenes in Salinas, California,
when legal first happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did all these like two foot deep,
five foot wide, a hundred foot long beds
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere and all these greenies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they brought in root aphids on their
plants, very first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they basically infected these living
soil beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: With root aphids and then they struggled
for a couple of years and then they went
[SPEAKER_00]: to one gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they couldn't get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, I personally wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one of my good friends is a big
living soil guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've actually seen him for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen root aphids in his place and
they've never gotten going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't think he ever gets rid of
them, but they don't actually cause him
[SPEAKER_01]: any problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I think it is because the living
soil kind of keeps them in check.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, I don't, I don't know a
hundred percent on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing I would say on hops late and
by right though is like one of my friends,
[SPEAKER_01]: he runs a legal place.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first one in Canada that I
saw that got it really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they had to like shut down the whole,
they had like a new startup, got it all
[SPEAKER_01]: rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did like one crop and we're like,
what the heck is going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they couldn't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they finally, they were, there was
before anyone really knew what hops late
[SPEAKER_01]: and by right is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, dude, it was a disaster for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, but he's like, it was actually super
easy to control.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, literally, as soon as you got
rid of the, they literally just got rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: all the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't even sanitize.
[SPEAKER_01]: They literally threw all the plants out,
waited a week, put fresh plants from a
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue culture and they've never had them
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, you could easily,
pardon me, Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sometimes that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some of our friends just said,
throw it out, start over the quickest way
[SPEAKER_03]: through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, it depends on your setup
probably now that you've got that whole
[SPEAKER_01]: runoff thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I set up on Rockwell cubes and they
probably had like a research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, it's pretty standard in a lot
of the setups to have ozone in line that
[SPEAKER_01]: kills anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to limit how much it's going
to spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he said he could easily, he's like,
if I had to do it again, I wouldn't even
[SPEAKER_01]: have pulled the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I just would have like watched,
you know, maybe did a good job testing his
[SPEAKER_01]: mother's and then just go, no,
that one's got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's just, he's just like,
just from sanitation, like don't use the
[SPEAKER_01]: same knife from plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, I'm totally confident that
I could have done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's the one of the guys I know you
were talking about whether it could come
[SPEAKER_01]: from seed or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen firsthand the lab tests that he
got.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was what was kind of sad about
that whole thing is that dude threw out
[SPEAKER_01]: his whole clone collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he started that license place,
because he was worried about bringing in
[SPEAKER_01]: some weird pest or virus, bought in all
fresh Cali seed and started that whole
[SPEAKER_01]: legal place from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where his obsolete environment
came from, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he showed me pest packs of like tests
from some of the packs that he got,
[SPEAKER_01]: they tested positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no doubt, some of them are
getting transferred.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brutal, brutal, brutal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, she also mentioned, or I think
someone in the chat at the time mentioned
[SPEAKER_03]: pollen and it traveling on pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't, I had never even taken that
into consideration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I doubted nail pollen transfer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's possible,
but I probably would.
[SPEAKER_00]: For somebody like me who keeps a lot of,
a lot of old, a lot of old clones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: not currently popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to get people to back them
up for you and help, because if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: not a financial incentive, they're not
particularly interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really scary because there's,
there's some things that are really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: that aren't very well spread out and can
get ruined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, we have good friends of ours
that lost some pretty old and some pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: rare things before the hop latent thing
was even known.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just called it dudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people didn't know what precautions to
take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm pretty worried about the
combination of root aphids and russets and
[SPEAKER_00]: hop latent and, and even stuff like,
you know, the, the root aphids can spread
[SPEAKER_00]: hop latent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that that's, I think they
probably can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that that's actually been
proven a hundred percent of you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so either, but I wouldn't
put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of kind of myths about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I, my understanding is something like
thrips or spider mites is really,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not, thrips are virus carriers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from my understanding from this
actually came from one of the someone
[SPEAKER_01]: that's like PhD guys in, in virology,
like no way more than I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They told me that there's the chance of
thrips carrying hops latent viroid is
[SPEAKER_01]: almost next to nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think aphids is definitely quite likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if it's like to me, everyone's
right now, everyone's so caught up in hops
[SPEAKER_01]: latent viral.
[SPEAKER_01]: They forget that there's a million other
viruses out there that are just as bad
[SPEAKER_01]: that for sure aphids carry and thrips
carry some of them too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But aphids are probably the number one
like virus vector in agricultural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we've been getting, there's this stuff
that's been spreading around beet curly
[SPEAKER_00]: top virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets spread by, it gets spread by
leaf hoppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, and that's one of actually one
of one thing I'll mention, cause I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it matters is, you know, in the,
in the old days when everybody was hiding
[SPEAKER_00]: in, in, in small and medium size indoors
and everybody was up in the Hills and
[SPEAKER_00]: tucked away.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this stuff didn't spread so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that we've gone legal and people
are going into all these traditional ag
[SPEAKER_00]: areas to grow cannabis, all those
traditional ag areas are rife with things
[SPEAKER_00]: that cannabis hasn't really grown next to
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the things I don't think
people, like I said, I live in a really
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural intense area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically the area is all just
greenhouses and corn fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like it's, we've got, I think it's 97%
clear cut for agriculture where I live.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's interesting is I've seen it play
out a bunch of times, like for instance,
[SPEAKER_01]: like on tomatoes, tomatoes never used to
get thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So greenhouse tomatoes, they didn't get
thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden one year thrips
were like this massive issue on tomatoes
[SPEAKER_01]: and they never went away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just kept kind of continued.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you trace back what it was,
it was they'd started growing wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the fields around the
greenhouses, they were growing wheat and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'd got lots of pollen and thrips love
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, cause there's like a food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you get these giant levels of
thrips right beside your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you get a situation like that,
and I've seen this with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: different pests, most 99% of the thrips
don't like tomatoes, but sooner or later
[SPEAKER_01]: you get one that does and then,
or two that does, and then they breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden you've got thrips
adapted to tomatoes and that's a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: different story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's anytime you get agricultural
intense areas, that's what you get is
[SPEAKER_01]: these jumps of a pest that doesn't
necessarily normally like cannabis or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, that when you grow 10 gazillion
white fly right beside a cannabis crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: sooner or later, a couple like cannabis
and they have babies and then bang,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got a whole new pest complex to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just sounds like a never ending cycle
of pests, pests, pests, and probably more
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to be entering into our cannabis
sphere as it gets bigger, more corporate,
[SPEAKER_03]: more widespread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And goes into all those areas that have
all those different pests and then life
[SPEAKER_00]: adapts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the one interesting thing,
like a long time ago, I used to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: flower grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I used to work at a really like a
pretty big ornamental greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we grew like a lot of different types
of flowers, like different species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the more interesting things
that I saw there is we always had like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this type of, this variety that
always just was never happy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're growing so many different
things, you could never bake, nothing was
[SPEAKER_01]: ever perfect, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And one year we were just like,
we just took all the, we just did a broad
[SPEAKER_01]: sample for virus, for this specific virus,
just pretty, I would leave that as a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis one as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called INSV Impatient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Necrotic spot virus, and it's a thrips
spread virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was interesting is when we did a
broad analysis of like all of our plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the plants, pretty much all the plants
that we were like always having problems
[SPEAKER_01]: was like, I can't figure out why this one
won't grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or this one's always got pH problems,
it looks like, or this, they all had INSV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was all this like basically like 90%
of all of our, what we thought was plant
[SPEAKER_01]: cultural problems was actually vetted out
of virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And doesn't necessarily show the same all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would leave that as that's probably goes
on in cannabis a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a lot, that could be a lot
of what people call when people think
[SPEAKER_00]: about like genetic drift, or clones get
old and tired, and they don't want to root
[SPEAKER_00]: well anymore, and they don't want to grow
well anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could have just picked up some kind
of pathogen that they don't have a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: detect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I want to keep everything going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we're gonna have to do a whole
nother part two of this, because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna cut us off right at two hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I mean, I think we could do a
whole nother show at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: All this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there anything you want to plug
before we're done?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything you'd like to plug,
Dyer?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I got nothing to plug, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an enjoyable chat for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we could have kept going forever,
except it's gonna cut me off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really appreciate having you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dyer, we're definitely gonna have you back
if you'll have us back and you'll be back
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure everybody will be enjoying
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we appreciate all of your tips and
tricks with IPM.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the most requested things we
get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Natso, you got anything you want to
plug?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just always, I appreciate everybody's
time, everybody listening and tuning in as
[SPEAKER_00]: we explore different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, everyone.
See you next time.
