[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_01]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_01]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_01]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_01]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are The Syndicate.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your support.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to The Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I'm here with Yoni, the CEO of Plant
Cell Technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other day, I stumbled onto you through
a mutual friend and they were showing that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing embryonic rescue on seeds,
which fascinates me, all the breeders out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, people that are just genuinely
interested in seed collecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went in and looked like you guys were
competently doing embryonic rescue,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is something I've not seen yet
displayed, shown, really like you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fascinated me and I wanted to reach
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me a little bit about your company
and how it got started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant Cell Technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, Matt, it's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that you stumbled on our video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being competent is the baseline for what
we expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important to be professional and more
importantly to give people the resources
[SPEAKER_02]: and the opportunity to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of science is hidden behind closed
doors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think part of our mission is to
democratize tissue culture and make this
[SPEAKER_02]: more accessible to the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: On that point, Plant Cell Technology
started about 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: The origin story that a lot of people
don't know is we actually started as a toy
[SPEAKER_02]: company.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Pet Plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole idea was you could get three
different test tubes filled with gel and
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd get different seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would have a corn seed, you would have
a kalea seed, and you would have a tomato
[SPEAKER_02]: seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kids would be able to watch the plants
grow in the test tube, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the gel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun toy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like around the time pet rock was
a thing, pet everything, space monkeys or
[SPEAKER_02]: water monkeys, whatever you would call
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one problem with this toy is
that the gel kept getting contaminated.
[SPEAKER_02]: We developed plant preservative mixture,
which is the only EPA approved solution
[SPEAKER_02]: that protects the plants, doesn't hurt the
plants, but keeps bacteria and fungus
[SPEAKER_02]: outside of your cultures.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really what got us our foot in the
door into the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fast forward 30 years later, PPM is widely
used across the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an industry standard for most labs
and internationally especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we wanted to do is figure out a way
to bridge the gap between your
[SPEAKER_02]: bioengineers, your highly educated
scientists, and people that wanted to get
[SPEAKER_02]: into the space but might not have access.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started developing a series of videos,
education, classes to show people what we
[SPEAKER_02]: did in the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the R&D that we're doing behind
those doors?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the products that we're using to
be successful?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only are we going to provide you with
those products, but we're going to teach
[SPEAKER_02]: you how to use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we do service the largest commercial
tissue culture labs in the world,
[SPEAKER_02]: they know exactly what they're buying.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought that it's important to create
more education in the space, more videos,
[SPEAKER_02]: more content, and also break it down for
people that weren't necessarily learning
[SPEAKER_02]: from the scientific journals and papers
that they either might not have access to
[SPEAKER_02]: or might not understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I very much believe that plant tissue
culture is a trade skill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being able to work in a lab, being able to
be successful and mitigate contamination,
[SPEAKER_02]: and being a successful lab technician is
something that we should be training more
[SPEAKER_02]: people and giving more people the
opportunity because this is a very
[SPEAKER_02]: important skill.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I like to tell people, at least with
cannabis hemp specifically, we're only in
[SPEAKER_02]: the second or third inning of the ballgame
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The research is flooding in.
[SPEAKER_02]: The opportunities are expanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing an exciting wave now of
energy that people aren't just questioning
[SPEAKER_02]: whether or not TC is good for them,
but they're now trying to figure out how
[SPEAKER_02]: to do it for themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a little long monologue of how we
got started, but we really started from
[SPEAKER_02]: just a product company and now I try to
think of us as a collective or an
[SPEAKER_02]: all-in-one shop for plant tissue culture
with education, consulting, products,
[SPEAKER_02]: and support.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have this community that we've built
and hopefully continue to build that now
[SPEAKER_02]: you're a part of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining our video and hopefully
supporting many.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was smart and I don't usually get
motivated to hit people up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You two, I really don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome and it was well done.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of many.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of many and it's all free.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the beautiful part.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of paywalls behind this
information or people just don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about it, but we're here to tell you
as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some things are proprietary, obviously,
but something like when it comes to embryo
[SPEAKER_02]: rescue, that's a skill that I think
growers especially will be excited to
[SPEAKER_02]: learn about because how many seeds have
you thrown out in your lifetime?
[SPEAKER_01]: My God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between me and a few other breeders,
we have a large stock of some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: oldest seeds in cannabis history,
just sitting and waiting, not doing
[SPEAKER_01]: anything in fridges, just waiting for
people that have the skill to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people have pretended to,
we'll give them to them and nothing comes
[SPEAKER_01]: from it ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we can do with embryo rescue,
while we're not guaranteeing 100% results,
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing in science is ever 100%,
but if you do have old seeds, we've worked
[SPEAKER_02]: with seeds that are 30, 40 years old and
we've been able to germinate them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I can just dive right into embryo
rescue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_02]: At its core, majority of growers like to
pop seeds, feno hunt, look for new
[SPEAKER_02]: strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the big and common issues with
popping seeds is some of them just won't
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to germinate and people
throw them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortunately, due to plant tissue culture
and some of the skills developed in embryo
[SPEAKER_02]: rescue, this is actually, I want to give
credit to Bill Graham, the very first
[SPEAKER_02]: plant tissue culture in your kitchen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to call him the godfather of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's really perfected this skill and
taught us and now we're trying to teach
[SPEAKER_02]: the world as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we're doing is we're removing the
outer coat of the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes a 20, 30, four year old seed
doesn't have enough energy to germinate
[SPEAKER_02]: outside this coat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we do is we make a slight incision
after soaking it in like a hydrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: peroxide solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: For anybody that has questions on the
actual details or actual protocols on how
[SPEAKER_02]: to do it, we're happy to share those,
no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just feel free to reach out to Matt,
feel free to reach out to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll share the actual videos that we did,
but I'm giving you the broad strokes here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're cutting out the seed embryo and
inducing it in a nutrient rich medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we have here, for example,
this is a gel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's agar base.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is completely vegan made out of
seaweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this gel is mixed with a variety of
macros.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a proprietary formula that
we'll be launching soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun fact, and it works amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can see this little guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from 1121 Guava Tarts.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the seeds we actually popped on the
video, but it's rooting, it's looking
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful, it's looking great.
[SPEAKER_02]: This nutrient media is about three times
as rich in the macro micronutrients that
[SPEAKER_02]: plants desire as like traditional soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the seeds have not only the energy to
be able to germinate, but they're actually
[SPEAKER_02]: able to flourish, both root, develop
shoots quite vigorously.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is maybe 10 days after the
seed just wouldn't move if we planted it
[SPEAKER_02]: in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we've tried to share with growers
is that tissue culture is actually not a
[SPEAKER_02]: new tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been around since the sixties and
earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really started in the orchid industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every orchid that you buy in your Trader
Joe's or Walmart or grocery store is
[SPEAKER_02]: likely a clone and it's likely started in
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Orchids are very hard to germinate from
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tissue culture, asexual propagation has
been the go-to mechanism.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now, at least within the hemp and
cannabis space, we're trying to tell
[SPEAKER_02]: growers, you can adopt these same
technologies that have benefited some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the largest pharmaceutical companies in
the world, the largest agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: companies in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flower companies, we can apply that same
technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really right now being led by a
lot of the private sector, I'd say.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a few universities that can
legally work with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because of all the red tape and
bureaucracy, it's taking a lot more time
[SPEAKER_02]: than it should.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something like embryo rescue is one of
the easiest, I'd say, steps in the tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: culture process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I say easy, it's not that the
skill itself is easy, but the mechanism.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you learn how to do it,
you ride a bike, you're going to excel.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, this at its very simplest form
is, I'd say, step one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a grower, if you're a breeder
and you want to work with old seeds that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're scared won't germinate,
this is one of the best shots you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're cutting out that outer shell and
you're exposing it to that nutrient-rich
[SPEAKER_02]: media that needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the rest is just watching it grow
and putting it under light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you look at other kind of
techniques that you'll learn along the
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is from nodal culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that means is we're taking nodal
propagation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're taking the cutting from the
mother plant and we're using that
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient-rich media and we're letting it
flourish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from here, I would take this and
I'd acclimate it either in rockwool cubes
[SPEAKER_02]: or I would, yeah, probably rockwool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest thing that I would tell
growers or the biggest challenge they have
[SPEAKER_02]: is acclimating these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most plants need a hardening period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 10 to 12 days, right now this is close
to 100% humidity because there's a little
[SPEAKER_02]: vent right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's allowed to breathe, which means
humidity is slightly less.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you still want to adjust it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was to take this out and try to plant
it in soil, it's not going to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is an acclimation period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I like to tell growers is all
these skills can be obtained.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need a master's degree or a PhD
to do this, but you do need a will to fail
[SPEAKER_02]: and try again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people will fail when you
first start because contamination is a
[SPEAKER_02]: problem, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Learning aseptic technique, learning how
to work under a flow hood and how to avoid
[SPEAKER_02]: contamination risks is one of the biggest
challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, we've had classes where people
watch us do meristem dissection,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tell themselves they're scared
they're never going to be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after three or four tries,
they did it perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they did it once, they do it five,
six, seven times and nothing's scary
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've seen people from all age groups,
all skill levels succeed in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really just about commitment to
pushing through some of those challenges
[SPEAKER_02]: and also just asking questions,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If something doesn't work, why didn't it
work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it the lighting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it the media?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there a ventilation or no ventilation?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think a lot of people want kind of
instant answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the good news is, we're releasing all
in one media.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all you have to do is add water and
solidify.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if you want to do the research
and want to work through it, you can do
[SPEAKER_02]: that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where we can provide a guide
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have all the lists of PGRs that you can
access, all the different components that
[SPEAKER_02]: you would need to run your own
experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't need to sell the specific
products here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exciting kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're talking about it,
one of the first things you mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: early on was PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about what that means so
people understand what that means?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because most people would think that means
parts per million, like measuring stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: PPM, if you use fertilizers, you refer to
parts per million.
[SPEAKER_02]: So plant preservative mixture at its
simplest is a preservative that keeps out
[SPEAKER_02]: any bacteria or fungus from growing in
this test tube without damaging the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pesticides and herbicides and certain
fertilizers are sprayed on plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a way that we can avoid that
altogether.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's mixed in with the media.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's autoclaved.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would mix in the powder,
you mix in the water, you'd add PPM,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you'd autoclave it, and you're
good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what PPM does is if you make a
mistake, if you accidentally breathe or
[SPEAKER_02]: you might have touched your scalpel
before, you cut the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's giving you an extra layer of
insurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: These medias, as I mentioned earlier,
three times as nutrient rich as
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can imagine as much as the plant
loves it, bugs love it, bacteria love it,
[SPEAKER_02]: fungus loves it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So PPM is insurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're operating in a tissue culture lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're inevitably going to get
contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are very few, I would say,
I don't even know if there are any labs
[SPEAKER_02]: that never experienced contamination
across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humans are imperfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're bound to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially if you're doing thousands
of cultures a day, mistakes are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be made.
[SPEAKER_02]: So PPM is that extra layer of security.
[SPEAKER_02]: No bacteria or fungus is going to be able
to grow in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can transfer that plant so
it's no longer exposed to those
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminants in that small space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the biggest challenge when a plant is
exposed to fungus or bacteria in tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: culture versus in the field is you're
competing for limited nutrients here
[SPEAKER_02]: versus a larger space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at its core, it's enabled labs around
the world, whether they're in Pakistan or
[SPEAKER_02]: Benin or South Africa or Chile,
to be able to operate at the same level as
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the highest tech labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a company called Viscon,
and I think they build out labs that are
[SPEAKER_02]: 10, 15, 20 million dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are state of the art, cream of the
crop, best you can get of everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: fully automated, beautiful labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have a lot of universities
and research centers and companies in
[SPEAKER_02]: developing countries that might not be
able to afford that, that likely can't
[SPEAKER_02]: afford that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where PPM can add a little bit
more support to their facility,
[SPEAKER_02]: to their protocols, and to their workflow
so that if their workers inevitably do
[SPEAKER_02]: make a mistake, it's not going to cost
them however much each test tube is worth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really what got us the foot in
the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so companies knew us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's our creation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was patented.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was a game changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a major game changer for tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the original claim was you could do
tissue culture without a laminar flow
[SPEAKER_02]: hood, and people went crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's... Yeah, no, that wasn't...
We posted that in a University of
[SPEAKER_02]: Minnesota listserv, I think in the 90s,
and people are irate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try being an outsider coming into the
industry and saying, actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: guys, you can do this differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while we've had some success with
that, I wouldn't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do recommend using a flow hood.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do recommend practicing aseptic
technique because all those skills that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to learn and you're going to
practice, it's the right way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can shoot a basketball different ways,
but learning the right shot, I'd say,
[SPEAKER_02]: is recommended for most players.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd say the same goes for tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But PPM is that revolutionary product that
put our foot in the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you, over the last five,
six years, if it weren't for a lot of our
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing and sales efforts, it's been
hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of our competitors are signing
non-exclusive contracts with distributors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can only distribute products that
our competitors don't carry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it reinforces us outside of our box to
develop new products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So PPM was the first.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have two patent-pending products now.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is called the BioCoupler and the
BioKill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell me a little bit about the
BioCoupler?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think since the 70s or 80s,
there's been research in the plant tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: culture and agricultural technology space
about temporary immersion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And temporary immersion is essentially in
traditional semi-solid media.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have one contact point where the root
of the plant or the base of the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: contacts the media, and that's where it
absorbs nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: With temporary immersion, you're actually
soaking the whole plant in nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: temporarily, and then you're letting it
dry out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that mechanism and that 360 contact
point with the plant not only increases
[SPEAKER_02]: the speed at which that plant grows,
but increases the actual quantity of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that you're getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this technology has been revolutionary
for almost 50, 60 years, but the systems
[SPEAKER_02]: and contraptions and pipes and tubes for
temporary immersion bioreactors are just
[SPEAKER_02]: not feasible.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at temporary immersion
bioreactors today, a lot of them have two,
[SPEAKER_02]: three, four filters per bioreactor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have these long air tubes that
connect to those filters and then connect
[SPEAKER_02]: to oxygen tanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those tubes are bound to get contaminated,
clogged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those filters, you need to replace them
maybe every six to 12 months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those filters aren't cheap, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the risk of losing maybe five liters
worth of plants is high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while the technology has been there,
there hasn't been an application that's
[SPEAKER_02]: been feasible for the commercialization of
it at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are companies that use temporary
immersion bioreactors.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a few out there that are very
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're amazing at what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pumping in air works very well,
but not necessarily as commercially
[SPEAKER_02]: feasible in the long run.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did is, you know, at its
simplest, it's keep it simple,
[SPEAKER_02]: stupid, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The most complex systems sometimes are the
simplest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the biocoupler connects two glass
devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time you rotate that device,
there's an air exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of using a tube and instead of
pumping in oxygen, the plants that every
[SPEAKER_02]: time the biocoupler rotates, oxygen is
pumped through the little air patch filter
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the process is quite simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you screw up the bottom,
you screw a new media.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you have to do is change out the
media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, I mean, it'll take you less than
30 seconds versus the old bioreactors
[SPEAKER_02]: might take you an hour, 20 minutes,
30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we've done is we've simplified the
bioreactor model by creating a more
[SPEAKER_02]: commercially viable option.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's incredible what it can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants like orchids, we're seeing 30,
40, 50 times multiplication rates versus
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional semi-solid media.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting three or four, three or
four plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're getting 40, we're getting
50.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see this application being useful for
all types of crops, bananas, pineapples,
[SPEAKER_02]: orchids, cannabis, you name it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we've done, the biocoupler is
the base device.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biotilt is our automated machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of you flipping the device
every single day, we have a device that
[SPEAKER_02]: does that automatically.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can program it, you can set your own
timing on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want to flip it once every
three hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to flip it for, I want it to soak
for two minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want it to soak for three minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've really created a tool that people
can master and create their own research
[SPEAKER_02]: with by making slight modifications to the
programming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that enables people to, with any
species, add accessibility to a technology
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to be a game changer that
eventually will disrupt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think maybe replace the tissue
culture space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is hopefully the, you know,
1.0, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the biotilt 1.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to keep developing it,
keep improving it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the hope is that this will help
growers mass produce plants that are clean
[SPEAKER_02]: more consistently and at a cheaper price
than if they were using tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause at the end of the day, the gelling
agent that you're buying might cost you 90
[SPEAKER_02]: to a hundred dollars a kilogram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Temporary immersion, you don't even need
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just cut that from your budget
altogether.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been, and the funny part is it's
not new, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't invent, we didn't invent the
wheel here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just made a better wheel that fits the
car.
[SPEAKER_02]: More efficient wheel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't break down as easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rubber treads last longer,
easier to change the tires, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to make tissue culture more
accessible to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's through education, but also
through R&D.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you, it's, you know,
developing this stuff is not cheap and it
[SPEAKER_02]: takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're, we're doing our best and we are
a fairly small company.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think a lot of people look at our
website or look at our history and they
[SPEAKER_02]: think we're this huge corporation,
but we're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're, I think four or five full-time
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we have a lot of contractors and
we do contract manufacturing, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's family business.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were, we're expanding very fast and you
know, anybody who was listening that made
[SPEAKER_02]: an order and that's still waiting on it,
you know, thank you for your patience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Black Friday was kind of insane
for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're, we're so grateful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look, these are all blessings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to be able to keep up with the
demand and I just want people to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to know that we're here for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's, it's a daunting industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, you, you look on Google or
Wikipedia and you just, there's all these
[SPEAKER_02]: journals and papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're not from that world,
it's intimidating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully we can be that bridge for,
for the growers and especially in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis space, like we're here to help,
you know, we're here to answer your
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want you to use this tool because
Hopslate and Viroid, Fusarium,
[SPEAKER_02]: spider mites, powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these are big problems and they're
costing growers money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think I like to acquaint,
maybe, maybe this is controversial,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I like to call Hopslate and Viroid the
aids of, yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people don't realize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, unless you're heavily into genetics
collecting and like, we have ears all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world and now we're hearing about labs
in Spain going down, like that have the
[SPEAKER_01]: major collections that have been in
Amsterdam, stuff that haven't made it over
[SPEAKER_01]: a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody has it or, you know,
70, 80% of growers have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the good news to that problem is
there is a cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is, there is a protocol and a,
a mechanism of remediating those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where we come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where plant tissue culture thrives.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, for surface pathogens,
when you're talking about some of your,
[SPEAKER_02]: your common pests, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Your powdery mildew, your spider mites,
those are more easily curable with surface
[SPEAKER_02]: sterilization and nodal culture,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're, we're taking parts of the plant
that might not yet be infected,
[SPEAKER_02]: or if they are infected, they're,
they're less, there's a lower bug count
[SPEAKER_02]: than other parts of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're, you know, surface sterilizing that
leaf and then we're inducing it in media.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then keeping it in this clean
container away from your mother room,
[SPEAKER_02]: away from potential contaminants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if your HVAC technician comes in the
room, he's not going to be able to infect
[SPEAKER_02]: this little guy because it's sealed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As opposed to your mother room,
good luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if, if he brings in something
from another facility or if you forget to
[SPEAKER_02]: clean your, your shears, or if somebody
brings in cuttings and they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: quarantine it adequately, it will spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to facarium and you know,
cops late in biroid, the worst of them
[SPEAKER_02]: all.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where we really focus on the apical
meristem dissection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're doing, we have tons of
videos on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're, if your users are interested is
we're isolating the apical meristem,
[SPEAKER_02]: which if you think about it as the
primordial tissue not connected to the
[SPEAKER_02]: rest of the plant with scientific terms,
it's disconnected from the vasculature of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that cell cluster is not yet exposed to
whatever viroid or virus or fungus has
[SPEAKER_02]: infected the rest of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're literally going down to
millis millimeters going very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very small.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, you won't be able to see it
with the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use a hypodermic needle to isolate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we put it in this grow medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, in three months,
it'll grow, you know, grow up to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: normal plant, but it's small, it's tiny,
but that's the mechanism, at least our
[SPEAKER_02]: best plan at action, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, if a plant is highly infected,
you might have to do it a couple of times,
[SPEAKER_02]: which means you take them there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take a meristem, you let it grow
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you take a meristem again,
you let it grow out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really depends on the viral load.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now that is our best mechanism.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is our best tool that we can use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not using pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not using herbicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not soaking it in anything that's
going to, you know, affect the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: outcome of the plant down the line when
it's eventually consumed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but this mechanism is highly,
highly beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I'd say it's, it's probably the
hardest skill to learn in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so luckily nodal culture is fairly
basic and something most people can learn,
[SPEAKER_02]: but Meristem takes a little bit of
practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I can tell you is a hundred
dollar microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hypodermic needle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy it on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, you can really practice and
get better at the skill, or you just have
[SPEAKER_02]: one guy, you know, Joey is the guy and he
can do 20 and 30 an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but what we tell growers, especially
when it comes to viroids and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: who Sarian specifically is take as many
Meristems as you can, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you don't, you don't want to use
your Meristem.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we like to be preventative instead of
reactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the proactive measure is,
you know, keeping your spaces clean,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, bleaching the floors, you know,
following proper, proper, uh, sterile
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions and keeping your overall
facility clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody does that, but Meristem ing
and learning that skill is I'd say the
[SPEAKER_02]: last resort.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the first resort is using tissue
culture, using nodal culture, testing your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, keeping them backed up that
inevitably if and when something does get
[SPEAKER_02]: infected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have 10 of these or 50 of these,
so I can time it out in two to three
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be in the bedroom and ready to go,
but you have backups and we have the
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanism to back up our genetics now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we shouldn't be hearing about cannabis
strains going extinct.
[SPEAKER_02]: We shouldn't be here about, you know,
oh, I can't, I can't get guava tarts
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore because it's all, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every grower lets had a healthy cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately we're having guava tarts till
we can't stop vomiting.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just hypothetical there is saying,
you know, God forbid, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: God forbid, especially with some of the
more medicinal strains, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The lower THC, but more unique cannabinoid
profiles that actually really help people
[SPEAKER_02]: that are, you know, dealing with a wide
variety of health issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: God forbid one of those strains goes
extinct because a pesky viroid wiped it
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'd like to tell growers and tell
you specifically is please, please,
[SPEAKER_02]: please, even if you're not going to invest
in a lab, open your mind to tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: culture, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a tool that you will be using in
the next five to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not an if, it's a when.
[SPEAKER_02]: And start practicing because your genetics
are your business, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're an operator that owns
properties, you have property insurance,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have flood insurance, you likely have
fire insurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you live in California, those cannabis
grower, you should have insurance for the
[SPEAKER_02]: number one product that you're selling,
which is your plot, which is your flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what tissue culture does is
we're backing up your genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're protecting those genetics and we're
keeping them contained so that when you
[SPEAKER_02]: need them, when, when the disaster
strikes, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 50 backups ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then secondly, I'd say the main
benefit of tissue culture for growers that
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't as familiar is what if you could
shrink your mother room by three fourths?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the whole concept of the mother
room is going to become extinct.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea of keeping these huge trees alive
attracts pests, subtracts bugs,
[SPEAKER_02]: takes up energy, takes up space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now imagine if, you know, your mother room
was a hundred square feet instead of 1200.
[SPEAKER_02]: And imagine if you could have two more
bedrooms in there or you could dedicate
[SPEAKER_02]: that space for a lab, a mother room and
something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So growers obviously dealing with a wide
variety of issues, whether it's high
[SPEAKER_02]: taxation, whether it's, you know,
high cap X labor costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is another mechanism where tissue
culture can be a tool to actually reduce
[SPEAKER_02]: and lower your costs in the long run by
better optimizing the way that you grow
[SPEAKER_02]: and optimizing the way that you use your
space to effectively produce plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, that's, I, I, I could talk
about TC and its applications and its,
[SPEAKER_02]: its use cases all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's, it's paramount.
[SPEAKER_02]: For tissue for cannabis to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and yeah, man, we're, we're just
excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, this meeting is going to be launched
soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we have all these new products that
growers can use and experiment with
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically with, uh, the hemp cannabis
space and, um, our classes, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we have classes online.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have classes in person.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have pre-recorded classes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's, there's a million resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want to hear somebody say
there's, there's not enough information
[SPEAKER_02]: out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 800 videos for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: On YouTube on how to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and that's just scratching the
surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, our, our dedication to the
community is that we, we want this,
[SPEAKER_02]: this skill, this, this scientific practice
to thrive in the cannabis space,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, this is just one way that we can
do it more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I'm preaching the gospel.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, a lot of the moms in,
um, the cannabis space are kept in,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I'd say traditionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: The traditional market is as opposed to
the legal market, um, or commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: market, I guess the commercial market is,
would be the legal market now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're kept in more shoddy,
like homes and stuff, like a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: really old, rare stuff by people who don't
trust anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really nice to see, you know,
you guys coming out, putting all this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff out there, uh, showing how it can be
used.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it'll be interesting to see
that, that, that space adapt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start installing laminar flow hoods in,
in houses that are blowing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's awesome, but it's,
it's going to be the turning point because
[SPEAKER_01]: the commercial market doesn't have access
to most of what needs to be saved in the
[SPEAKER_01]: first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second inning, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second inning.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's so exciting about this is
we, we haven't even scratched the surface
[SPEAKER_02]: of what we can do with this technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, soon we already have the,
the technology to extract secondary
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So imagine growing THC or CBD or terpenes
just on, in gel without the actual plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Extracting, extracting those chemicals
directly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to continue to develop more
efficient mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not to say we're going to make
growing flower obsolete and growing plants
[SPEAKER_02]: obsolete.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as the industry develops and as
hopefully research opens up on the
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal side, we'll be able to better
identify an abinoid profiles and terpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: that actually help people and then grow
those specific profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without, you know, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being able to reproduce something exactly
without worrying about the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that would be a massive step in
reproduction and medicinal qualities of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're taking an Advil, if I'm,
if I'm taking, you know, Advil,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want 10 milligrams every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want 10 and 9.7 and 8.9.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a medicine at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just guessing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this, this tissue culture specifically
is, is one of the, I'd say most important
[SPEAKER_02]: steps that will marry the industry as it
transitions from, you know, black market,
[SPEAKER_02]: gray market to fully white market,
corporatized, commercialized at a large
[SPEAKER_02]: scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, you know, you're seeing your
largest producers, your segras,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have conception and node labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you have a lot of companies in the
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, and we were talking about this a
little earlier backstage, but there are
[SPEAKER_02]: also a lot of people that love the word
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they use that buzzword to claim what
they're doing is tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: When in reality, it might not be tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be something else that they're
calling tissue culture, or they might just
[SPEAKER_02]: be doing tissue culture incorrectly and
charging somebody an arm and a leg for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I tell people is be wary,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do your due diligence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who are these companies that are popping
out of nowhere that are claiming to have
[SPEAKER_02]: the protocols and the knowledge and the
skills to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very likely that they do have them,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, any industry that
starts to blow up or starts to get popular
[SPEAKER_02]: attracts people that like to take
advantage of others, especially one with
[SPEAKER_01]: the gray market where that you can't get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you don't have to work with
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want you to, you know, your hard
earned money should go to somebody that
[SPEAKER_02]: can actually help you and not somebody
that's going to use a buzzword claim to
[SPEAKER_02]: claim to do it, charge you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, you're left with a
plant that's still infected dead or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, or worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seed companies are the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same cesspool of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's breeders and then there's seed
makers in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people that breed and there's
people that can make seeds, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone that has a male and a female and
trying to, for people coming in,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to guess who is who is the worst
game ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like marketing doesn't quite relay who
is what and does what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tissue culture for me, for me going from
seed to tissue culture and trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: navigate that sphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a completely still like foreign
sphere to me, even though I should be
[SPEAKER_01]: massively invested in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been so tenuous and yeah,
we will send you some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't, you don't need a 500 square
foot lab to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a laminar flow hood because every
time I've tried it, I've massively failed
[SPEAKER_01]: massively, but it's, it's been because of
small little, you know, infectious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's infectious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then hopefully depending on how good
the instructions were in that video,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can start practicing on some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I, I'd recommend some seeds that
aren't valuable to you first, just the
[SPEAKER_02]: protocol, but you know, getting the,
getting the skills of grabbing the
[SPEAKER_02]: scalpel, putting the seed in without
touching the surfaces, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: being careful with your hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's the first step, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And imagine just.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fino hunting in this way, you can just put
them on a shelf and you can have,
you know, you can have, you know,
you can have, you know, you can have,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, have 10,000 of these little guys
that take up, you know, maybe a library
[SPEAKER_02]: shelf instead of a whole farm,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Your, your, your space efficiency is
increased by a magnitude of 10 to 15
[SPEAKER_02]: times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you can really store them,
keep them safe and secure in these test
[SPEAKER_02]: tubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, you know, there is,
there is some maintenance with this,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not just going to put this at a
test tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll eventually outgrow the test tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that, that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll grow fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a, there is a maintenance,
a maintenance involved with this and
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's every two to three,
four weeks, you're going to change that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant to new media.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that plant itself can survive in that
media for, you know, extensively forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: No scientific report will ever say
forever, a hundred percent with anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a long time of probably outlive you
and me.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, we're, I like to think of
ourselves as conservationists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're, we're caretakers for these plants,
for these genetics that hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: generations will experience, will consume,
will, will get to take care of or,
[SPEAKER_02]: or be exposed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I mean, it all comes back to
tissue culture as necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've said it a million times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel bad, but you guys are just,
you need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like one of the few things that
I've seen, and I'd like to ask you how you
[SPEAKER_01]: would mitigate something like this early
on when you culture became like,
[SPEAKER_01]: a buzzword, uh, maybe 10 years ago,
like in cannabis, when people really
[SPEAKER_01]: started pushing it hard, they were,
um, selling whole nurseries were selling
[SPEAKER_01]: like tissue culture and saying like,
yes, we'll, we'll, we'll give you a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can run them right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'd run them and everything
would have intersex issues right away or,
[SPEAKER_01]: or some kind of hormonal issues coming out
of just tissue culture, running the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's straight in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, how do you mitigate stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you mitigate that from happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first and foremost, testing,
right at its, at its finest, we're using
[SPEAKER_02]: the same testing devices that they use to
test for COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we're using to test for Hopsley and
by right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thermo cyclers, PCR machines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, fortunately, as the need for these
devices has increased, the price has gone
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So supply demand, you know, it might call,
it might've cost you 10, $15,000 to get
[SPEAKER_02]: access to a, a product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Proper PCR machine that could run for
Hopsley and by right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, now you might be able to get one
for cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not 15,000, maybe five, six,
7,000, but I think when tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: first started becoming a buzzword,
people, well, I can't speak for everyone,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a small percentage of that industry
use that buzzword to sell and make quick
[SPEAKER_02]: money.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we know, this industry is actually a
lot smaller than people give it credit
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, your reputation is
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, hurting people and taking
advantage of them is, is a easy way to go
[SPEAKER_02]: bankrupt quick as a business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so testing products, I would say is,
is the easiest way to avoid any of these
[SPEAKER_02]: issues, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do gender screening and gender
testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, many PCR is a great company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think their device is like $1,500.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only six wells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll take you a little while,
but you can, you can run gender screening
[SPEAKER_02]: on that device.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, for hops late and viroid, there's some
great companies to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genomics has a, uh, they're great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me as a great device.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can test for hops late and viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say the only challenge with the device
as of now is it doesn't tell you viral
[SPEAKER_02]: load.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll just tell you positive or negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can be, especially if you're,
you're trying to determine how bad the
[SPEAKER_02]: plan is affected.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many, how many remediation cycles do
we need to go through?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good thing to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, to me also has a lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can send them plants directly and they
can run tests in lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: AgD is another great one.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have their device.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I don't think it also tells viral
load, but it will tell you a positive or
[SPEAKER_02]: negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to confirm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't hold me to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, sorry, AgD, if I got that wrong,
uh, but they're great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they lent us a device that we
were using for our master classes for a
[SPEAKER_02]: good year, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that thing was probably $10,
$12,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ran, we ran a number of hops late and
viroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, none of the cuttings and
plants we brought in had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, fortunately or unfortunately,
cause I think it's also good to experiment
[SPEAKER_02]: with it, but we also just obsolete and
viroid is a viroid that can transfer not
[SPEAKER_02]: only from cannabis to other crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we gotta be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, especially in our lab, but yeah,
we, we luckily didn't bring anything home.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the simple answer to your question is
making sure you're checking all the boxes,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they doing noto culture?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they rooting in vitro or ex vitro?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the test tube or out of the test
tube, what's what stages are they running
[SPEAKER_02]: through in tissue culture versus out of
tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they actually running testing or are
they just taking plants, putting in tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: culture and hoping for the best?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people are doing the
latter because that's cost money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's like $40, $50 in the test.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, as a commercial business,
if that is your, if, if that's your
[SPEAKER_02]: business, if that's your welfare,
I highly recommend investing in those
[SPEAKER_02]: tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend allocating part of your budget
towards the due diligence required to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: your actual product clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, that's the missing link.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the testing companies combining with
the tissue culture knowledge gives us that
[SPEAKER_02]: full 360 perspective of are my plants male
or female?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the terpene profiles,
THC profiles, everything else when it
[SPEAKER_02]: comes to testing for heavy metals,
testing for preservatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also does this plant have hops?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this plant have the serum?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this plant have any of the other
pathogens, viroids and viruses that plague
[SPEAKER_02]: this industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have the knowledge, we have the
machinery and the skills to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just about, I guess, helping people
and teaching them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in our class, we, we do spend at least
half a day to a day on testing because
[SPEAKER_02]: testing is not easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: As simple as, you know, putting a plant in
a test tube and, you know, there,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are steps and it's, it's kind of
like cooking, but I'd say it's more like
[SPEAKER_02]: baking where you got to use the exact
amount of flour and you got to use the
[SPEAKER_02]: exact amount of eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise it's going to overcook or
undercooked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thing goes with using a QPCR machine,
using a thermocycler, using some of those
[SPEAKER_02]: devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but with anything practice makes
perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the education, the opportunity to
learn it's all there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I think as a grower, as a breeder,
as somebody that's working in the
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial side of the space, you have to
make that decision, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: From a budget standpoint, does it make
more sense to do this in house?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it make more sense to send it out and
send it out to labs that do testing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that really comes down to your budget,
your patients, your, uh, commitment to
[SPEAKER_02]: investing in the equipment and the
protocols and the people, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The labor to be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's just a whole nother
component, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody you hire in the, in the facility
likely already has a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who, who's going to take over,
uh, for who's going to do testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's a, that's a question
that really comes down to your business
[SPEAKER_02]: plan, your needs and your budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so something I do recommend growers
take seriously and consider, but,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, still it's, it's very important
because again, tissue culture needs to be
[SPEAKER_02]: coupled with the testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise you're really kind of shooting
in the dark here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's that way with breeding even.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you don't, if you don't eventually
test in some way, have someone even if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's down to having someone smoke it and
having a group of people smoking it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not getting any kind of feedback
and it's all shooting in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you're just losing time, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're doing real breeding,
it's time and time is money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time is money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time is money and it's all we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you don't get back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can cut that cycle in half,
right, you don't have to grow it out to a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain point where you already know what
the problem is and you can mitigate that
[SPEAKER_02]: problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: That saves you money, a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, especially in the long run.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people are thinking very short
term when it comes to these businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is incredibly competitive,
very cut throat, very hard to succeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people outside the industry think
it's like this, you know, everybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: making cash hand over hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: The margins are tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've spoken to hundreds of growers and I,
I empathize.
[SPEAKER_02]: With you guys, guys and girls,
it's hard and we know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're just trying to find ways
through the technology that we're applying
[SPEAKER_02]: to every other plant species alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we also use this or cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we also optimize this process and
give you more time back or give you more
[SPEAKER_02]: space back or save a little bit of room in
your budget for keeping your genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: alive for another couple of years or
forever, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, it's, it's, it is funny how it
really started with orchids though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it doesn't surprise me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I used to collect orchids quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like a $3 billion industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought they were beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and as I was learning, I was like,
well, you know, what's a Kiki,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then starting to learn how
people, how people, you know, you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: just pop seeds of orchids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it blew my mind that you just
couldn't go pop seeds of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't I just go get seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seeds are literally dust and you have
to spread them out and gel media for them
[SPEAKER_02]: to actually start to germinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, what's cool about the cannabis
space is I think because of the passion
[SPEAKER_02]: and love and variety that exists and just
biodiversity within the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_02]: itself, this is, I mean, this,
this could be one of the best mechanisms
[SPEAKER_02]: of getting people into genetics,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Human genetics can benefit from this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inevitably, if we train hundreds of
thousands of technicians that know how to
[SPEAKER_02]: isolate a Maristan, that know how to work
with cell culture, whether, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: working with certain hormones,
whether you're telling a plant to produce
[SPEAKER_02]: shoots or roots or callus, I mean,
all these skills will eventually be
[SPEAKER_02]: translated or translatable into animal
culture, into cell culture, into human
[SPEAKER_02]: cell culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we're just, we're just
scratching the surface with plants and the
[SPEAKER_02]: beauty is cannabis is a mechanism for this
industry to grow because people love that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant more than anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, orchids are probably the second
most popular, second or first most
[SPEAKER_02]: popular, you know, maybe irrational love,
uh, even though they're incredible plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love orchids, nothing against orchids,
but because of the biodiversity and the
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic, you know, the uniqueness of
genetics with cannabis, people are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be diving into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this industry and this,
this science is only going to grow from
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, it's similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to say it's how the adult
entertainment industry developed the
[SPEAKER_02]: internet, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It really started off with, you know,
webcam girls and chats and, and really raw
[SPEAKER_02]: footage, but that, you know, created this
explosion with programmers and people that
[SPEAKER_02]: were so interested in the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, sometimes the vices lead us
into, uh, the bigger picture, but,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, it's, there's a,
there's a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there's still a lot of applications
that we need to find out and growers need
[SPEAKER_02]: to take the time to figure out how it
works for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to tell you that tissue
culture can replace the way that you grow
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to replace the way you grow
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not trying to get rid of your,
um, I mean, we are trying to get rid of
[SPEAKER_02]: your mother room, but we're not,
we're not trying to get rid of everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're trying to do is say,
Hey, here's a new tool that you can use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been trying to use a screwdriver,
but it's not exact.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, you know, the grooms aren't
aligning quite right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this, this is a new tool that you can
add.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can help you with X, Y, Z.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and yeah, it's, it's all, it's all
part of the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is, is, is phenol hunting, like as a,
as somebody that's into seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding, is, is phenol hunting expensive?
[SPEAKER_01]: To do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do it correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you're talking about phenol
hunting, like, is it, are you going and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting something from another country?
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you trying to have it expressed
the same way it expresses in that country
[SPEAKER_01]: at that point?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's a crap shoot,
like trying to get it done and to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: very expensive, popping thousands,
trying to replicate the soil density,
[SPEAKER_01]: porosity, what's, what's, what's its
makeup is, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but when it comes down to like,
let's say I want to select blueberry from
[SPEAKER_01]: something, um, it's a lot easier because
there's so much work that's been laid out
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just having experience, know what
direction and why, but phenol hunting is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a breeder, um, seed make,
if you're just a seed maker, I'd say it's
[SPEAKER_01]: more of a marketing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Hey, you can get all these phenos
from this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: When ideally when you're breeding,
you don't want to have a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: expressions, a wide swath of expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would more likely want a minimal
amount of expressions so people can get a
[SPEAKER_01]: proven plant from a set of seeds,
ideally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and for, for you or for some growers,
obviously, you know, I'm sure the timeline
[SPEAKER_02]: varies, but what, what would you say is
the average time from a grower to a pheno
[SPEAKER_02]: hunt, find traits and expressions that
they like, and then actually produce that
[SPEAKER_02]: planted scale?
[SPEAKER_01]: Three years, I'd say it would be three
years, three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do it correctly, to pop seeds,
do proper pheno hunts, run it once,
[SPEAKER_01]: run it twice, run it three times to make
sure that it's going to be replicating the
[SPEAKER_01]: same expressions you saw the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, then if you want to take it and
breed it, I would say like you would
[SPEAKER_01]: feminize the seed to get to speed up the
process, self it and go from there,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe self it a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that case, it would be seven,
eight years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would hate to lose three to 10 years
worth of work because some, some
[SPEAKER_02]: technician brought in a bug and killed my
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just, it's insane to think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I mean, people that do spend the
time and have the skills to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can imagine you get tired after
you lose a certain amount of genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we need these guys to keep going,
guys and girls, you know, whoever,
[SPEAKER_02]: however they identify to keep going
because yeah, no, it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time intensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so use tissue cold group, please back
up your genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, please, you know, help us,
help us help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've lost whole collections at certain
points.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually like three years ago,
I was like, fuck this, no more mom room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing gave all of my moms to everyone
else and just started working on my stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that I'm getting back to,
cause I literally stuck my head in the
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry genetics and until I have was
producing a perfect blueberry smelling,
[SPEAKER_01]: tasting plants reliably and feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I've got, I'm like, Oh man,
I need to go get my mom's again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and now I'm like, man,
do I really want it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like 18 years of a mom room sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like running a big math.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we were, we were running between a
hundred and I don't know at some points,
[SPEAKER_01]: 180 moms to down to 30 to 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when people don't realize like that's
a lot of moms, you're constantly cycling
[SPEAKER_01]: clones cycling clones because we weren't
in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got seven or eight clones of one
thing just to hope you don't miss,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and, and there's only a few of
us still doing that in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not in major corporations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even interact with them because
they won't, you know, and, and what,
[SPEAKER_01]: what part of our job, like I feel like,
or, or what we're doing with the breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: syndic is trying to, trying to break the
mold between what's going on with the
[SPEAKER_01]: legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on with the traditional
market, which is where you're at and
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to people in academia and in
science and trying to link all those,
[SPEAKER_01]: because like a lot of people in academia
don't understand that there's only a few
[SPEAKER_01]: historians in cannabis that understand how
everything came to be and could put that
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's a really closed circuit of
people and everybody really deeply knows
[SPEAKER_01]: each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then getting those people to talk to
those people and linking it all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nobody ends up getting screwed by the
marketers in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I still got screwed going to
the tissue culture market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and I thought I thought I thought I
could be totally confident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know cannabis, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And still got worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's, it's slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, cannabis expresses
itself a little differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And tissue culture, you're, you're
inducing stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: This plant is under stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not its normal growth environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it will have interesting expressions,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you use too many hormones, it won't
grow well.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a right and wrong way of doing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with people, what I like to say is
just start basic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't, don't play around too much with
hormones and this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, just be simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try it at its simplest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, we do have like some base
protocols to use, but really start there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eventually you can run your R and
D and of course strains will respond
[SPEAKER_02]: differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the, that's the craziest part is
the genetic diversity will cause,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, whether it's due to the terpene
or the THC or the CBD or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a variety of other factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: One plant might not grow as well in the
same media as another plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is, this is why we're still very
much in that development phase in figuring
[SPEAKER_02]: out how growers can commercialize this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with our formula we've seen,
I mean, the formula works for,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, maybe 90, 95% of strains,
but there are some outliers, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's where continued R and D
comes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're never, we're never done
researching.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're never fully satisfied with our
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe PPM is the one product that we
really can't improve because it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it, it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with medias and protocol, there's
always going to be new things to improve
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I know we're, we're coming close on
the hour here, but one thing I wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: mention that we didn't talk about briefly
is synthetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you familiar with synthetic seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dutch Passion, one of the Dutch companies
15 years ago, did a small release of them
[SPEAKER_01]: and realized that most people didn't know
what to do with them once they got them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool to see it, but yeah,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first time I'd seen it
brought to the cannabis market on any
[SPEAKER_01]: scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was small, it was small scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the bio couple comes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we found that there's really two ways
of germinating synthetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is temporary immersion, which is very
effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second is actually breaking
that seed coat, like the little gel coat
[SPEAKER_02]: and placing that plant in media and rich
culture media.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the implications of this are huge
because not only are transporting plants
[SPEAKER_02]: problematic because they die or they get
contaminated, but now you can get,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can probably fit two, 300 little
plantlets.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call them synthetic seeds, but they're
actually just, they're, they're little
[SPEAKER_02]: nodes from the plant that will eventually
grow to be big.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can fit two, 300 in one test tube and
you can travel with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, cause they're not seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're encapsulated little tapioca balls
if, you know, if you look at it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but how does that work legally?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like since they aren't quite seeds and
they aren't quite, well, I plead the
[SPEAKER_01]: fifth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's one of those things where like,
I just don't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I won't speak on the legal
implication, not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I won't recommend one thing or
another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause again, not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just, we just, we just know the
technology and how it's used for different
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, different flowers, spicy tomatoes,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the biggest thing that your customs
officers are looking for is soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dirt brings bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dirt brings fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dirt brings contaminants that are foreign
to wherever you're going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the big problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the phytosanitary certificate,
this is certified sterile.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been fully sterilized.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this one isn't, but usually
wrapped, covered, sealed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is no risk of this specific test
tube infecting our, our food system or our
[SPEAKER_02]: animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this, this eliminates one of the
biggest risks within transporting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then secondly, just the mode of
transporting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's so much easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine if you're a grower, instead of
having to buy a truck and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: putting these mothers in a huge truck,
you can put little test tubes in a vial
[SPEAKER_02]: and send them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or drive them over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a game changer with how much
space you can, you can save and how much
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiency you can take advantage of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, yeah, it's just,
it's another toolkit that people can use
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're working on developing further.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first, how long can these synthetic
seeds survive?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're doing research on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second is what are the best mechanisms of
germinating the synthetic seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then third, what are the best formulas
for those synthetic seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: To keep them alive, to keep them
contamination free and to keep them
[SPEAKER_02]: sterile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of these points in research are in
progress, are being developed and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, stuff that we will share with
the community, of course, whether it's via
[SPEAKER_02]: products, via protocols, or just via
training in our, in our classes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want growers to use all these tools
accessible to them to improve their
[SPEAKER_02]: operations, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you save money here?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you save time here?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you create more space efficiency
here?
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, that's,
that's what this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, we're optimizing the way that
we grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's cannabis, whether it's
orchids, whether it's pineapples,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're all plants and they all require
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Light nutrients, water, oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, second inning,
man, still a ball game.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot to learn and a lot to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we haven't even scratched
the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point in your life did you get
into the cannabis sphere of this business?
[SPEAKER_01]: You said it was a family business,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say right around the time the
hemp bill was passed is when we started
[SPEAKER_02]: really trying to better understand the
cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like I said earlier, you know,
Bill Graham was probably the first and
[SPEAKER_02]: only public person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's amazing to really work with cannabis
and to publicize it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There were, you know, university of
Mississippi has been, I guess they had
[SPEAKER_02]: some, some.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: University of Guelph.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are these large
institutions, amazing institutions with
[SPEAKER_02]: unbelievable, you know, small Zaboya,
Dr. Zaboya and people who've been in this
[SPEAKER_02]: space who know the plant left and right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was really hidden for 15 years,
20 years, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think people really, we, we started
getting into it 27 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2017, 2018 and connecting within our
network of customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we, we do sell products,
you know, a lot of these universities,
[SPEAKER_02]: university of Guelph for these,
these large companies already use our
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: They already know us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just about, you know, sharing data
or sharing research.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to better understand what you're
working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it important?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the implications?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then going to conferences,
like we went to CanMed and I learned a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: about, you know, how to test for some of
these virus, viruses and viroids,
[SPEAKER_02]: how to, um, use testing technology to
better understand, uh, or to better
[SPEAKER_02]: integrate, uh, tissue culture and
commercial operations with testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are more and more resources now
than there ever were before.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I tell you as five, six years ago,
I guess, before we started on YouTube,
[SPEAKER_02]: you might've found somebody with an accent
on a whiteboard or a chalkboard drawing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, stage one tissue culture,
stage two tissue culture, writing out
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific terms, trying to explain it,
but.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I appreciate the effort,
but it didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started making videos so that I,
I myself could better understand the
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm a visual learner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to, um, as I'm reading,
see what they're actually doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so there are a few amazing books,
like one's called, uh, plants from test
[SPEAKER_02]: tubes and a few other authors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing book, very just.
[SPEAKER_02]: Insightful, easy way to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, cannabis camp,
cannabis camp cannabis had really,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think started seven, six, five,
six years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's really kind of grown to his
life, to a life of its own and really
[SPEAKER_02]: helping support us and the RD that we're
doing or answering questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we're getting questions
that we never thought of that we can now
[SPEAKER_02]: pursue because people want to figure out
how they can utilize this or, or how this
[SPEAKER_02]: can be efficient for the way that they
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's really.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gift that keeps on giving,
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growers have nonstop questions,
unlimited curiosity and desire to see
[SPEAKER_02]: their plants healthy desire to see their
plants grow and thrive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, we're learning as much as they are
along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're and all that information or a lot of
that information is public.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I should take you to one of our parties
where a bunch of these old old reclusive
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders go and meet up and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can talk to the, to the guys that were
involved in doing this from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'd love to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we went to MJ last year and MJ
this con and we set up a flow hood,
[SPEAKER_02]: just in the middle of a party.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there was so much smoke you could
barely see, but we showed people what we
[SPEAKER_02]: were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, you know, big buzzword that,
you know, you thought would cost you
[SPEAKER_02]: $50,000 or $2 million.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's just a flow hood, some equipment
and approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And showing people, getting them under the
hood, giving them the tools, like once
[SPEAKER_02]: they really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simplify it and, you know, see it for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as scary as, as it sounds,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, it is something to learn,
but it's not as complicated as,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, requiring a PhD for the very basics,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously you want to run research.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to run the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have the education and we,
we recommend that, but again, if you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to, if you work in that lab, if you want
to have the skills to work under somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: that has the knowledge they can share with
you, you know, we can teach you and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's resources online to, to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were classes are, are a decent
price too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're, they're not super expensive
or unaffordable at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was really awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's all hundred dollar pack of
seeds though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so like, you know, $400 on a,
on a basic, you know, entrance thing isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that's two packs of seeds for most
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, you can spend four or $500 every
couple of months or a couple of years on
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds or spend your time and money on Fino
hunting or spend the time and effort of
[SPEAKER_02]: cleaning up a problem, or you can invest
in the knowledge and let that knowledge
[SPEAKER_03]: pay for itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Knowledge is the most valuable thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially with tissue culture
knowledge, the companies that employ it
[SPEAKER_02]: have a cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they have the first movers advantage
because they're optimizing the way they
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is enabling them to invest more in
better equipment, better processes,
[SPEAKER_02]: better products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So use it as an advantage, take advantage
of the fact that the information is out
[SPEAKER_02]: there now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no excuse, whether it's our
classes, videos online, tons of education,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's blogs, there's, there's an
unlimited wealth of resources and start
[SPEAKER_02]: looking, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Start reading, start asking questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can reach out to us, come to one of
our classes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we'll do some more shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the next couple months or years,
we're not going to MJBizCon this year,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'd say we'll probably end up at
Spanibus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Spanibus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Europeans loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like a blast out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we set up the flow hood.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were doing synthetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were doing demos.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were doing it themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People ate it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also go to orchid shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go to flower shows where we're involved
in, you know, other industries as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, don't be shy to reach out and if
we can help you, we're here to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what's funny is like most of our
audience probably would never go to
[SPEAKER_01]: MJBizCon or, or, I mean, cause the,
the, the corporate market kind of shook
[SPEAKER_01]: out all of the traditional market already.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've already run through the guys and
used them, got the, whatever they needed,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it was, you know, learning how to
do this and that, or using them for their
[SPEAKER_01]: connections or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most people don't even go to that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to all go to the Emerald Cup
feature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard a lot about the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be the Wild West where like,
you know, like we'd go and make a year's
[SPEAKER_01]: worth of sales in a night or a weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually they're like,
all of you need licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of us were like, ah crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then there was like one seed bank
there that was borrowing someone's license
[SPEAKER_01]: that sold one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, it was just like,
it's a shame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's not, there's nothing else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a realistic thing that's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You always knew it was going to happen,
but watching, watching how it's changed
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and who the big players are and the
passion that they didn't come with for the
[SPEAKER_01]: most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm sure there are is one or two,
but like, I don't know, like not without
[SPEAKER_01]: naming anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of major, the major cannabis
corporations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, just been one major
pushback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're killing all of the genetics
and everyone's passion for breeding by
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly letting the market force
cookies down our throat under a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: different names.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what, that's kind of where I'm
at with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I see anything, brunch,
gelato, cookies, sherb, it's all like the
[SPEAKER_01]: same expressions of everything melded with
different names.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of where breeding's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, a lot of our mission has been to
get people interested in other stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't talked about by rappers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Per se, you know, or like, yeah,
but it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's hard because we don't
have the, the marketing expense that like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, give this rapper $75,000 to rap about
this, this strain, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the real way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's, it's, it's marrying a lot
of different worlds that probably never
[SPEAKER_01]: would have originally met and nobody
expected to meet, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what I'd say to that too,
though, is what sets you apart from those
[SPEAKER_02]: big commercial grows?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's your genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have, you have Budweiser, but you
still have microbreweries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microbreweries of anything have continued
to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think eventually, maybe not,
but my hunch is that you'll have these big
[SPEAKER_02]: growers that sell kind of dirt weed and,
you know, low quality product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'll have, you know,
very niche and unique strains that can
[SPEAKER_02]: only be obtained from some of the best
breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to those breeders and to the world that
is getting pushed out via
[SPEAKER_02]: commercialization, those genetics that's,
that's your, that's your ticket and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, your library, your, your passion
for finding the, you know, unique
[SPEAKER_02]: expressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's how you can differentiate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause a lot of these guys that are
entering the space that are large
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial, they're buying out,
they don't, they don't know what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a quick turnover for money,
usually in most of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get in, get out, make money,
get out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So protect your genetics is, is the,
is the moral of the story is the moral of
[SPEAKER_02]: the interviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, please, please make sure your
genetics stay alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you spent time, you spent money,
you spent years or months, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: investing in, in identifying them and
growing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep them safe and use tissue culture
to keep them safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, after this interview,
um, heirs, I'm sure I'm going to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot more questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some here, but they would,
they would run us into like two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I'll probably bother you again for
some work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can run through this and like,
yeah, cause there's questions about
[SPEAKER_01]: Ploydy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all this other stuff that people want
to know using tissue and assessing it.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, this has been an absolute
pleasure and, and it's, it's data heavy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what, that's what people need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll be able to watch this over and
over and over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and we're just going to continue the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So questions are, are encouraged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, as I said, there's plenty of resources
to like, if you have basic questions or
[SPEAKER_02]: more advanced questions, we either have it
already answered.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just literally search on our blog
for it, or, um, we can touch base and I
[SPEAKER_02]: can, you know, I can share some answers as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, please, you know, we're,
that's, we're here for, we're happy to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to appreciate it and say,
I appreciate you guys for, for making
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself so available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we had to reschedule this like two or
three times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was busy knocking myself out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate it and I'm glad we got to
turn it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you asked some great questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I love that you came to one of our
webinars and here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the beauty of this community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, hopefully we can just keep it
going and teach, teach and share this
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge with as many people as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the type of person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I go and I see someone like
someone doing a webinar on embryonic
[SPEAKER_01]: rescue, I know enough that I'm going to be
like, are they doing it right or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll say exactly like,
stop it bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and there's no bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just, it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: No bullshit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, this will probably air Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and I'll let you know when
and where.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be continued.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, looking forward to talking to you
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Yoni.
