[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_00]: clan-destined scene through the eyes of
the folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-So-Dog, Breeder and Grower from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
where we cover strain history.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest today is the Rev from Kingdom of
Organic Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice to see you.
Hey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't talked, so we're going to catch
up a lot on everything you've been doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that you've done for the people
who are new to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where we're going from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start off, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what started the Rev on his cannabis
adventure?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess I was about, this has been
about 1975, I guess, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I planted my first weed ever, and my mom
ended up killing it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: As they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: She ratted me out, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was so pissed that my beautiful
plants got killed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had about a half a pound baggie,
about a quarter full of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went out in the backyard the next
day, and I just spread them everywhere,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So a Dichondra lawn of cannabis came up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_05]: My parents freaked out, and we eventually
struck a deal where I could grow four
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: They gave in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I just overrode them, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was jazzed about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I grew up my mom's backyard for a
couple of years after that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, you know, I was an idiot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know what I was doing,
but I grew some giant frickin' plants,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, my dad, he was a
hydroponic experiment scientist guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He loved hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: One was on the other end of the scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was fully organic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, as organic as you could
be back in 1970s.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they each had their own input to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I learned hydroponics really well,
really fast, the whole dynamic of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my mom taught me organics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first thing I did, of course,
was I flopped into hydroponics and,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, started building systems and
designing them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that worked out really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I look back now at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, man, we really sure thought
we had some great buds back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I won't even touch a synthetic grown
bud these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, do you remember those old catalogs
from Sensi Seeds, like the pictures,
[SPEAKER_02]: the buds back then just all chewed up and
rotten?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a different time, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I hope you know, because of my
hydroponics, I had met these guys in
[SPEAKER_05]: Northern California and they were super
interested in hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't know anything about
hydroponics and they wanted to know big
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was kind of a marriage made in
heaven right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got together with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They agreed to teach me their ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were breeders and growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I would teach them hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, that could have worked out
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apprenticeship made in heaven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what kind of stuff were you seeing
around then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it mostly organic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it mostly Mexican stuff that was
coming in import?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys had connection with the
surfers, right, around the world,
[SPEAKER_05]: like several pro surfers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were hooked up with some really
prime genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why when people nowadays tell me,
you know, oh, the weed now is so much more
[SPEAKER_05]: strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, as a whole, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But not if you're a selector and you find
a clone of something like Blue Mountain
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamaican or something from Hawaii,
something picked and selected.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: We tie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I always hear these stories about the
old ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I've always kind of chased
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked up to you when I was,
you know, getting into breeding and
[SPEAKER_02]: growing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, wow, this dude's super
into tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see what this is about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a special region that produce just I
don't know if it was the region that
[SPEAKER_02]: produced the incredibly special plants or
the farmers were just better at it or how
[SPEAKER_02]: it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plants from different regions are kind of
similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's like Central Americans are
kind of close to Southeast Asians.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they have a lot in common.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like Colombians and South Americans
or have some similarities with South
[SPEAKER_05]: Africans and Africans like the Rui Bart,
right, from South Africa and like a
[SPEAKER_05]: Colombian red, a good, a good,
strong, real Colombian red.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be tough to tell them apart by
high tide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've always tripped out about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I thought, well, there must have
been some boats going around exchanging
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics way back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wonder about like maybe they were
just, you know, similar equator,
[SPEAKER_02]: similar elephant shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the genes are similar,
too, because, I mean, you can grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can have something like a Durban
poison from South Africa that is miles
[SPEAKER_05]: different than a Rui Bart or a Colombian.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but but there are there are
strange similarities across the table that
[SPEAKER_05]: always make me wonder what happened in the
past, how they got there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No kidding, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some pretty weird ones like
there's a lot of that turpentine in a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of Colombians, but in a lot of Mexicans,
there's skunkiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you think there would have been a lot
of trade going up and down through there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they did keep their own little
separate divisions, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're, you know, they're they're
those like the Mexicans, especially
[SPEAKER_05]: they're they're like the South Africans,
too, in a way, is that at first,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, when people are looking for all
the turpentine, looking for the smells and
[SPEAKER_05]: the flavors, they're always like,
oh, this smells like lemon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's super common at the early
stages of flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of sativas to smell that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't really start to put their real
smelly legs on until at least halfway
[SPEAKER_05]: through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what were some of the first lines that
you were making crosses of?
[SPEAKER_02]: What were some of the first crosses even
before breeding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just your first like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: God, you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: The first ones I find it hard to remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember I had a I remember I had a
tackle box.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cops got that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had I had a tackle box just full of a
big one label just full of all kinds of I
[SPEAKER_05]: wish I could remember some of them now,
but damn, I just I just can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mostly regional varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them are reasonable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them I got from France.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them I got, you know, online
having to read the catalog and mail and
[SPEAKER_05]: go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: When was it that when Seabay came online
around that time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So early 2000s, late 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When they came online, I started really
digging on the availability of online
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, you know, you run the risk
of crap, but oh, yeah, I found some real
[SPEAKER_05]: gems back then just popping around talking
to people.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was crap, too, but still.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, is that is that the era that you
got the metal haze?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was from Dutch Flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, you know, you and I were
talking about the having to select things
[SPEAKER_05]: Southeast Asians like hazes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that that metal haze, it was funny
because if I recall, I got I think I got
[SPEAKER_05]: six or eight females out of a 10 pack and
pretty much most of them were average and
[SPEAKER_05]: okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of them were better than okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that one, they're like,
oh, my God, you know, it stood out like a
[SPEAKER_05]: beacon.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was lucky, really.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was lucky because really,
you usually have to go through a lot more
[SPEAKER_05]: than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially in haze varieties because it's
just so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any sativa that has like mostly a land
race history is going to be a real good
[SPEAKER_05]: selection because wild plants keep their
options open.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they sure do.
[SPEAKER_05]: They keep a big genotype on reserve to
tap.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they don't really unless they're super,
super old, like like the deep chunk or
[SPEAKER_05]: Panama Red or Thai, some things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just they're set in their ways
just like old people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They aren't changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep chunks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're just they're real.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're real acclimated to whatever
environment they were inbred 500 times
[SPEAKER_05]: into or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep chunk just loves the Mendo and that's
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like the Mendo Outdoor is
perfect for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: People have big problems with it when
their pH usually runs low.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, yeah, because, you know,
it won't tolerate a normal pH.
[SPEAKER_05]: If your pH runs six, eight, six,
seven, you're going to have small issues
[SPEAKER_05]: with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your pH has to be up around seven for it
to really kick ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even know that part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had trouble with it on and off in the
past.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess it's because it's from the
desert.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's used to a lot of minerals,
probably a super high soil pH with pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: low organic content.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, a little bit of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it sure does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was let's let's let's talk about
the first strain that you actually started
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding, breeding a line you started
working.
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn, I think I used.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I had a.
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn, I really just can't read.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: How old are you, son?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sixty two.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been doing this for half a century.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it gets harder over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, over the years, it's gotten a
lot harder for me to remember some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be just like, bam, bam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, just just wait till you pass fifty
five, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I can't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm already I'm all about walking in the
kitchen and go, what am I doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's like a mad scientist thing around
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got I got sticky notes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my Google calendar is busy all day
long.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I need all that shit to remind
me of what the fuck I'm doing all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I haven't even gotten to the point of
utilizing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just forget and say fucking smoke
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I give up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man, I can't do that because,
you know, when I when I'm especially if
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm selecting like I am now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I screw up even once, man, now I have
now I have a whole new set of variables I
[SPEAKER_05]: have to take into account.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, it's like I can't tell
you how many people I visit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to select a clone that'll
have like a closet or a small area of
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll be like, yeah, well,
I'm going to kill these three because
[SPEAKER_05]: they're not doing well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll be like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, your fan is blowing extra strong
on those three back plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really happening is they're dehydrating
faster.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're needing water sooner.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the reason they look shitty isn't
genetics.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to understand the environment
around them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like selecting in veg, like culling
in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh, it doesn't grow well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it could be the one that's the most
potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going for effect, not for structure
in veg.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you're super familiar with
the line, like I am with most.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like the embodiment of Tasmania or the
Galapagos Islands.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a pretty sealed gene pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't walk outside of my gene pool very
often.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it works out really good for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's that's one of the best ways
to truly learn your lines and to master a
[SPEAKER_02]: line, to really, really get it into,
I mean, for lack of a better word,
[SPEAKER_02]: to master it, to get that bud grown to its
best expressions.
[SPEAKER_05]: To where you're familiar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I use marker expressions on
lines I'm real familiar with, like my own
[SPEAKER_05]: lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've worked with a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know if I have a square petiole right on
this one, I know that that that is a link
[SPEAKER_05]: gene to something I either want or don't
want as an example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, I get what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can select early.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can wipe out a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I can.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want early right in veg with
things I'm familiar with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for people listening, like a linked
trait could be like you see a certain leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: mutation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that in that line,
it happens to also denote another trait.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of times a lot of times it gets
a lot deeper than that, like patterns of
[SPEAKER_05]: leaf hairs, the patterns that they form in
certain places on the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my one of my favorite things to do
to be able to check plants early is I look
[SPEAKER_05]: at those, you know, the little round,
I forget what they're called.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're called coital bones or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the sprouts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are those are some of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I catch the plants about a week up
above ground, I always take a 30 times
[SPEAKER_05]: scope and look really close at those
leaves and look at the density of the leaf
[SPEAKER_05]: hairs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, what that does is since leaf hairs
and trichomes are pretty much exactly the
[SPEAKER_05]: same, just a little tiny move on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I then know which is most dense,
which can have the most dense trichomes
[SPEAKER_05]: right from go.
[SPEAKER_05]: This helps me a ton for man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not familiar with males.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if I'm a male from something I'm a
little familiar with or not that familiar
[SPEAKER_05]: with, I can get a good grip on how what my
potential is in my males to to pass off
[SPEAKER_05]: heavy resin production with the female for
the offspring, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That gives me my first little marker so I
can, you know, do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hang on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna grab.
Alright.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: That reminds me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but that's that's something I've never
never even considered.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm glad you like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the leaf the leaf hair things are
big.
[SPEAKER_05]: I use them to judge a lot of things and
it's like most people go right to the
[SPEAKER_05]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: They look at like leaf formations,
leaf, whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some some aspect expression of the leaf
and those work good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those work good for a lot of things but
the problem is with different environments
[SPEAKER_05]: and with any type of grain, especially a
hybrid if it's not an IBL.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll throw out just on the notch.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll throw out different morphologies,
different resin values, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's still testing the water.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's getting a grip on the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and in today's society, we know like
almost everything's a poly poly poly poly
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid in the cookie world unless you're
unless you have a a nice sealed
[SPEAKER_02]: environment away from that kind of BS like
yours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, my worry is I it's not
that I think anything is particularly bad
[SPEAKER_05]: or particularly good in in the recent 20
years or so but the problem I have is is
[SPEAKER_05]: it's is it's useless for me to try to run
down the origin of some type of genetics
[SPEAKER_05]: that I get because I'm involved with two
or three people at least with one or two
[SPEAKER_05]: of them at least have just gotten it and
decided to rename it something else and
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe embellish on the history.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I just I just don't trust anything I
hear now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I have my my Galapagos Islands gene
pool that I and man, I got a lot of seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: from a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just working through them now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I told you recently, I just got a G,
I just got some G thirteen haze from Soma
[SPEAKER_05]: to Pop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gotta be thirty years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are that's a really good line too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's where they found the the
CBD stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the the CBD basis for a can of
tonic and stuff like that was in someone's
[SPEAKER_02]: G thirteen haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the haze would definitely have some
CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, because it's not just the resin
production, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a lot like with uh let me just
think of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, like let's take a Congo for example,
okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: Several times I've seen congos that suck,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Several times I've seen congos that look
like they'd be okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like a real dark kind of
spooky looking bud but you don't see much
[SPEAKER_05]: resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it just uh and it will kick your
I mean bad, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you were to chop that bud in half
and look at it, you would see that it
[SPEAKER_05]: forms as different.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's resin different than an indica would.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a lot of the indicas were bred
to make hash, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, they always wanted the resin spread
out all over the whole plant so they could
[SPEAKER_05]: all extract it with hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sativas are a lot different, especially
some of the really wild ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll condense their resin production as
you get closer to the core of the flower
[SPEAKER_05]: to protect it from the weather basically
is what.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's why you can have a sativa that
to your naked eye, you can go,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh yeah, that looks alright and it will
lay you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you look at a lot of these old
sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at some Highland Tide Bud I
had from Bodhi Save and if you look at it
[SPEAKER_02]: like if I guess if a modern person that
like in the that started growing in the
[SPEAKER_02]: 2020s looked at it, they wouldn't even
understand what to smoke on it because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's almost all leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's no floral density to it
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we had those and matter of fact,
when I went to Northern California,
[SPEAKER_05]: they had just gotten pretty flush with
those exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those ones from Afghanistan and the
Mideast that were not really buds,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: They were just like leaf bud florets or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and they were just covered in resin,
you know, just these big non dense flowers
[SPEAKER_05]: just soaked with resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's talk about some of your lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you've made a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so many lines over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of your flagships is the what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Blue Rhino 1947.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of your staples.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I when we first started talking,
I think that was one of the big ones
[SPEAKER_02]: you're working with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, I still love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of my favorite go to smokes of
all time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of heavy on the indica side but
you wouldn't know it by smoking it because
[SPEAKER_05]: it doesn't really relate that kind of
sleepy side too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't give you munchies too much but
what it does do is it it reminds me a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I I mentioned Bhutan earlier as it reminds
me of some Bhutanese, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That have this this resin profile where
the high type is like, I don't know how to
[SPEAKER_05]: describe it other than it's golden and
happy, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything is like golden and you're happy
and that's what the Blue Rhino does.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Blue Rhino 1947 does for me but it's
most unique property that I have found in
[SPEAKER_05]: nothing else is that I have some I I have
a lot of damage actually but one of my
[SPEAKER_05]: major damage zones is in my leg,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I took some really bad nerve damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is is when I'm up and walking
around because of all that damage along
[SPEAKER_05]: with bone damage and other stuff but when
I'm up and walking around, I have to hold
[SPEAKER_05]: my muscles in that leg tight, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because any loose, if I step down a step
that's not there or something,
[SPEAKER_05]: man, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on, I'm on a cane for a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bad, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the Blue Rhino 1947 after a day when I
lay down to go to sleep of if I'm up and
[SPEAKER_05]: around, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: My leg will get spasms when it relaxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that hurts the hell out of me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the Blue Rhino 1947, I can just pop
some of that and those spasms are just
[SPEAKER_05]: reduced to a tiny, tiny little rumble that
doesn't hurt at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, while I don't use it for pain relief
directly, it absolutely cures me from the
[SPEAKER_05]: pain I would be suffering.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I always have Blue Rhino 1947 always.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, do you think that's from the blueberry
side or what's in the Blue Rhino?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Blueberry White Rhino and Peak 19
and AK 47.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peak 19 and AK 47.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got the, I got the Peak 19 AK 47 from
Seabay many, many, many, many moons ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember who made that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pardon me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember who made that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's a hybrid of Sega and something
else but I do not know who made that one
[SPEAKER_05]: but I use but I use the Irish Rose version
of Blue Rhino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just crossed them up and you know,
it's a, it's an impactive line anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the high is impressive but even
beyond that, I started noticing that stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: with the tremors in my leg and went,
oh, there really is medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, the first time I realized
that was when I had for myself anyways,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a abscess tooth, an abscess molar
and it was just, it was one of those ones
[SPEAKER_02]: where it was like tears running down your
face.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the only thing you can feel in your
body is that pain just throbbing and
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing was working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gabs, nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I smoked some very weak blueberry
just because I happen to have it and it
[SPEAKER_02]: completely took away the nerve pain and I
realized, oh, this, this for me helps with
[SPEAKER_02]: nerve pain insanely like a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was wondering if that maybe helped
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: At first, I really thought it was the
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did for several years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought was the blueberry but then as I
started to inbreed them and mess with them
[SPEAKER_05]: and look at different ones that were
better at exactly that nerve damage stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed that the ones I would select
that would be the best would
[SPEAKER_05]: morphologically, they would look the most
like the peak 19.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just kind of naturally made the leap
and thought it must be the peak 19 that's
[SPEAKER_05]: doing it, but I could, I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the, the blueberries that I've had
usually smell like blueberry, the ones
[SPEAKER_02]: that helps my nerve pain because I have
neuropathy bad and that tends to help me a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot, but I also like, when you mentioned
white rhino, like one of my white whales
[SPEAKER_02]: is white rhino, like a very good white
rhino cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I had one, it's just the one time
ever that we just made me see tracers and
[SPEAKER_02]: hallucinate like LSD and it was white
rhino.
[SPEAKER_02]: So man, that's a special line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to smoke a ton of white rhino when
we were out taking care of stuff outdoors
[SPEAKER_05]: and white rhino works really good outdoors
because it's also hardly smelly at all
[SPEAKER_05]: when you grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have your riffraff tie, which I know is
a popular one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's, that's a real grape
grapefruity baby right there, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, some people are hunting grapefruit
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: People keep talking about it too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: The riffraff tie is like, you could call
it grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, I just want people to
know that there was tie in it and then
[SPEAKER_05]: it's, you know, kind of muggled up,
not pure tie, but I mean, damn you talk
[SPEAKER_05]: about grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That, that baby is full.
[SPEAKER_05]: With a cure, it just gets 10 times
stronger.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's radical.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's in the, what's in it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Riffraff tie is a deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's see, which tie did I use?
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember if it was the,
I had gotten sent from my cousin in
[SPEAKER_05]: Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when he sent it to me, the paper or
whatever it was wrapped in said bat damn
[SPEAKER_05]: bang on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just called that bat damn bang tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good name too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other tie I had that I worked
with was from a breeder that I hooked up
[SPEAKER_05]: with that was in Denmark or Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he wanted to trade me some juicy fruit
tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For something I had, I forget what it was,
but I was like, Oh hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was legit juicy fruit tie.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was long flowering smell just
like juicy fruit gum was kick ass.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the riffraff tie, I forget which one
it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was one of those, one of those two.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll say so in the description.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So check the photographic memory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need one of those too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine's just damaged, damaged, damaged like
memento.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, if anybody's interested in the
website, it's kingdom, organic seeds.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely go out, go check those out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we want to talk about some more of
your stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know my friend smellboat would kill me
if I didn't ask.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask about the cherry tie, the chunky
cherry tie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you know, something this,
I love that for so many reasons,
[SPEAKER_05]: but the first thing I really liked about
was when I saw the offspring, I knew
[SPEAKER_05]: because sometimes when you're working with
like it usually happens with the land race
[SPEAKER_05]: or an heirloom long IBL, when you pop it
into a hybrid, usually what will happen is
[SPEAKER_05]: they will just merge, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll, it'll, the resulting will be
uniform.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it will blend.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty uniform in the F1 times that
doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's like they resist each other
a little, and you definitely get lots of
[SPEAKER_05]: different recombinations.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what happened with the chunky
cherry tie.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as soon as I saw some starting to
finish at about 10 or 11 weeks,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I saw others that had two more weeks
to go, I was like, Oh yeah, I knew.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, Oh my God, when I smoked them,
there was one I had that was a 14 week
[SPEAKER_05]: finisher and it was, it was so close to
just tie.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was just like smoking tie.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was slightly different, but not very.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I treasure that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have deep stashed buds of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's incredibly like tie.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's almost spot on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know my friend smellboat used just the
cherry tie part in his rainbow and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: one of his favorite lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cherry pot tie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the, you need a little
selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: There, but there are one out of four of
those females are just stellar.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have any bad ones, but there's
like, you know, out of, out of like four
[SPEAKER_05]: females, you would probably get two
average ones, one really good one,
[SPEAKER_05]: and one epic one.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it spread the, if it spread the
bandwidth, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an even distribution of the
expressions.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what else we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, let's talk about, do you remember
a string called uncle Lucius lemonade?
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have uncle Lucius lemonade.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that was a big hit on skunk
magazines forums back in the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: the uncle Lucius lemonade.
[SPEAKER_02]: All my friends were grabbing them,
popping them, loving it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that one about?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've almost popped it here in the last six
months.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've almost popped it twice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've had it out and ready to roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then something else came up and I
went, Oh, and had to go a different
[SPEAKER_05]: direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm definitely going to rework it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That again, the only problem is it takes a
lot of work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was talking to you earlier about if
I'm working with things I'm really
[SPEAKER_05]: familiar with, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, blue around 1947,
let's say I can pop eight.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I want to continue the line,
I can usually get away with one wave of
[SPEAKER_05]: eight sprouts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can select from there and be good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Find everybody I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I might have to do that twice,
but usually not because I'm familiar with
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that works out really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the uncle Lucius lemonade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that's made from a lemon rec that a
friend of mine brought me in about 2004,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lemon rec clone up from Northern
California, up from Willets.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was an intense train wreck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super lemony.
[SPEAKER_05]: It must have developed a sport mutation or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it had become super lemony.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but it also had another couple other
weaknesses that may have come along with
[SPEAKER_05]: the lemony flavor was it was real weak.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had no structural integrity and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I crossed it with another heavy,
hard hitter, the iron Cindy, which is a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot like a train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I crossed it with that to make
uncle Lucius lemonade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the problem with the original uncle
Lucius was or with the original lemon rec
[SPEAKER_05]: was that it had some Hermes in it,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to weed those out and they weren't
the easy kind to weed out.
[SPEAKER_05]: They weren't true Hermes.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were the kind you don't find out
until two weeks before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was brutal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just weak breeding, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have to fish through them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now, in order to run those and then
breed them, I'm gonna need to run 16
[SPEAKER_05]: sprouts to start with and cross my fingers
that I can find what I need in that run
[SPEAKER_05]: because those are particularly dangerous.
[SPEAKER_05]: First, I have to find true males for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I have to find a female that can take
some stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to beat the shit out of them to
find out who has the least tolerance for
[SPEAKER_05]: stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: So once I find that, I will do it because
that is some of the most lemony stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: man, ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people run into that a lot with
the train wrecks.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of intersex stuff, a lot of intersex
traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's even auto flowering traits in the
line somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: But man, for me, there's not a much better
hide than train wreck stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those ones just that I
associate with Thai type highs kind of in
[SPEAKER_02]: there that make me happy, energetic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thai makes me happy and energetic for
sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes totally spaced out, depends on
how much I smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the train wrecks, any train wreck I've
ever smoked, I'm not a big fan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they're potent, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they have a quality to me that is not
dissimilar than when you take something
[SPEAKER_05]: two weeks late, you get how the resin
changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how they always remind me of.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've even tried taking them a little early
and that doesn't change.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a personal thing like you and
millions of people love train wreck.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I have nothing against the fact
that it just kind of makes me feel like
[SPEAKER_05]: it's weed that was taken too late.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always get that vibe from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, with train wrecks, people
either, and it's kind of like that with
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack Harrow too, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's because of the turps,
maybe it's because of the high too,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's either people love it or they're
just like, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people, it makes speedy and
paranoid, like crazy paranoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just never does it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of Afghanis do it to me and
Skunk One does it to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to see the queen of paranoid,
that black forest I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about some of the black forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't tell you how many people I've sent
running for the hills with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where they go, yeah, well, you get a
little paranoid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I go, well, I wouldn't smoke it if I was
you, if that's the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, they don't listen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, they run for the hills
because that thing's just a pure jungle
[SPEAKER_05]: black Vietnamese who knows how many years
old it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Across with my old cherry bomb male,
which, God, I love that cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the cherry bomb?
[SPEAKER_05]: That was an F3 out of Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was, it was a combination of about
three or four Hawaiian sativas,
[SPEAKER_05]: elephant ear, puna butter, a couple
others.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was crossed with a cherry AK-47.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it was inbred a few times to F3.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was shared with me under some kind
of top secret, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how the Hawaiians do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are tight with their stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Top secret.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, when I got it, the first thing
I noticed, the first couple of things I
[SPEAKER_05]: crossed it with is it was sort of,
it was sort of submissive.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it would impart larger yields
and it would impart added resin,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it wouldn't really contribute too much
to turps or high type or morphology to any
[SPEAKER_05]: big degree.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really liked it because I could blend
it with almost anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would come out mostly whatever else
was in the hybrid.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it would always be like 80-20
instead of a 50-50.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, I bred that with the Vietnamese
black, which I got from my cousin back in,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, I think it was like maybe
the late 80s or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've kept the Vietnamese black line
around that long?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I still have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just popped three.
[SPEAKER_05]: A few months ago because I just inbred
the, I just inbred the black forest by
[SPEAKER_05]: getting a male from the original V black
line using him to do a soft backcross to
[SPEAKER_05]: the black forest.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now it's like the black forest runs
over anything it crosses anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long does that flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: 16 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I bet that's got to be so killer
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, peeps have problems with it
because if you never have flowered a 16
[SPEAKER_05]: week plant in a container, you may have
some issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that are used to land races and
heirloom lines and long flowering lines
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really got to do your homework before
you start flowering them puppies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know, shit, not only do you
have to select the shit out of them and
[SPEAKER_05]: keep them, overloving them is the death
sentence to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you start trying to pour food on
them or switch their pH fast or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your bone over watering, all kinds of
shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus people, people will take them as the
common mistake with a black forest or
[SPEAKER_05]: anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like up 14 weeks or something is
they'll get to about the 10, 11 week mark
[SPEAKER_05]: and they'll be, Oh shit, my plants dying.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to transplant it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's like the worst possible thing
you could do in flowering because suddenly
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant gets this dose of all kinds of
available nitrogen and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it says yay time to veg.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what that means is time to reduce
resin production.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're in flowering and you're
reducing resin production, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Counterintuitive as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I tell people you're feeding
cannabis, not tomatoes, because tomatoes
[SPEAKER_02]: like some nitrogen in calcium and veg and
stuff, but cannabis, nitrogen kills resin
[SPEAKER_02]: production and flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your plant will get really happy and we're
starting to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe even mutate growth a little bit,
but well, it's like with tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if, if you were overdosing your
tomatoes with nitrogen at the end,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you were sort of fading your tomatoes,
you'll get really big gnarly tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they'll have thick skin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super thick, robust, thick skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the lines that I probably
associate with you the most, and that I
[SPEAKER_02]: get asked about the most when people ask
about your lines is iron Cindy.
[SPEAKER_02]: People love the iron Cindy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically a haze for my money,
you know, it's like, it's just like a
[SPEAKER_05]: faster flowering haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a slightly longer flowering Cindy
because Cindy and haze have a lot in
[SPEAKER_05]: common.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cindy and Southeast Asian have a lot in
common.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the metal haze was kind of a no brainer
that I wanted to cross with it,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of makes a really nice outdoor
plant too for the metal haze, a better
[SPEAKER_02]: frame for it and everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what kind of, what kind of turps are
you seeing in the iron Cindy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it, did you use a pineapple C99,
a grapefruit?
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of you're using?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, I just used, I just selected some,
I think I used a couple of females for
[SPEAKER_05]: that, maybe more than a couple,
but I just took some good Cindy's and
[SPEAKER_05]: crossed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to get a bad Cindy.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only, the only bad Cindy are every
once in a while, I would say one in eight
[SPEAKER_05]: are super small yielding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only really bad Cindy I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just yields really small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it probably has heavy resin production
and all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's funny too, because you know
something in any line I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have, you know, usually they're big
fat plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually if you get one, a phenotype that
has like, let's say 25% less yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will also have about 25% more potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's all the energy elsewhere for
the plant, I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love how, how, how just intuitive it is
as a, as a plant and how, how quickly it
[SPEAKER_02]: adapts everything, everything about the
plant eating balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times we talk about on our show
about like expressions and clonal
[SPEAKER_02]: expression, meaning, you know,
a lot of people used to call it genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: drift, but it's not necessarily a thing,
but taking a clone from one environment to
[SPEAKER_02]: another and watching how quickly it
adapts, how quickly it will change its
[SPEAKER_02]: form even.
[SPEAKER_05]: You, my man know the important stuff if
you ask me, because that is it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I call it adaptability as a general,
but yeah, one of the first things I do to
[SPEAKER_05]: my plants to check them out is back in the
day, we used to call it the breeders in
[SPEAKER_05]: Northern California used to call it growth
hormone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what it is is basically when you take
a plant and you top it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see how fast it comes back with the
axial branches.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you top it again.
[SPEAKER_05]: See how fast it comes back with the actual
branches.
[SPEAKER_05]: Top all those.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you see how many times before you
actually slow the process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, of course, you got to keep the
resources all in line here during this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you got to have container size
and food and what, because you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's now putting up 20 leads or whatever,
but, but that's how you can tell a plant
[SPEAKER_05]: has like the superior vigor from hell.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it can come back four times and still
be just the Hemingway.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the ones I worked with a long time
ago, the cherry Hemingway before it was
[SPEAKER_05]: the cherry Hemingway.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the Hemingway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a Bhutanese mad plant that thing,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friends would tell me it's broken out
of the grow room window and ate the
[SPEAKER_05]: neighbor's dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you talk about vigor.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could just, you prune the shit out of
that plant and you just make it mad.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it comes back.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's adaptability right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the things I always look for
with all my plant breeders is I test them
[SPEAKER_05]: that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I always took the crap out of
them and see how fast they come back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also I take advantage of any incidents
I might have where if my tent went away,
[SPEAKER_05]: all of a sudden it's 110 in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I watched those plants very closely
for the next few weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see who handled that best or,
or if something happens where I,
[SPEAKER_05]: I drought them all out and they all hurt
from droughts deaths.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a really good opportunity to see
what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great way to see what's up with
your plants and their ability to test for
[SPEAKER_02]: stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got to be, they got to be strong
first and foremost, you know, when I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: selecting them, I don't want any
weaknesses in there at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once I've got it down to all the strongest
plants, then I go to work on resin
[SPEAKER_05]: production turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see what's up with all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So aside from your breeding work,
which is, is completely prolific.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really well known.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you said, it's its own kind of
ecosystem where you've kept it very pure
[SPEAKER_02]: in its own form.
[SPEAKER_02]: And rarely do you bring anything in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're also very well known for your true
living organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a book out from green candy press
called true living organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about, let's, let's do a,
a step-by-step quick, basic organic
[SPEAKER_02]: introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you would, you would teach a
beginner, give them your, your best advice
[SPEAKER_02]: that you would give them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start with a beginner starting
into organics.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: TLO is simply an all natural style.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I say all natural style, I do mean
organic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But all organic styles aren't all natural.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could be growing organic with my earth
juice bottles and it would not be all
[SPEAKER_05]: natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be organic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the first difference there.
[SPEAKER_05]: TLO is an all natural style.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no liquid, anything, no
synthetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't cram organic acids in there to
force feed them, yada, yada, no synthetic
[SPEAKER_05]: processes in any of it or even any hot or
organic acids in any prolific amounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the next thing you need to know
about TLO is we leverage mother nature,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We take some advantage of the plants being
in containers like higher root
[SPEAKER_05]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That means there's more, you know,
you've seen an ant hill on a sunny day
[SPEAKER_05]: compared to an ant hill on a cloudy day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're moving like lightning on
the sunny day and they're all just,
[SPEAKER_05]: all right, same with your plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: When the roots are, the temperature around
the roots in a container are warm like
[SPEAKER_05]: that, that's pretty alien to the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: But mother nature comes to the rescue,
takes advantage of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can leverage all those things,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those warmer temperatures and the right
balance, the right pH, the right food,
[SPEAKER_05]: the right aeration, the right container
dynamics, you put the right water,
[SPEAKER_05]: you put all those together and not only is
it all natural growing, it's fricking
[SPEAKER_05]: supernatural, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, literally not just a tagline.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Supernatural.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were getting into the second part,
the second question of best advice you
[SPEAKER_02]: would give a TLO grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second part is from the movie
Ghostbusters, do not cross the streams.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of the most important things
and what fucks up the most people most
[SPEAKER_05]: often, right, is they have their grow
going really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's cranking along and they
decide to add some sweet or some,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, super thrive or some kind of
elixir or yes, you know, because that just
[SPEAKER_05]: once you get how the all natural process
works, it's all about consistency,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about the plant and the soil all
getting used to their environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: The changes don't come rapidly.
[SPEAKER_05]: They come slowly.
[SPEAKER_05]: The plant loves it like that because it
grows super slowly, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't just blast in a bunch of
phosphorus or some kind of radical fulvic
[SPEAKER_05]: acid solution in there and think
everything's going to be okay because the
[SPEAKER_05]: first thing it's going to do is change the
pH in the soil radically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if you're a human, you might go,
cool, more food.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're a micro life in the soil,
you die.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it takes a whole two weeks for that to
come back to where it should be after a
[SPEAKER_05]: mistake like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that two weeks is during flowering,
well, as we discussed before, you're
[SPEAKER_05]: taking the way from resin production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instantly, instantly you're, you're
boofing your bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I mean, I don't get why anybody
would go through all that process of
[SPEAKER_02]: having this beautiful organic living soil
and add in just a little thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess that temptation is always
there though, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for, for people that are used to
bottles, grabbing that bottle real quick
[SPEAKER_02]: to make a quick adjustment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand it.
[SPEAKER_05]: My God, when I was making the
transformation myself, I bone that one
[SPEAKER_05]: many times myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet, I bet it's got to be a common
habit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So well, right out of the gate,
the problem, the problem is, right out of
[SPEAKER_05]: the gate, when you pour some of that on,
on your plant, oh, your plant looks wicked
[SPEAKER_05]: happy for a week, maybe 10 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It loves it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go, man, I made a great move.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then all of a sudden starts going to hell
and you're like, what's wrong?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's because it catches up in time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to go TLO, stay TLO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give it a fair, give it a fair shot.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, don't, don't decide when you've
got, you know, a couple or a few weeks
[SPEAKER_05]: left to go before harvest that you need a
phosphorus boost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when, when did you start your writing
career?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is a big part of your career
is writing, not just growing and writing
[SPEAKER_02]: about growing, but actually being an
author.
[SPEAKER_02]: When did that kind of come about?
[SPEAKER_05]: I met up with a guy who was a writer.
[SPEAKER_05]: His name was gooey.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just met with them online, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know shit about writing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could, I couldn't even spell the word,
the word article consistently.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would spell it raw.
[SPEAKER_05]: I spelled all kinds of things wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: My sentence structure suck anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he proposed an idea where he wrote for
skunk magazine at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he proposed an idea where we would
collaborate, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And we would just do some stuff together.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I stuck with him for probably,
I don't know, it was like a year,
[SPEAKER_05]: but what we would do is I would write,
then I would send it to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he would, he would fix it and then he
would send it back to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I would say, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because sometimes if you don't know how to
grow and you're editing somebody's
[SPEAKER_05]: writing, you screw it all up because you
don't know what you're saying.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: So along with correcting those kinds of
things, I also took really careful note on
[SPEAKER_05]: the writing corrections he made.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I started to get a grip on how he wrote
and how he structured his sentences,
[SPEAKER_05]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So after about two years, I guess a year
and a half of that, I broke out on my own
[SPEAKER_05]: and just started writing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did okay for a while and slowly came
up more and more and more in my skills of
[SPEAKER_05]: writing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at one point when skunk went
digital, they got the new, I forget what
[SPEAKER_05]: it's called, but the program that you
submit articles in, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got all its own little rules,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like how many words can be in a paragraph?
[SPEAKER_05]: How many paragraphs can be, how many words
and paragraphs can be under a heading?
[SPEAKER_05]: And all this stuff that I wasn't really
that familiar with.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that trained me a little further.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I can write pretty good,
standard issue pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have my own signature moves that I
pull off that aren't classic writing
[SPEAKER_05]: skills.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like whenever I'm writing,
I'm always imagining that I'm just sitting
[SPEAKER_05]: there talking to somebody at a pub or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm explaining whatever I'm writing to
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's funny because a lot of the people
who email me, they say exactly that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They go, I swear, man, I feel like I'm
just sitting next to you in a pub and
[SPEAKER_05]: you're just telling me stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why early your writing resonated
with me as I was growing up and reading
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk and doing all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it always resonated with me because
it's how I speak when I'm talking to
[SPEAKER_02]: someone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just familiar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't feel like someone's above you
talking down to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just feel like it's a bro talking
about growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, everybody has their own likes and
dislikes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I respect that totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like music or anything else or your
favorite food.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have your favorites right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your favorites change sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I go through periods where I'm just like,
oh god, yeah, I made some hash from some
[SPEAKER_05]: Cinderella 99 recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's a good move.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really good move.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, I just got to obliterate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really, for a writer of cannabis,
an author, a grower, an author,
[SPEAKER_05]: a breeder, I don't really smoke as much
weed as a lot of the people I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably because I'm older now because I
sure used to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I get something that's really
fine in my hands like that Cindy hash,
[SPEAKER_05]: I tend to go for, you know, maybe a week
just being the stoner from hell.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm walking around baked on hash all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's me when I start when I fire up the
Pub Co.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a good week or two where
I'm just stuck on stupid for a while and
[SPEAKER_02]: then I go back to flour and kind of get
into it slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That always.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hash also blows your whole ability to
smoke flowers too, because it raises your
[SPEAKER_05]: tolerance to a really high level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's no fun when you can't really
enjoy the fine complexities of a high in a
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I test stuff out, you know,
where sometimes the route I take for
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding is I will use since I'm really
good and fast at making hash, I'll take
[SPEAKER_05]: four plants, four females that I've never
seen all the way through flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll have my male or two or three,
however many I'm using in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then since I've seen this so many times,
and especially if I'm using something I
[SPEAKER_05]: know, I can look at the plants as they
seed up, watching very closely under
[SPEAKER_05]: magnification as they finish.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can tell who's got the most resin
production.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, the turpins become obvious
to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what I do is, is I make separate
hash balls from each female, because
[SPEAKER_05]: beyond the resin count, the resin
production, you have the resin coating,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: The profile itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So and that's what I'm really all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just take days where for three days I
smoke just hash from one, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: in the morning, noon, night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the next day or the next set of days
I smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it takes me, you know, a week or two
to go through four or five different
[SPEAKER_05]: females.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of that, I damn sure know which
ones I like best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you have a good idea how it gets you
because a lot of people like I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure people realize this, but I don't
know that they consciously realize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A strain doesn't always affect the same
person the same way at the same time of
[SPEAKER_02]: the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nor will it affect you the same way under
two different situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so variant how a high will make you
feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be smoking the exact same terps,
cannabinoid content, everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: but time of day, mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything matters when it comes to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every last minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree 100%.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like one of my favorite things to do
to test out, especially sativas,
[SPEAKER_05]: ones that are sativa dominant.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all just blaze a doobie or a
couple hits or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll blaze out on my bicycle and go
riding around and see what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll see what kind of energy motivation
weed it really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times I don't even get to really
truly experience a high until I get up and
[SPEAKER_02]: move around and start getting some action
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's usually when I figure out how truly
stoned I am.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can take note of things along the
way like something stay consistent like,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh, this is, well, I ate that whole box of
cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess it gives you the munchies
pretty hardcore, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you could tell something stay the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as your attitude, as far as how
it hits you mentally when you're on it,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's some that are just like I say,
those boutonnies or the Blue Rhino 1947.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a few others I have that just make
me have that golden.
[SPEAKER_05]: The life is beautiful thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's then there's those
strains where a stupid joke will make you
[SPEAKER_05]: laugh to where you almost choke to death.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just there's so many
different kinds out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I ran across somebody a
couple of years ago and, man, I'll always
[SPEAKER_05]: remember this guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He comes up to me once and he wants to
smoke a doobie with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, dude, is it organic or
whatever?
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, he goes, but it's really,
really powerful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, all right, well, let me have a
hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I smelled it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smelled good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I was like, OK, my first hit,
I could see it was gnarly, synthetic grown
[SPEAKER_05]: like so bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like miracle grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, oh, shit, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't want to piss you off.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he goes, dude, you won't believe how
high it gets.
[SPEAKER_05]: You and I go, let me let you in on a
little secret here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could spray the bud with raid.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you smoked it, you would get so
fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that they actually I've talked
about this before on the show back when I
[SPEAKER_02]: was in my teens in Bakersfield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the time we were getting in
Mexican compressed during that during the
[SPEAKER_02]: 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting Mexican compressed and we're
young.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have access to dink up and
humble.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have cars to drive around.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were young poor kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in a certain area of town,
you could go get Mexican.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it always had this weird floral,
perfumey smell to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Later on, I found out they were spraying
with raid because they would they would
[SPEAKER_02]: sell it and they'd call it nade.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought that was the strain name.
[SPEAKER_02]: But later on, I found out they're spraying
literally with raid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it will get you really, really high.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sure will.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just take a shortcut and inhale some raid
if that's what you want to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Up on some raid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't have fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I know it's shocking what people
will do to their weed just to to give an
[SPEAKER_02]: effect, even if it has nothing to do with
the natural processes of the plant or the
[SPEAKER_02]: high of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've converted many, many people just by
giving them some weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they'll hit me with a weed and
they'll go, oh, this is the best weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say compared to what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not compared to this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This little number.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll give them like a quarter ounce of
it or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And within the time of no more than a few
days, it never takes more than a few days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next thing they're doing, man,
they're asking me how to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want details.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're selling all their other shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They think it's crap now because
especially synthetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you're someone who can't tell
the difference between synthetic grown
[SPEAKER_05]: weed and organic or all natural grown
weed, you need to solve that problem
[SPEAKER_05]: first, because there is a hell of a
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means you're not smoking enough
different good growers if you don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: the difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's synthetic weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could take one hit of real shitty
synthetic weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my throat's through for the rest of
the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're blowing out blowing up coughs out
your throat all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All hot and shitty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty typical for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, you know, if that's your game.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's what you like and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but don't don't throw it on me
and try to tell me it's organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't tell me it's the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like if you haven't smoked a
good sampling of all that's out there and
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of different types of growing stuff,
you really don't truly know until you have
[SPEAKER_02]: that experience and it got the breadth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can tell the difference between
organic, you know, shitty synthetic and
[SPEAKER_02]: the difference in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just looking at the ash.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's just that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But and that's just the elegance of the
smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how elegant and smooth it is when
you're organic or all natural.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're you're miles above anything
synthetic all the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But from, you know, I've never smoked
really organically grown bottle weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I call it soup style organically grown
weed with bottles that has been really
[SPEAKER_05]: offensive unless the person has decided to
goose their plants at the end with a bunch
[SPEAKER_05]: of potassium and phosphorus, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they don't fade, an organic bottle will
grow well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be harsh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing like synthetics can be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, you can pick it up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm sure you've smoked those
dibbies where the cherry will sizzle like
[SPEAKER_05]: a sparkler a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's mega potassium still in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mega potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you're going to pour like heavy
potassium or like phospho on your plants
[SPEAKER_02]: at the end of an organ or a yellow grow,
just just don't just don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to fool anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just you're not.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, potassium and phosphorus are both
elements that you absolutely do not want
[SPEAKER_05]: to goose your plants with pretty much ever
if you're in soil, no matter what you're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: In nature, potassium and phosphorus don't
come in highly available forms.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're taken in very slowly stored.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's another thing with breeding
that I also noticed.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is along with like what we were
talking about before with how vigorous and
[SPEAKER_05]: what I used to call the growth hormone,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: How adaptable they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was I just talking about?
[SPEAKER_05]: See how I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: See how I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the curse of the old person.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's OK, Mr. Magoo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, what am I doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did I go?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was I talking about?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So potassium and phosphorus are just meant
to be taken up super slowly over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, and stored in the plant and
along with certain abilities of certain
[SPEAKER_05]: plants over other plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those abilities is to be able to
store and acquire nutrients like
[SPEAKER_05]: potassium, calcium, phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants are a breeding trait here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're selecting some plants can
store a lot of those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some plants have a hard time getting it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some plants don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's just how well they work in
synchronicity with the soil life.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's how adaptable.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's kind of their more wilder
side coming back to them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing I noticed going through your
stuff, I don't think you have any OG Kush
[SPEAKER_02]: in your lines, do you?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I do not.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like OG Kush, but at the same
time, the past 20 years has been
[SPEAKER_02]: bombarded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything has OG in it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you always have that turf profile
somewhere in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just realizing, wait a minute,
this is an enigma.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a thing you don't find very often.
[SPEAKER_02]: A breeder that's still going, didn't work
OG Kush in their lines and is still
[SPEAKER_02]: successful making great lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's special.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like OG Kush, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kicks my ass.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's the guys who first made that
were guys from Northern California who
[SPEAKER_05]: went down to LA, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were the guys who built that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was devastating.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a day wrecker because the legs
aren't super long.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, it would be a day wrecker if
the legs were longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just disabling.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm in bed and I feel like,
shit, OG Kush should be perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just hammer me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hammer me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to be doing much else
besides maybe get a haircut and watch a
[SPEAKER_05]: movie and not follow it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a time and place for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't use that weed, but that's not
usually my go-to type.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't want to use it because I
mostly breed with stuff I like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even though I'm not the usual,
I'm not the regular, I'm not the majority.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people like strains and varieties
that are different than the ones I like
[SPEAKER_05]: the most.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tend to lean a little more sativa in my
likes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or most people lean a little more indica
in their likes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not that I don't like indicas.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just if I'm going to have a go-to
weed that I'm a busy guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do a lot of shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't need something to hammer me
down and make me eat some pancakes and go
[SPEAKER_05]: to sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that don't help nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want something where I could be high and
happy, still functional.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm stoned as hell, but I'm still good
to operate.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like, da.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I admire that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I admire that because it's so easy to go
with the crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: I push OGs, oh, things are going a little
bit slower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's push some OG in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's hip now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just never did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I admire that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that punk rock ethos.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I love about the Rev.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I sure got offered enough of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you were there for the beginning
of it, all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that you stuck to your guns.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what makes you special.
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the Rev's white whale?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's a strain that either you had and
lost or a strain that you're hunting,
[SPEAKER_02]: a strain that you just always wanted,
or a turp profile that you always wanted?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm pretty good with making turp
profiles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm usually pretty close.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen enough of them blend,
so I know close to where they're gonna go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then individuals in that batch,
I can usually find it, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as the strain, I would love to
have back that the police got from me
[SPEAKER_05]: after I first moved here was my Panama Red
clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the craziest fucking plants you've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: A jungle sativa, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: This thing would grow roots that would
shoot straight up out of the ground for a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple inches.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they would turn around and go
straight back into the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'd have all these root loops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then new plants would start growing
off of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You think that's weird?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me tell you something else.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how the male plants in some
strains, some rare varieties, they're
[SPEAKER_05]: usually landrace heirloom types?
[SPEAKER_05]: They have those nubs at the base of the
stem.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mean it from being too humid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they actually have little nubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, they reinforce the bottom third of
their stems with these, like, armor nubs,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Panama Red had spikes on those nubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were pointy little, like,
thorns on those nubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you talk about a dinosaur freaking
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And DJ Short absolutely described it to a
T.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the tequila of weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: What makes you say that?
[SPEAKER_05]: It is psychoactive, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is off your rocker, down the rabbit
hole, complete takeover of everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: It warms you so thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost like mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just your auditory or your
visual.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything is affected hardcore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your brain is just going 20 directions at
once.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like your head is zooming.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's moving through space really fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, just like, whoa, like that ad
for those speakers that time, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just kicking your ass.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like a Durban poison, it has waves,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's creeper.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first 10 minutes after you smoke
it, you go, damn, damn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then five minutes after that, you go,
oh, whoa, it's not done.
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 minutes after that, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just keeps going.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just keeps thumping you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you just go deeper and deeper.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great, great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never seen a true clone of it or what
looks to me like a true offspring of it
[SPEAKER_05]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I haven't dabbled.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I never gave the clone to anybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't have any backup.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the cops have gotten a lot of really
good strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did you source that one?
[SPEAKER_05]: From a friend of mine down in Nicaragua.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a long time ago, I used to get this
hash, right, from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_05]: This red hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we used to take the boat and go down
to the, what are those islands?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just off in Mexican, not Catalina.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the islands just south of San
Diego, across the border.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ones that are named after the squid?
[SPEAKER_05]: Coronado Islands.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coronado Islands.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Coronado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, not Coronado, San Diego,
but Coronado Island, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we used to rendezvous there and I'd
always get the hash there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he was the one who was always
talking about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Panama red.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as soon as he said that, of course,
I was like, yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Panama red.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he goes, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, yeah, I have a clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, can you bring that with you
next time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, yeah, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was real nonchalant about it for such
a, whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: What year was this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, 82.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legit shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legit time for Panama red to be going
around and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, you know, the closest thing to
it now that if you could source,
[SPEAKER_05]: as far as I know, would be, what was that
stuff?
[SPEAKER_05]: The Big Sur hollyweed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has real Panama red in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice fucking potent, potent old sativa
type.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Panama red.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way you describe it reminds me of how
Tom Hill talks about his haze,
[SPEAKER_02]: a specific, you know, in his haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a lot like killer hazes,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That same psychoactive, just blow,
I mean, blow your mind high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he was talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I don't even know why anybody
grows anything, but that he's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if it's, if it takes 10 and
500 to find one of them, it's better than
[SPEAKER_02]: any weed you'll ever smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, everybody's an idiot for not
working with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I was like, wow, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, it sounds like that this high
truly does exist in cannabis in some form.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredibly impressive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say that as an understatement.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you ever smoke it, it will,
I hope it's still right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope somebody has a hybrid of it
somewhere or something, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or somebody resources the real deal
because it legit comes from the edges of
[SPEAKER_05]: the Panamanian jungle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, just right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't go into too deep to have to get
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He told me a lot about it, but again,
I'm old and I forget a lot of the details,
[SPEAKER_05]: but he had a lot of details about it,
but just looking at the plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, it was red purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, all over it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it a purple flower plant?
[SPEAKER_05]: Bottoms of the leaves were purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the veins were purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: The stems were purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: The buds were purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the buds are dark purple, you know,
but everything else was kind of a reddish
[SPEAKER_05]: purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those roots that would go back in the
ground and start new plants, it was just
[SPEAKER_05]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds a lot like the Dolores strain
too, that was around a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, who talks about Dolores?
[SPEAKER_02]: Robert Clark, maybe one of those guys,
they know about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an old, I don't know if it's
South American or Mexican hybrid,
[SPEAKER_02]: but similar, very similar in the looks,
a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, I think it's in Big Star Holy
Week, the Dolores like is a portion of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be interesting to see if we could
find a way to find a strain similar to
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a haze, a really good haze is very
similar, very similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Tom was nailing it on the head with his
haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I mean, if you find a good haze,
some are easier than others.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, we went through some,
the first haze I remember, it was like 18
[SPEAKER_05]: weeks flowering indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember where it was sourced from,
that one?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that came from the surfers.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those came from my buddy's surfer
connection.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had those, but that one was just
even, and just the seeds from like any
[SPEAKER_05]: hybrid of that one, you know, they never
inbred it, but they hybridized it a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like the Vietnam black, the jungle
sativa, it walks all over anything you
[SPEAKER_05]: would cross it with like 90%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something would have to be an IBL 10 or 15
or greater to even have a chance to play a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit in the offspring recombination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a personal question just for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you keep seeds pure of the Vietnam
black?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I just did.
[SPEAKER_05]: The soft back cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just released the black forest F2,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: In brackets, it says BX2.
[SPEAKER_05]: BX1, small BX1.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I didn't take it back to the
original individual Vietnam black,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I took it back to a super superior
male that had all the good signs on him.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I back crossed it to the line,
not the individual.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a generation of black forest that
I just released, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be wampin' wampin' Vietnam
black sativa.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to require not much looking
through because again, I've never seen a
[SPEAKER_05]: bad one of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all decent.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are probably three out of 10,
two out of 10 that are extreme.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, extreme.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know most of the people have
only been sourcing Vietnam black via,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember who brought it to the
scene, but I know Jojo passed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Vietnam black that was in Willie
Nelson and Billy Goat also used one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact that there's a whole nother
separate Vietnam black line from back in
[SPEAKER_02]: the daylight, that's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of people are going to
be interested to know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that came from my cousin in Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_05]: He sent those to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is super sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always assumed it was the same one as
the Billy Goat one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Knowing that just has me a thousand times
more interested to see more of what
[SPEAKER_02]: Vietnam has to hold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vietnamese.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the Cambodians, there's just so
many Southeast Asians I love.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, Bhutanese is a Southeast Asian,
but they're far from hazelike.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who did you source that?
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a unique one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bhutan was a closed kingdom for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, I got those.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a buddy of mine in China.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he's kind of a buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We email back and forth about stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he gets me stuff sent out of there.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's done it twice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the things he sent me was this,
what was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Bhutan.
[SPEAKER_05]: He called it Gold Bhutan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, it was right from the base of the
Tibetan mountain there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where it was harvested at.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it smelled just like fuel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like strong honey oil fuel.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so awkward and gnarly.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we called it Bhutan gas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bhutan gas because it smelled like fuel.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we called it Bhutan gas, that line.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I crossed with the
Hemingway.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I crossed that with the cherry
bomb and made the cherry hemi.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the cherry hemi is a real cool
collaboration of a lot of strange exotic
[SPEAKER_05]: shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a real wild side to that
Bhutanese.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you piss off that Bhutanese or anything
with Bhutanese in it, she's going to hurt
[SPEAKER_05]: me and get pissed on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would imagine so.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a wild, jungly place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen there are strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Bhutan, I know that there are wild
cannabis growing literally all over
[SPEAKER_02]: randomly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even from house to house, 100 meters apart
might have different little cultivars or
[SPEAKER_02]: strains or whatever they have going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they tend to be pretty jungly,
wild stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, same with South Africa from farm to
farm or Jamaica from grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can have slight variations on stuff
because of whatever their breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: practices are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and elevation, all of it,
especially in some of those island places
[SPEAKER_02]: where elevation goes from sea floor to
high super fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: More UV is always good up to a point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So too much UV.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like if you grow plants in all day,
full sunshine, and then you grow a clone
[SPEAKER_05]: of that plant under all day laughing
sunshine or dappled sunshine, you're
[SPEAKER_05]: probably going to get a 10% bigger yield
or 15% bigger yield on your all day
[SPEAKER_05]: sunshine.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that 10% or 15% is just pure vegetable
fiber from the UV.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just makes everything bigger,
not better.
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually reduces the potency of the
resin because it swells up everything so
[SPEAKER_05]: gnarly.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the UV is just promoting that
vegetable growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we used to take, for our commercial
interests, we would grow full sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for our plants that we smoke,
we build laughings over them or we kept
[SPEAKER_05]: them positioned around trees so they would
only get half a day of full sunshine and
[SPEAKER_05]: then half a day of dappled sunshine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really good advice, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some of these longer flowering indoor
strings that you have, would you recommend
[SPEAKER_02]: a different light hour time for indoors on
some of your longer flowering strings?
[SPEAKER_05]: A different what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Light flowering time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how most people go to 12 hours as
a standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever recommend different flowering
times for any of your strains?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if it comes from the equator,
anywhere around the equator, what I will
[SPEAKER_05]: always do to it is during the second half
of flowering, I'll either drop my photo
[SPEAKER_05]: period to 12-5, 11-5, or 13-11.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or 11-13, I mean, with a little 13 hours
of darkness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they grow pretty much year round
with very slight photo period changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I've had people have long
flowering sativas all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many times they've told me, it won't stop
flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you just cut your light hours from
12 to 11 and that'll fix that in two
[SPEAKER_05]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I ran into a Malawi.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first time I ever ran into
something like this and I had it in 12
[SPEAKER_02]: hours of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the first time I ever learned
about light hours moving them or
[SPEAKER_02]: fluctuating them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like three months in,
nothing, no flower formations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hit up Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, Bodhi, what is going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I not know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, reduce your light hours,
Demi.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, reduce them, watch it,
watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then started reducing and we ended up
moving down to eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the end of eight, it would finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eight hours of light and it doesn't seem
like it's enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think it won't yield enough,
but it was perfect for that Malawi.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you only really have to do it for the
last few weeks, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I like sourcing geographical
varieties and strains because I know a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: about different strains from different
locales.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I know where it's from or where it's
constituents of the hybrid are from,
[SPEAKER_05]: I can assess all kinds of things right off
the bat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can assume a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that helps me a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I'm just, if somebody's offered me
some seeds, I'm like, well, where is this
[SPEAKER_05]: from?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did the genetics come from?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they go, well, it's blue pups,
blue boingo and gorilla funky cookie mass.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that tells me nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero tells you nothing about anything
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even know if it's an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's, if you don't know those specific
names for those strains, you have no clue
[SPEAKER_05]: at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, nor do I really trust people who I
don't know to tell me what's real.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they may in fact not no shade on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They may believe it's true because they
told them that they believe that and it
[SPEAKER_05]: wasn't true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I've heard, I've heard some good,
fantastic stories that I just don't think
[SPEAKER_05]: are true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, the road to hell is paved with
good intentions.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people who are great
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just warm hearted people that will tell
you information that isn't correct because
[SPEAKER_02]: they truly believe it to be true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they trusted the person who gave it to
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that person might be a great
trustworthy person, but the person that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just got it wrong once.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have somebody who'll grow,
I'm just going to use an example here of
[SPEAKER_05]: something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say a Cinderella 99, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll grow Cinderella 99 and they'll end
up with, I don't know, let's say five
[SPEAKER_05]: females, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of the females will be outstanding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like in my C C 99, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the headline now.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to look for something really
outstanding, what you're looking for is an
[SPEAKER_05]: extra beefy female.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: She is vigorous and extra beefy to the
max.
[SPEAKER_05]: She yields about 20% more than any other
Cindy and she is the most grape or the
[SPEAKER_05]: most pineapple-y, delicious, resin-soaked
killer ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my favorite cut, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's say somebody grows them and they
find that female, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's special, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So then they name her Griselda.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then they decide, fuck, I need to breed
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then what is the hybrid?
[SPEAKER_05]: X cross with Griselda.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not C 99.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you lose a bunch of the strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kills the anthropology of it all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I have to, you know,
I mean, I run it backwards in my head and
[SPEAKER_05]: go, oh, it's probably going to be like
this, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a lot of stuff I can
assess, but you tell me it's gooey cookie
[SPEAKER_05]: funk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, with, with, if we know that it's C
99, we can go, okay, Jack hair type,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, skunk one haze, Northern lights five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can, you know, you can easily break it
down, but yeah, once they start playing
[SPEAKER_02]: around past the baselines and it's just
random names and they aren't really,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's not a lot you can get from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, if I see something,
um, a line that is like eight things in
[SPEAKER_02]: it, like some people would get all
excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more hype strains are in it,
the more excited they get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it, but I, me, I walk away to sit
the second I see too many, because I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: like, I don't even know what I'm going to
get from this nor what I want to breathe
[SPEAKER_02]: with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's going to be completely
unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, unpredictable is an
understatement, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's a totally different way.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look on my site, you'll see that I
do have poly hybrids for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have a lot that are true two way F
ones truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Three way F ones and true four way F one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you have a five way or above of an F
one, then it starts to become a poly.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of the ones these days are like
10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember if not more, someone showed me
the seed finder page for animal mints.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went and looked at like,
cause you can do the strain map and see
[SPEAKER_02]: all the stuff in it listed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like four pages long of,
of everything laid out because it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: poly hybrid, poly hybrid, poly hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all ends up being OG Kush in the end,
but none of that really matters because
[SPEAKER_02]: they've crammed OG Kush into itself and
all of its expressions 90 times over,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, I like to keep everything
separate too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to know when I'm not double dipping
in some gene pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I, if I have a, a C 99 crossed with
an OG Kush and a C 99 crossed with a metal
[SPEAKER_05]: Hayes, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have those two strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Oh, I did it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: C 99 metal Hayes, C 99.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, you see what happens
when you have resin on your brain?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seeing my future right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Such a forgetful person.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you have those two, those two
varieties, those two hybrids, right now
[SPEAKER_05]: you smoke one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that gets me high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you go to smoke the other one.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go, yeah, that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it could be every bit as good as the
first one, but you've already built up
[SPEAKER_05]: some tolerance to the C 99 in the first
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the second C 99 hybrid is going to be a
little less impressive to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I'm testing things or sampling
them and want to know really more Bob,
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to make sure that I'm not cross,
cross encountering some things in two
[SPEAKER_05]: different ones because then I have to
adjust that into my whole deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not an obvious thing to think of
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like building tolerance to a specific
strain or type when you're doing testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So would you recommend like maybe the next
day, the following day, maybe smoking one
[SPEAKER_02]: in the morning and one at night and vice
versa the next day or you can,
[SPEAKER_05]: or you can clean your palate.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got, if you've got a couple of
hybrids that have a common P one,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you could just clean your palate in
between, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could see, you could sample one,
check it out and then go for something way
[SPEAKER_05]: out of the bandwidth.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then come back to the second one and then
sample it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do that a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_05]: That works really good for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give your, give your receptors time to
change a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my favorites to clean my palate
with is Congo, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: The Cindy Congo super well, because it's
one of those, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: the strains that you could be smoking
different weed all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be kind of baked, you know,
hanging around it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you smoked that weed where you
take a few hits and it just wipes out all
[SPEAKER_05]: the rest of anything you've ever smoked
and completely just takes over with a new
[SPEAKER_05]: high.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Congo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The breakthrough highs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always call those breakthrough highs.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just stomps out any kind of mild
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of smells come out of the Congo
that you work with?
[SPEAKER_05]: They are real like kind of rotten meat
with like a sickening sweet background.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a, it's acrid, but it's not fuely.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, it's like rotting meat is the
best way I could do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sweet, but in a kind of a sickeningly
sweet way, kind of like the Matanuska
[SPEAKER_05]: Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's weird that they smell a lot alike,
but they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder, I mean, does it smell like a
dead body maybe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause sweet, like I remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have to imagine what I mean when I
say that there's a sweet component to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like, I mean, it's like,
it's like, Ooh, but it's strangely
[SPEAKER_02]: compelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone I knew that worked in a,
in a funeral home always described the
[SPEAKER_02]: debt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they described this to me before I
smelled it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I would do, I would help them in
the, in the funeral home.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they said bodies, dead bodies smell
like sweet shit, sweet rotting meat.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a sweetness to it though.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really fricking weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sort of like sugar cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's almost, wow, that would be a
really weird, but attractive smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've smelled body odor smells in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a string called Hippie Slayer 33,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it smelled like straight BO,
but it smelled yummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I wanted to eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why would you want to eat human BO?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: The metal haze was pure cat piss.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just pissy pit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You would think if you opened a bag of
that, anyone who walked in would think,
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoa, did the cat just pee in here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pure piss.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, strangely attractive and
compelling.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you still keep that metal haze cut?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I lost the metal haze cut to police
metal haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking police.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking pigs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They always get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that cut was really special.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to work with it a few times and it
reminded me of a, maybe a more in the
[SPEAKER_02]: structure of the NL Skunk One dominant
because it wasn't super, super,
[SPEAKER_02]: super like lanky haze, but it had a good
structure to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good bud structure and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was such a cool line, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the reason, one of the main reasons
I crossed it to the Iron Cindy was to
[SPEAKER_05]: preserve it to some extent because they're
very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that Skunk One or like five haze
combo that you can see in both of them.
Why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I did it to make the Iron Cindy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I combined the metal haze and the C-99
because the C-99 is like a little metal
[SPEAKER_05]: haze kind of a faster C-99 is really
unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it has a kind of a, it's like a
poor man's haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely a lot of hazy sativa qualities
to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all, but a surprising amount for a
eight or nine week plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that's why C-99 gained
such popularity because people want that
[SPEAKER_02]: type of high in the same kind of flowering
time they could get from some of these
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of the few lines other than
like High and Lonesome's Appalachia that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've found that really captured the
ability to capture a sativa in a short
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering time like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like C-99 is the only one I've ever
seen that did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I grabbed it up so fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, Oh my God, this is,
this is really like a fast sativa with
[SPEAKER_05]: some definite long longer sativa flowering
qualities.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the C-99.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think she's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially now that I found that buku
grapefruit mama.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I'm a sucker for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pineapple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pineapple one, man, that turpinoline
that, that, that what you would refer to
[SPEAKER_02]: as like cat pissy smell, but like mixed
with the pineapple makes the flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: translate so well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it actually tastes like pineapple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sharp, citrus pineapple, sharp citrus
pineapple, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would, it would, it would be so hard
for someone to intentionally make that
[SPEAKER_02]: again from scratch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is one of the most pineapple
things there are in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really, really is pineapple.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, especially with a little cure on
it, two weeks of a cure and you open the
[SPEAKER_05]: jar and it's like, damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one that I, I, I do miss a lot and
I've actually been trying to look for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think CSI Humboldt might've grabbed it
recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully that, that one's going to
come back in rotation soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you have a book coming out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can always get the pineapple.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what the ratios are,
the percentages of chance that she pops
[SPEAKER_05]: up, but I did find her within probably 15
females.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I found one and I've had friends of mine
that have found them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're not super hard to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, they're in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're probably one, we're probably one
in eight, maybe one in 12, something like
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if, if, if people are interested,
do you still carry that line in seed form
[SPEAKER_02]: and sell it on your site?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you still preserve the C99?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's still like the F5s that I have
made.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what happened was last time I made
them, I made a shitload and I put most of
[SPEAKER_05]: them in deep freeze cryo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I just tap.
[SPEAKER_05]: From a smaller source.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once they run out, I bust into the deep
freeze cryo, bring a bunch out and do it
[SPEAKER_05]: again.
[SPEAKER_05]: That way it can stay the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have to keep inbreeding them and
inbreeding them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't have to keep yanking them in
and out of the cryo constantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time you want to take out a pack and
fluctuate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love a couple of the phenols,
but the pineapple beast is my favorite and
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll always want to be able to get her.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't want to risk it on the off
chance that, cause sometimes it's like
[SPEAKER_05]: with the skunk man, sometimes it's just
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mother nature just goes, ha ha ha ha.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just nothing you could do.
[SPEAKER_05]: You try to combine what you think is going
to work in a certain way and it comes out
[SPEAKER_05]: almost opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now twice now I've combined roadkill skunk
male with roadkill skunk female.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get all the same spread that I would
have if I would have pretty much crossed
[SPEAKER_05]: anything, any other two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it always comes out spreading
the spread.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't get to isolate it down.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I, what I just did recently for just
because that pisses me off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I took the Vietnam black jungle sativa
since I had the male flowering,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had a roadkill skunk candy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was only a little clone, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a little clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I popped it in the flowering tent,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I made a flower and it only ended up about
this big, but it got pollinated with that
[SPEAKER_05]: gnarly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if you've never smelled the V black
before, let me tell you, it's it's not
[SPEAKER_05]: like anything else ever I've smelled in my
life.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's sort of like nag champa incense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's real sharp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's just god awful exotic and
delicious but I mean, so I crossed it with
[SPEAKER_05]: that, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a sharp acrid terp profile,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I brought the the roadkill skunk up
against it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm going to end up with a long
flowering son of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be 12 weeks at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I grow these out and I get a high
percentage of roadkill skunks,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can bet I'll be waiting him down to
shorter flowering and be able to keep that
[SPEAKER_05]: roadkill skunk because I'm sure that V
black will rule dominant in many of the
[SPEAKER_05]: things, especially the turf combo,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should be able to in theory,
inbrede these with the right combo and get
[SPEAKER_05]: all roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: They might be 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: They might be 10 weeks but I should be
able to do it because I can't I can't get
[SPEAKER_05]: my skunk line to come all roadkill.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just it won't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've tried three different ways and I
always get the same spread no matter what
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried two different ways with a few
different lines and it is very hard
[SPEAKER_02]: especially once the bud is dry to lock in
that smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the bud dries, it's like the smell is
gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes that is the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it just you know, it depends on
a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like what I do now more recently only
for the last, I don't know, three years,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe four years or so is I used to never
dry my weed too dry because I like to
[SPEAKER_05]: smoke it when it has just a skosh of
moisture still in it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's much much smoother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: You smoke super super dry weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little hot, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I always like my weed like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's hard to store weed like that
without consistently burping it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or else it loses the smells faster,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, what what I do now is, oh,
and this works good but I take and I
[SPEAKER_05]: mummify it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I dry it so **** bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: You touch it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll just crumble.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how dry I dry it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I very carefully put it in big jars and
put it in a big jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put it in the insulated cooler and I
store it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I want to hit that weed or check it
out or smoke it or whatever, I just open
[SPEAKER_05]: the jar up.
[SPEAKER_05]: My humidity around here is usually around
50% which is fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: 50, 60%.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I take some very carefully out of the
jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I set it in an open bowl, close the jar,
put it back, and then I let it just set
[SPEAKER_05]: out in my room for about a few hours
usually.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna check the moisture level because
fast, it'll start soaking that up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I bet.
That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Moisture from there, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it gets to that perfect
consistency within several hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it takes overnight.
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends if the humidity is low.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But uh but by the next day or within a few
hours, boom!
[SPEAKER_05]: You not only have the perfect moisture
level in your buds but the smells just
[SPEAKER_05]: come out with a vengeance then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It all starts processing again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you mummified it, you've stopped it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've stopped everything it's doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no moisture.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no moisture in there, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so it preserves your buds for a super
long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I take them all.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put them in all smaller containers like
like either pint jars or what are they
[SPEAKER_05]: quart jars?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I save them all in that so that I never
have to bust one open and keep opening it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that way, I can burn through one
in a relatively short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you have to keep opening it and close
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Having more moisture get in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That fluctuation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I opened up some Blue Crayon 1947 a few
days ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was five years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been in storage for five years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did that to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Five years and it wasn't frozen or
anything?
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Understand, I store them in a big,
gnarly, insulated cooler.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: This cooler is in a place that is pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never gets really warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the real key to the long-term storage
is having your degree variance be very
[SPEAKER_05]: small in any 24-hour period, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: You only want that to change like a degree
or two max.
[SPEAKER_05]: Max, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, that will store it as long as
it's cool for a super long time all by
[SPEAKER_05]: itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, mine stays like that in the cooler.
[SPEAKER_05]: Five years, buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Five years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I broke it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let the moisture absorb it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I squeezed it and went, mama.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who else has blown my mind is
Bodie.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has like this barn with buds hanging in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for years, he can have buds in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just of all different land race and
stuff, he's going to pick it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because Santa Cruz's humidity is so
perfect, it's just like a humidor for Bud
[SPEAKER_02]: in last years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you've got like here,
it's really a lot of times here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too wet to really, I mean,
I can pop them in the room since I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: trim the plant at harvest now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just take the whole plant, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the big leaves will come down and
protect most of the buds from the light.
[SPEAKER_05]: But sometimes, man, I just have to hang
them in the grow room to let them dry,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're not in any direct light.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a lot of reflected light,
which is not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I sometimes have to do it because my
humidity is 90% plus for a week.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and I can't dry anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I put it in the jars, I'll be mold city
fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: My girl who I have, I have Kaifon this
tool of hers.
[SPEAKER_05]: She had a dehydrator, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right when I pull them down, I take them
all in little buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I stack them all in that dehydrator.
[SPEAKER_05]: I let that fucker roll for about an hour
to get them mummy dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very carefully put them in the jars and
put them away.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that works like a champ.
[SPEAKER_05]: But during the summer, I don't need it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can mummy dry them just hanging them out
in the closet, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a new book coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the TLO version one and two,
correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this the V3 or is this a whole new
book?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whole new book.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've leaned away from the whole teas
thing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like teas anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I like is a perpetual tea.
[SPEAKER_05]: I call it the churn, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a constant addition to your water
that you back off when it's near harvest.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if the whole book will
explain it but it is the fucking bomb,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I keep, I adjust my water and
uh I give in the new book, there's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, probably ten soil recipes
for any situation no matter what you can
[SPEAKER_05]: get and what you can't get with tons of
options for what you can sub in.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a point of problem for some
people where they would not be able to get
[SPEAKER_05]: something in the original recipes and they
would sub in something else that's not
[SPEAKER_05]: good, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or or they would just leave it out
completely and with some things you can
[SPEAKER_05]: leave out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, with other things, that's not the
case, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, what else do we got?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all these new soil recipes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the new dynamics around growing
in general.
[SPEAKER_05]: It shows new micro pond style,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is essentially using the catch trays
as little micro ponds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where the water sits in for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have some stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have alfalfa and whatnot in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the micro life grows and then gets
sucked back into the plant and everything
[SPEAKER_05]: is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: That method works like unbelievably good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's so kick ass, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, it's like top dressing but it's
bottom but it's like top dressing that
[SPEAKER_05]: works much faster, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you get results within within
days, you can see the effects of what
[SPEAKER_05]: you've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a new component to the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else are you adding in?
[SPEAKER_02]: What else are we covering?
What else are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got so many new things about lighting
and sprouting and vegging and some
[SPEAKER_05]: detailed information about the lighting
and photo periods like you said.
[SPEAKER_05]: How to do sprouts, clones, uh all keeping
with the TLO methodology, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have I have an extensive troubleshooting
section that I believe will handle any
[SPEAKER_05]: freaking problem anybody can have.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I've seen with the first two
books.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen a lot of specific issues people
have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that it's their own fault.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's usually because of they can't source
something, you know, along those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, or they use something that's not
what I said to use like a couple of people
[SPEAKER_05]: have really bone themselves using kelp
extract to mix with their soil mix instead
[SPEAKER_05]: of kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yeah, that will do it and that's a
synthetic process to make the extract,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: With the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kelp extract is it's all it's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just highly concentrated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, obviously.
[SPEAKER_05]: Highly concentrated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: You start adding four cups of that to your
soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Potassium overdose is one of the ugliest,
most horrible ways to lose your plants
[SPEAKER_05]: because.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is an ugly, ugly death.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now, I know people are going to kick my
ass if I don't ask you about your roadkill
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned it briefly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did you source it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you describe it a little bit?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Long ago in Northern California,
I made lots of friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I went to the what was the cup?
[SPEAKER_05]: The Emerald Cup in 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a hold of an old friend of mine in
Willets that I knew had the skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew he was a gatekeeper of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he was, you know, paranoid,
skeptical.
[SPEAKER_05]: He kept calling me worldwide rev.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he just didn't dig the fact that
I was so out of hiding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so there was that aspect.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, anyway, I worked on him for a while,
about six months, and we finally made a
[SPEAKER_05]: deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would trade him some of my Mohawk for
some of his skunk, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we finally got together and he finally
did and he assured me that he hadn't
[SPEAKER_05]: bastardized it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was the original skunk line,
which I remember when it was first,
[SPEAKER_05]: before it was skunk, it was called Red
Russian, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Russian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it was before everybody
realized how skunky it was and the rest is
[SPEAKER_05]: history.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there a Russian River up there in
NorCal?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's where that's part of the why
it was named that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was probably right off the
Russian River and and it was very red.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so anyway, so it's always had from
seeds from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always had kind of a spread.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always some sweeter, some more
like body odor, stinky feet ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's like really skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's roadkill skunky ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's pissier ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's even some with a little bit of a
sweet component to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although those are very rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this plant, I've I've I've grown some
of these out several times now and I get I
[SPEAKER_05]: get a nice spread.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get roadkill pretty often.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say one in eight maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But but I don't have enough of a numbers
of those spread to really say that for
[SPEAKER_05]: sure yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, to make it I've gotten it about one
in eight so far from three runs,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the roadkills, the problem with the
skunk is that there's no way to tell it's
[SPEAKER_05]: roadkill until two weeks before harvest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know of no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's no indicator.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing else.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the turpents stay, stay changing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm gonna have to plug this in.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's alright.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm running a low battery.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hang on.
Alright.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll keep it going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see if I can do this and not screw
things up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm a techno wizard.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got this handle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, baby.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's my audio?
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes when you plug it in,
the audio goes to hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's talk about the morphology of
this skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it a pure Afghani?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it a hybrid?
[SPEAKER_02]: What what did you see from it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard three what I consider to be
legit stories for people I consider to be
[SPEAKER_05]: trustworthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm not really sure what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I the one consistency that I have heard a
lot is that it was a South American cross
[SPEAKER_05]: to the original Indica that came to
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was that kind remember with the
leafy florets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was that was all over suddenly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody had it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That was and it was real purple and real
gnarly but uh somebody now, the best I
[SPEAKER_05]: know is that was crossed with a South
American.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what that's what originally brought
the skunk line which was when it was when
[SPEAKER_05]: it was red Russian, it was and even skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very resistant to things like mold
and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't have a problem with any of that
stuff and uh as it now that it's an IBL,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, thirteen or fifteen or
twenty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, it's got some of those standard
weaknesses to go with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not so not so resistant to everything
anymore but it's still pretty much the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant I remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, granted, that was a long
time ago and I am Mr. Magoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But from what I remember, it, I would,
my best, my best estimate and feeling is
[SPEAKER_05]: that he did give me the true one that he
has inbred himself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like I said, the skunk has a thing
where it just won't, it won't go where you
[SPEAKER_05]: think it will go when you breed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It won't.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll just do it standard.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll just whip out bandwidths of the
different turps, the different
[SPEAKER_05]: morphologies, you know, all of the
morphologies are pretty close.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Turps are, turps are wide ranging,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: The two killers are the body odor,
stinky feet, and the skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are soup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, there's another one that I remember
that is also in these, a piney one,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: People love pine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super pine resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, really sharp.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But pine resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are probably the most potent in the
bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you, do you notice any intersex traits
specifically in that line or any of the
[SPEAKER_02]: skunky stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever notice that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, for example?
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the, the, the lines that we're
seeing that have a lot of the skunky
[SPEAKER_02]: traits, whether it's me or CSI,
we've been doing a lot of skunk stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost all of them are fricking full
intersex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time we run into that same terpene
profile, a lot of the times it comes with
[SPEAKER_02]: intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heavy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, I'm not sure I understand what
you mean by intersex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like herming, herming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, oh, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no, there's no, there's,
my skunk is sexually healthy, but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: good to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would not surprise me because when
the skunk came out, of course you had to
[SPEAKER_05]: have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everybody had it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And while I was associated with some
pretty damn decent breeders who were
[SPEAKER_05]: teaching me stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't the same for everyone,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so everybody and their mom was
breeding it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it just, everybody did.
[SPEAKER_05]: So tons of it, tons of the seeds of skunk
flood the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, you've got people who just,
they just can't seem to put in the work it
[SPEAKER_05]: takes to make sure that you're not blowing
hermies or, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Testing the lines, seeing what you've
made, any of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lost art.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do the most deep inspection on unknown
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I have anything that I don't,
that I'm not already totally familiar
[SPEAKER_05]: with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'm in there with my 30 times super
light magnifying glass every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm looking close.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm seeing, because I can recognize when
hermies are about to happen right before
[SPEAKER_05]: they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a little mutant growth
that occurs down at the axial intersex.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see it's like a mutant growth,
a mutant leaf growth kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's not, it's different than how a
female typically grows when you can see
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of like it's trying to revege a
little.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the viewers watching this,
I want, I want people to take note because
[SPEAKER_02]: I often talk about like different things
you learn only through experience and
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of those, if you'll notice when,
when I'm sitting here talking with my
[SPEAKER_02]: friend, the rep, he's talking about,
you know, I know this line because I know
[SPEAKER_02]: the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what I can see from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, for someone who isn't super
experienced running a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_02]: lines, not only a bunch of different
lines, but a bunch of the different
[SPEAKER_02]: baseline.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's meaning you're like skunk one,
haze, a lot of these land races,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's hard to truly understand until you've
run them, what it is when you can truly
[SPEAKER_02]: start predicting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what breeding is.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're able to predict, you know,
uh, to, to run your lines and then to see
[SPEAKER_02]: it in action and to realize, okay,
I was either right or wrong at this and
[SPEAKER_02]: make the next move.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all, that's all breeding is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and when you get to this point in
your career, when you've been breeding 40,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 30 years, a lot of this stuff
comes secondhand and a lot of it becomes a
[SPEAKER_02]: natural instinct as you're going through
these, these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, there's even stuff you're
telling me about different traits of the,
[SPEAKER_02]: of the leaf hairs on the cotyledons and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have never even thought of, and I spend
all of my time looking at the plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just constantly observing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how you learn is constantly
observing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to just let your plants,
you know, leave them in a room,
[SPEAKER_02]: let it auto run for a week or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're really into it, learn your
plants at every fricking stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, Rev's a great example of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything you've been saying about that
just reinforces that a hundred percent.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like when I was telling you about
my little hash trick earlier, it's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you are a breeder who doesn't really
know your shit yet, and you're dealing
[SPEAKER_05]: with lines that you're not really familiar
with yet, the easiest way to do it is to
[SPEAKER_05]: pick, let's say four of the strongest,
best, vigorous females, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grab a couple of the strongest,
biggest, best males, throw them all in and
[SPEAKER_05]: let them breed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, when they're about two weeks from
finishing, just go over them all with a
[SPEAKER_05]: magnifying glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: See who has the most resin, get a grip on
them, smell them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll know the smells by then,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything will be less because they'll be
full of seeds, but you can take that into
[SPEAKER_05]: consideration.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then go in and check them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you get a really good idea of what
you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's better than who, who's likely to be
the king, who sucks, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you just recycle plants that suck or
make hash or do whatever you want,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always make hash from those plants that
turn out good that I don't know anything
[SPEAKER_05]: about, but they're killer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I make hash from them so that I can
further dissect the exact resin profile
[SPEAKER_05]: relating to the high type itself,
which is what I cherish over everything
[SPEAKER_05]: else because some we just, it makes me
aggro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trainwreck can do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's different hash plants that can do
that for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: The really super fast flowering plants,
the ones that flower in like six or seven
[SPEAKER_05]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those all have the exact same quality for
me of what I call aggro weed, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like I smoke them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get really high, really baked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all, well, it doesn't last long.
[SPEAKER_05]: It only lasts like an hour or something,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you come out of it and then I'm like,
fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just am in a grumpy mood.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate those super fast flowering ones,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think maybe it just hasn't had
enough time for the resin glands to mature
[SPEAKER_02]: in different oils, obviously because
they're Afghanis, they'll have different
[SPEAKER_02]: oils than these longer flowering sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's what has something to do with
the high, just not enough time?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, certainly it has to do with the type
of high, generally speaking.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have that to high I just described,
that super up, super fast, really fucked
[SPEAKER_05]: up, and then you're down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That high just bugs me, but on a longer
flowering sativas, you have much more
[SPEAKER_05]: different kinds of highs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of them come across much different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some are very evil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some are very happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some are very, you can't read a book
because you have to keep rereading the
[SPEAKER_05]: first paragraph a hundred times.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some are just like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to get a grip on those smaller
assets of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You absolutely, I think it's impossible to
get a sativa 10 week plus high from
[SPEAKER_05]: anything that's below seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can believe you could do it in eight.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can believe that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The closest thing I've ever seen is a
Cindy, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so it would be rare, but yeah,
in order to get the kind of highs I really
[SPEAKER_05]: like and I really look for, it's gotta be
a 10 weeker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nine week, nine week exceptions I've seen
twice in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost every single breeder or someone I
would consider a connoisseur weed that has
[SPEAKER_02]: the experience has smoked a lot of
different strains and knows what they've
[SPEAKER_02]: been smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all tend to lean to that 10 to 11
week high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody seems to kind of, as we get
older, I think also our body's mature,
[SPEAKER_02]: the chemicals in our brains change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we all tend to just kind of
navigate to that certain kind of high type
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, really bizarre, but I've
noticed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really where the intersections meet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can go either way that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find anything you like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus at 10 weeks, you generally speaking,
almost always have much longer legs,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The legs will be much longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get that six, that V black I'm telling
you about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only does that take 20 minutes to set
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be 20 minutes before you're
like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before the ride truly starts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then you're going to stay exactly that
high.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no wobbling.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be like a freight train.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to go up slow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, man, you're not going to get off
of that for maybe five hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll cook you all day long.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of my favorites for going out on
bike rides or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that super long flowered sativa
tie, V black, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The metal haze was killer.
[SPEAKER_05]: The chunky cherry tie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's some of the current work you're
working on?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's some stuff you're really excited
about right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, I'm just kind of in a blurb
where I'm just bringing up some stuff to
[SPEAKER_05]: look at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just switched over my lights for winter,
so I'm all back to my iBlue 6500 Kelvin
[SPEAKER_05]: metal halide lamps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So once I get those in, I have to do a
little adjusting to my environment to make
[SPEAKER_05]: sure I can run everything right because
they're freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're freaking hot, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I run tents.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, anyway, I'm dialing that all in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, what I thought I would do is pop up a
few.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got right now just my ones to have a
look at right now that I have up are some
[SPEAKER_05]: Afghani Orange that's so old.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if it's a hybrid of Afghani
Orange or something else and I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_05]: who gave it to me but I had it in my
four-star can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's so old that the label wore off
and all I can read is Afghani Orange was
[SPEAKER_05]: part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I had to see what those were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they look they look cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: They look good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, the G13 Hayes,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I ended up, I planted like six.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still got two more seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I planted six.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got four to come up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two died.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, you know how they are with super,
super old seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just kind of came up and went,
no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other two which are a male
and a female and you know, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_05]: jinx my self or anything but they both
look really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm testing though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I just popped that G13 of flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you bet I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to be, I need to be looking at
that, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on the in the other tent,
I started up some Cherry Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some Cindy Black which with the scum.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so with so here's why because in my
head, if my Vietnam Black skunk doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: work out how I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'm going to try this Cindy Black
skunk and see if I can lock in those
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking skunk turbans because something
will do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something will do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have to find a gene that goes in
there and knocks them all cattywampus and
[SPEAKER_05]: gets them to line up more uniform for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A gene that somehow in one strain makes
that link trait to the skunk smell have
[SPEAKER_02]: something, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a link trait that's good with it and
brings it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something that locks it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something that'll just stick right to it
and make it so I can recognize when it's
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something visual, visual marker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Visual early on.
[SPEAKER_05]: A marker expression is what I call them
and that would be super nice to have
[SPEAKER_05]: because with the skunks at present,
the morphology is, you know, pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: random.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not, they don't have a wide range
but there's a lot different ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not an indicator.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing is locked to the roadkill and as
far as any patterns, leaf patterns,
[SPEAKER_05]: petiole patterns, root size, root density,
root, I cannot find anything that is only
[SPEAKER_05]: visible with the roadkill skunk,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm like, that pisses me off because
as much as I don't mind flowering some
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I am used to and I do like knowing
early, at least having a grip on what I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: dealing with, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it, I mean, as a breeder and as
someone who has goals in their breeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's like, that's the main part.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's never seen enough to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I have to take up ten, if I have to
flower ten females to find my,
[SPEAKER_05]: my roadkill skunk every time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's not how I do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the whole idea of becoming better
and getting to know what you're doing is
[SPEAKER_05]: to be able to take shark pets,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's the whole point of the
experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I mean, if you, if you don't know
anything about breeding, you can probably
[SPEAKER_05]: do really well if you're just willing to
do the work, flower all the plants first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: All sample them all and then bring have
saved clones and then just breed with
[SPEAKER_05]: those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll probably have learned more than
any, most other breeders out there in just
[SPEAKER_02]: that one experience by going through,
taking good notes, smoking everything and
[SPEAKER_02]: testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll, you'll be more advanced than 99%
of seed makers, I should say out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tell people a million times,
you know, you're going to start out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to seem like a lot of,
you know, you'd be taking a lot of notes,
[SPEAKER_05]: you'd be able to, but pretty soon you're
going to start to know a lot of things
[SPEAKER_05]: just intuitively from what you see,
you know, it's, you know, it becomes much
[SPEAKER_05]: easier, especially, like I said,
with mine that I'm familiar with,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I can tell when they're a month
old, a lot of things I need to know right
[SPEAKER_05]: then.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know which expressions are linked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know which markers I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know which markers equals something I
don't want, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a cool thing about keeping your
little Galapagos island of gene pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is because you've had all this
time to learn these specific strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: to learn how they breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I tell people to know your
breeder, this is what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be able to have a competent
conversation with your breeder about their
[SPEAKER_02]: lines, about the history of their lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they're passionate breeders,
if this is what they love, you should be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to have a conversation like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this has been an exceptional,
exceptional conversation with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else you want to get in
and plug or talk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pardon me now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else you want to get in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Before the end of the show and plug or...
Well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the new book, I should be able,
I should be submitting the manuscript
[SPEAKER_05]: around, I'm thinking first half of
December.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that should be able to put it in print
by the spring, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be super cool if you want to
get copy of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, with this book, I, you know,
in the first two books, one of the first
[SPEAKER_05]: things I start out by saying is this is
not a grow book.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not to teach you how to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: How to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is assuming you already know how to
grow weed and you want to grow it all
[SPEAKER_05]: naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to grow it better.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but now in this book, I was able to
not only organize it better.
[SPEAKER_05]: So after you read it, as you're growing,
you can go, wait a minute, what was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually find what you're looking
for because I've kept it all very isolated
[SPEAKER_05]: to chapters now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can go and look and reference it,
which is something the first two were
[SPEAKER_05]: lacking because, you know, I'm kind of a
bozo.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never written a book before.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's hard, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I can't even imagine where you start
and then you think it's going to be two,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the saddest part, the saddest part is
that the easiest part is actually writing
[SPEAKER_05]: the book.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the millions and millions of times
you have to go back through it and
[SPEAKER_05]: rewrite, recheck, update everything and
get, make sure everything's, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: you on track because with TLL,
I mean, I'm learning things, new things a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple of times a month.
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned, whoa, the new, you know,
cause I try new stuff all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're a pioneer of TLO.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, so, you know, I'll be in the book.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was halfway through the book and I
discovered something that was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's like that, huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: I go, Oh, so now I have to go through the
whole book, read it front to halfway and
[SPEAKER_05]: correct every reference I've made.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's relative to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And any spinoff references that are
relative to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it becomes a lot of tedious work,
but now it's, I'm in my favorite part now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this part.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the home run right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, this is where I'm just rolling
through it from front to back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm correcting punctuation, adding photos,
just making sure everything is,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, my paragraphs are good.
[SPEAKER_05]: My punctuation is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've said clearly what I want to say,
yada yada.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the fun times.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all fun work now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have to do all the formatting when
writing your books and like where the
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures go and formatting of the text and
everything, or does someone else do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I give a general format location.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a lot of times, you know,
when I'm talking about something and I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: showing a picture reference to it in the
manuscript, I note the photo at that
[SPEAKER_05]: point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so that they know I want it to
be somewhere real close to that statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so yeah, that works out good,
but they're, they're pretty good about
[SPEAKER_05]: just keeping it my way.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they, they try to work out
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I do is I, I give them like a bunch
of extra, like bud shots that are just,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any place for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just put them in an extra folder for
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I go, if you need to make space to,
you know, say, so my paragraphs are closer
[SPEAKER_05]: to my pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put in there, just use one of these bud
shots to even it all out, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so that works out good for both of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to green candy press.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they're my favorite cannabis
publisher.
[SPEAKER_02]: They publish your books.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did the strain cannabis indica and
cannabis sativa volumes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cannabis grow guide and they do a
lot of stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they've always, they've always
done me right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've always treated me right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've always done what they said.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they said they'd do it,
they do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I first got hooked up with them through
John over at skunk, you know, he was,
[SPEAKER_05]: he was buddies with Andrew over at green
candy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just hooked up with Andrew and I
couldn't be happier, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody who works there is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's a lot of, it's, it's good
working with those people, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met them through you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I worked with them in the
cannabis indica and sativa stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they were just so kind and
generous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I ever worked with the book
publisher, that's going to be the number
[SPEAKER_02]: one one I go through because it's just,
they're, they're great people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to give them a plug.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, like he knows that I would,
I've been struggling with trying to finish
[SPEAKER_05]: the book.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I just got my last hit from
COVID not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It spun me hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even get, I just got like flu
from the first one, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: But this one, man, this last one,
and it gave me kind of long COVID.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like extra fuzzy and sleepy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's cover, let's go over the,
the website before we're done kingdom,
[SPEAKER_02]: organicseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk about it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So something, when you go to kingdom
organic seeds, there's a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff there, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Read closely because you know,
I'm telling you the real deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, when you read this, take them
seriously, it's not just a bunch of shit
[SPEAKER_05]: I've written on there to make it sound
good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it's the real deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you get to the site, you'll notice
that up on the top bar, there'll be the
[SPEAKER_05]: strains, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all the strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, right next to that is a button
called gambler's section.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this section is where you can get
basically untested ish stuff that I know
[SPEAKER_05]: because I'm familiar with.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably going to work out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I've ever had a bad gambler
so far and there's been a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so you can get really good deals on
stuff before I really know what it's,
[SPEAKER_05]: what it's about.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, whether it's a full head or a
miss, but there's nothing bad on there and
[SPEAKER_05]: you can get some really good stuff on
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people just exclusively hunt that
zone to get stuff for a good deal before
[SPEAKER_05]: it comes in at the real price later down
the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure and check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the thing is a gambler's section,
the way you word it is going to be totally
[SPEAKER_02]: different from like a person getting their
clone, their first time crossing it,
[SPEAKER_02]: not testing it and releasing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are clones you've worked with for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a pretty good idea with these.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are ones I have high confidence are
going to be great.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have, like I said, I have,
I haven't thrown a dud into the gambler's
[SPEAKER_05]: section yet and I've thrown, I don't know,
30.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, are you going to venture into
feminized seeds at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't asked you that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I put this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell hell hell no, because feminized seeds
to me are sexually unhealthy genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's all it's about to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And besides them seeds are, are bad
because of their sexual health to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a breeder especially, but I'm not a big
fan of them anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: They grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably an unfair bias because it
was 15 or 20 years ago when I grew up and
[SPEAKER_05]: they sucked pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the one thing that I really don't like
and I have never liked are auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it's, you know why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because no matter what it is, all the ones
I've ever tried anyway, remember when I
[SPEAKER_05]: told you about those six or seven week
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flower six.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all have the same high type.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: All auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care if it's Thai auto flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It all has that exact same high to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just think those are a great option
for somebody who needs them and just needs
[SPEAKER_05]: to grow a little weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could totally see it, but as a breeder
or connoisseur, I poo poo those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I remember Neville said the
same thing that he just couldn't do
[SPEAKER_02]: anything good with Ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything just turned into shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found this, I can, I don't want to
say shit because it would be offensive to
[SPEAKER_02]: the people whose stuff I used,
but it wasn't as good as the stuff I was
[SPEAKER_02]: able to do with regular photo period
lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is always subpar.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always just below what it should be.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, it reminds me of back about a
decade ago, there was a bunch of Sativa
[SPEAKER_05]: that was suddenly released from Sweden or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all Acapulco gold and all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a pack of that right away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I grew it and I thought, you know,
this stuff looks pretty legit to me,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's all watered down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoever made it either was hideous at
selecting, lazy at selecting, or just
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't care and just, yeah, flowered and
bred whatever they grew, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: without really ever looking at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you do it that way,
your resin production will go down because
[SPEAKER_05]: you'll be selecting for the strongest best
plants and the two don't really mix,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You still have a super vigorous,
wickedly beast-like plant that is also
[SPEAKER_05]: incredibly potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually they're the medium or,
you know, they're very vigorous and
[SPEAKER_05]: they're very, very potent, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that energy.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the other end of the scale,
I run across plants fairly often that are
[SPEAKER_05]: psycho potent, insane resin production,
but fuck, talk about hard to, they have
[SPEAKER_05]: problems with everything, just like with
anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have problems with people,
cows, dogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have, you have offspring that just
suck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just, they have problems,
you know, genetically, heart defects,
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrient defects, you know, just the same
with plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have individuals that just never make
the grade, but a lot of times,
[SPEAKER_05]: those ones that fuck them up are the same
ones that make them have massive resin
[SPEAKER_05]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Massive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's been an absolute pleasure
having you on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, you are one of the people I
looked up to when I got into this and I
[SPEAKER_02]: still look up to and learn from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an absolute privilege and a
pleasure to have you on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people will be begging to have you
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, do we have the name of your new
book coming out and where it will be
[SPEAKER_02]: available?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be True Living Organics.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be The Druid Guide.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Druid Guide.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It shows along with your basic stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, it teaches you how to grow in
a lot more ways than the last one did.
[SPEAKER_05]: It also shows very high order,
high connoisseur, high artisan value
[SPEAKER_05]: methods.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ones that you probably don't want to start
out trying to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: To jump right into.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The basic lessons I show you in the book,
it will come much easier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you said, to be a breeder isn't
nearly as hard as you think it's going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be reading about it, as when you actually
get down and start to do it, you can
[SPEAKER_05]: actually, you're like, oh, that,
but you look at it on paper, you're like,
[SPEAKER_05]: holy shit, I'll never be able to do this.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you just got to jump in and learn and
experience and screw up and keep screwing
[SPEAKER_02]: up because that's, a lot of breeding is
screw ups.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're not screwing up,
then you're not really breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not really doing real selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a lot of people can't handle that
they screw up, that they're human.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they blame the seeds or the light or,
you know, they'll blame something else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything but them, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen these emails for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where I, on the other hand, when I see
something fucked up, I go, all right,
[SPEAKER_05]: what have I done?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my instinct.
[SPEAKER_05]: What have I done?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different mindset.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you learn faster that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take responsibility.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to make mistakes,
take responsibility and go, how can I not
[SPEAKER_05]: make this mistake again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the lessons from the wise.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to learn faster and actually
learn stuff, that's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be scared to fuck up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be scared to fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take responsibility and learn how not to
fuck it up next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't cross the streams.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't cross the stream.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is advice from the rev.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you from all of us at the Breeder
Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we look forward to seeing you again
soon, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be happy to come on again,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been super fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks a lot for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Privilege and a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
Cheers.
