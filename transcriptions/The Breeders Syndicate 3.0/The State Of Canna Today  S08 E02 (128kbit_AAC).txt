[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_01]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_01]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie,
[SPEAKER_01]: Not-so-dog, Breeder and grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_01]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Not-so-dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to talk about the state
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to do this every now and then to
kind of update on what's going on,
[SPEAKER_01]: not only with the legal market,
but how that's affecting the traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: market, I believe is a proper term that
the youngins are using these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, let's kick it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not-so-dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about some of the legal things
going on today in cannabis and how it's
[SPEAKER_01]: affecting everything from your
perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I think it's affecting
everything, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there is a part of the
cannabis scene from extracts to seeds to
[SPEAKER_02]: flour or anything like that, that hasn't
been affected by it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, honestly, it's been primarily
negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you could say, especially for
California, because some of these other
[SPEAKER_02]: states, it might be their first time that
they got stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: But California has had medical shops and
stuff like that basically full-fledged
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now when you say negative,
who are we speaking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is it affecting negatively?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it affecting the consumer negatively
right this second?
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually think it's affecting everyone
negatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know that everyone will
realize the effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I don't know if you want to
start from the consumer and go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for a lot of consumers,
choice has gone down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quality has certainly dropped
significantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And price has gone up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But bro, I'm getting my cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you think price has gone up,
really, though?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, hasn't the price on the pounds
dropped?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is the legal market, has it gone up?
[SPEAKER_01]: For the consumer?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I said.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start with the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're buying eighths and ounces
or something like that, if you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: into shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they paying the same price or more?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're paying more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm just so out of the loop on that
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're paying more because when you
go and there's all these built-in taxes
[SPEAKER_02]: that there didn't used to be before all
the laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's excise taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's these taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all these different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people sometimes on IG will post
these receipts and they'll show like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, I just bought $3.70 eighths.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you add up the taxes and the
excise and the this and that and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else, plus the sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like this crazy component of it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I also think, too, that like all
these mylars that most what I mean by
[SPEAKER_02]: mylar for people listening, I think most
people know, but like a lot of a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis these days is sold in opaque
mylar bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which means that you're looking at it and
you get to see what the strain name is and
[SPEAKER_02]: you get to see what the packaging and the
art they chose is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But very often you don't even get to see
the cannabis you're buying until you've
[SPEAKER_02]: left the building.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely not smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't get to smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get to touch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get to view it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's sort of like, you know,
you just get to see the art and the things
[SPEAKER_02]: that they've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's some exceptions.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people that are, you know,
there's there's some things where they're
[SPEAKER_02]: visible.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some people that are selling them
in jars and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, you don't get to
see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think the taxes have made it to
where I would bet on average people are
[SPEAKER_02]: paying more at the shop than they are than
they were under 215.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, I would bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I don't think the choices
are as as, you know, as diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wonder if if they won, if they
care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess as long as the prices are high,
they probably do care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the more prices drop on the
consumer end, the less they would care
[SPEAKER_01]: because the prices are lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know know that they've been
taught quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's it's I mean, you know,
you can say that people wouldn't care,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but it's like I mean,
I guess you could walk like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you use an alcohol perspective,
you could walk into the store and be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I am glad that the Bud Light is getting
cheaper by the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wish that there was maybe some other
brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so I, you know, I think what
happened is personally is I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: when they made these rules, they looked at
like what the black market price or the
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional market price or the medical
price or whatever you want, whatever you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to phrase it as was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they based a bunch of taxes and fees
off of that price.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not realizing that as soon as you expanded
supply by a ton, you were going to change
[SPEAKER_02]: the pricing of all that dramatically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So taxes are too high for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taxes are too high for the distro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taxes are too high for the, you know,
for the for the farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think that I don't I don't
think yet that the states care.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because what's really happening
is, is they get so many taxes and they get
[SPEAKER_02]: so much fees up front, especially like
municipalities and counties and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they get so many they get so much up
front just for the right to do it that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not like normal taxes should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making money off when you make a sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not having to pay up front for all the
ability to surveil you and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like you start adding in all these
you start adding in all these fees and
[SPEAKER_02]: taxes and revenue boosters into a new
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it's basically done is it's made
quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's made quality a lot harder to come by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seeing stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably are, too, Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seeing stories like in California of
just like how many cultivation licenses
[SPEAKER_02]: are not being renewed for the 2023 season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's got to scare them a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they may not have have seen the
effect immediately again because they were
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the money from, you know,
the the the right to be able to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the licenses and all that shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look at it in a different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think I'm not a very big fan of
Proposition 64 for California
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to get too California
specific because I'm sure there's a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of people in other states that like have
different rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things that happened is,
you know, when we all voted on this thing
[SPEAKER_02]: that we were supposed to they were
supposed to for the first five years,
[SPEAKER_02]: you weren't supposed to grow more than an
acre or say forty three thousand five
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred square feet for the first from
2018 to 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was supposed to allow legacy
farmers a toehold to have them have years
[SPEAKER_02]: to establish distro and dispensary and all
these different relationships before big
[SPEAKER_02]: companies came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Steve D'Angelo and a harbor side and
other lobbying groups, they didn't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: wait that long.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to dominate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they got to work around where you
couldn't have more than an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's still true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because that's part of the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can stack as many ten thousand
square foot licenses as your county will
[SPEAKER_02]: allow you or your city will allow you to.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what happened there is that what
they would have found, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_02]: if they would have forced it to just be an
acre or less, you would have had all these
[SPEAKER_02]: legacy brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you would have discovered that with
the amount of stores that they have,
[SPEAKER_02]: the legacy brands were more than capable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of filling the current demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since all these legacy brands would
have been a lot more a lot smaller and a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot more diverse in size, their quality
probably would have been a lot better
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting the shelves.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what they did is they allowed certain
counties like in Monterey and Salinas and
[SPEAKER_02]: in Santa Barbara and different areas to
blow up and have dozens or hundreds even
[SPEAKER_02]: of light of ten thousand square foot
licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got, you know, and when you look
at it, when you look at the fees for some
[SPEAKER_02]: of these things, some of these some of
these farms are paying hundreds of
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of dollars to over a million
dollars a year just in just in license
[SPEAKER_02]: fees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the state and the county is going to
get all that money up front.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's way, way too much weed
being produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a quick question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tangent, but quick question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is Harborside producing all that stuff
in Arizona for so long that everybody knew
[SPEAKER_01]: about?
[SPEAKER_01]: That I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there some way they were moving it in?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, they as far as I know,
Harborside had a pretty, I think it was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, 10 or 11 acres or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a pretty big greenhouse facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, publicly known, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere somewhere in Salinas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, maybe not about the Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember the Arizona stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, but I don't I don't have any inside
information on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, there's basically what what
happened is, is there was any number of
[SPEAKER_02]: rich people and their children,
especially who were like, oh, this is a
[SPEAKER_02]: new massively profitable industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to help my family dominate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And kind of what's happened, this is
actually maybe this is like a little
[SPEAKER_02]: subversive for me to say or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but really what's happened is most of
the biggest investors in the biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: companies have just been lighting a bunch
of money on fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they thought they were going to burn
through all this money.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, they would have
a dominant market position.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they would recoup that over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a poor person, I look at that and I
think, oh, those rich people thought they
[SPEAKER_01]: were rich enough to play with the richer
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the other way you could look at it,
and I'm not, you know, I'm not I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: names or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you could say that there was a
industry wide thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't take offense if you're one of
these people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe you should.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends on who you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when the money first came into
cannabis, a lot of traditional cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: people who had had to hide for a long time
and stay low and they didn't really deal
[SPEAKER_02]: with that type of sharky rich person
stayed low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the people that were really
interested in rap and getting rich and
[SPEAKER_02]: being flashy, they were the first people
to run towards the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what happened is, is a lot of money
made a lot of bad deals with a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people that weren't able to actually do
what they said they were going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was a bunch of people that acted
like they were connected and knew some
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, but weren't and didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean that we saw that nonstop in every
single facility we've ever been to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of it when people would hire
us to consult, it would be to fix the
[SPEAKER_01]: errors of the knuckleheads that came
before us, the chads that came for us that
[SPEAKER_00]: were like, yeah, we know what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you saw so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, you have a situation now
where it's like a state of the union or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, but you won't like if you're on
IG or you follow like marijuana news or
[SPEAKER_02]: anything like that, you're seeing reports
all the time of now of like almost daily
[SPEAKER_02]: or weekly of pissed off investors who all
their all their investment money has been
[SPEAKER_02]: blown and they're wondering what the
hell's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like in my neck of the woods,
I mean, it was this big thing where like
[SPEAKER_02]: Flo Khanna, you know, they raised two
hundred and fifty million dollars or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a few months ago, they shuttered
operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think those guys, you know,
they dealt with some pretty sharky
[SPEAKER_02]: investors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, who were probably not the
greatest people to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the investors are like,
OK, well, we're going to kick you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take it all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're like here like,
oh, what are we taking over?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and what it turns out is,
is that as long as we're going to be this
[SPEAKER_02]: situation where we're not federally legal
and we're only state legal, then every
[SPEAKER_02]: state technically, legally is supposed to
be its own little island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which means that it can only you can't
outs you can't send your excess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywhere but these highly regulated
channels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nobody ever figured out like how much
output or how to like how to give out the
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, how to give out licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since licenses had a ton of upfront
money and fees and costs involved,
[SPEAKER_02]: they just granted them and took a bunch of
the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they made it really, really hard for
most of these places to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you have is you have the people
that are best at growing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: say like the people in my area and Mendo
or, you know, southern people that have
[SPEAKER_02]: been growing for a long time outdoor or
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you have people that are really quality
indoor farmers or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're pushed in all these different
directions just to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can't actually bring their full
craft knowledge to bear because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: having to make choices based on surviving.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you've got these huge companies
that are just burning through other
[SPEAKER_02]: people's money that are producing B and C
grade cannabis and then dumping that
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere they can just to stay afloat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how much do you think the hemp market
played into it?
[SPEAKER_01]: The hemp market?
[SPEAKER_01]: The hemp market played into the THC market
and the overflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, I mean, I think that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, really, I mean, like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the state of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before we get into hemp, I'll just say
this, what happened is, is that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: way too much cannabis being grown in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, way too much, way too much outdoor,
way too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's there's so many 300, 500,
800 lighters, you know, all these huge
[SPEAKER_02]: scenes that are banging stuff out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's and what's weird is that like
you look at Canada and Canada every year
[SPEAKER_02]: destroys large amounts of unsold legal
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far in America, all of ours just
disappears.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just disappear.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens is, is that there's not
enough demand to, you know, to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's way more supply than
there is demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: The state doesn't want to admit failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, there's a lot of let's
just say that the line between the legal
[SPEAKER_02]: market and the traditional market is more
of a it's more of a shadow than a line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd say very permeable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got we had a brief technical
difficulty, but wherever I was talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about the line between legal and
traditional is more of a is more of a
[SPEAKER_02]: shadow than a firm line.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so no one wants the state
doesn't want to address the fact that they
[SPEAKER_02]: weigh allowed overproduction to
proliferate, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what happens is, is that a lot of
this stuff is getting diverted.
[SPEAKER_01]: But diverted, diverted into the
traditional market, diverted into the
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional market is flooding that in and
taking out what would be future potential
[SPEAKER_01]: competitors for rich folk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that leads to annoy
me is like when I'd smoke weed with
[SPEAKER_02]: friends on the dab revolution,
was happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, you know, this this torch thing
is really not relaxing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just took a really nice hit,
you know, and I'm like, oh, happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's all it was too it was too
tweaky for me because I remember back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the day, like tweakers used to have to
make their own pipes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do that with blow torches and
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used to hate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it would just be the nasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I would see people like light up
dab rigs, it would just bring back bad
[SPEAKER_01]: memories of that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, when we just start
bullshitting about nothing in particular,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's come coming through crystal clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I start trying to chat and then
we like lose it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's that's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's go ahead and keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know exactly where we got cut
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I what I think is happening is I think
that the state doesn't want to admit that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's allowed far too much production to
occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's nowhere for that production to
go within the regulated channels or not
[SPEAKER_02]: enough of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't really know how to have a
system where people have poured in all
[SPEAKER_02]: this money, probably without getting sued
of how to pick and choose winners and
[SPEAKER_02]: losers of who can continue and who can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they probably don't want to admit that
they created a system that's failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's happened is, is because we're
not allowed to do interstate commerce,
[SPEAKER_02]: our overproduction isn't allowed to go
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legally, that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happened, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, from just from my point of view,
the way I look at it and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this really like super nihilistic
point of view on everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very dark, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I thought that was like,
from my point of view, all done
[SPEAKER_01]: intentionally with the knowledge,
like that they it's very easy for them to
[SPEAKER_01]: predict how to crash a market and how to
like how to sink because they can afford
[SPEAKER_01]: to lose money for X amount of years
because they're used to doing this
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: They as any any corporate entity,
these major corporate entities are buying
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, like a W.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the one that the UFC and all that
stuff they've got?
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got interest in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I don't believe I don't believe
that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I agree with you and that I had my
suspicions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do think that there are some people
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glasshouse that is is intending on burning
through investor money in the hopes that
[SPEAKER_02]: the market opens up and then their
position to service a much wider part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the American people than they currently
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, the way I'm saying it is is not
necessarily so mysterious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the idea is the richest people that
are going into a business in a new
[SPEAKER_01]: commodity, they know that they can outlast
taking losses longer than the other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I get what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: They drive the price down or they drive
the price up.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one can compete or drive it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one can compete because they can't
afford to sell at that price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they artificially because it was
artificially driven down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they control the whole market and
everybody's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: What they're discovering is is that too
many different disparate rich people were
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I was trying to get you
really ended up doing was lighting their
[SPEAKER_02]: money on fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got too greedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes some of these people like
are now tired and like they're you're so
[SPEAKER_02]: look at it from like a rich person's
perspective, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to put their money into
something that gives them a rate of
[SPEAKER_02]: return.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got bamboozled into thinking that
like weed was going to be this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, it's going to be three times
the size of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be an 80 billion dollar
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get into the ground floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: My son, who's kind of been a ne'er do well
his whole life, I'm going to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: like gift him at the ground level this
amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, he's going to stop being a
disappointment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I think I think a lot of
it may be that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think a lot of people predicted that
there was going to be a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so here's maybe we could maybe we
could take a different step back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because this explains a lot of it
where because it's because it's still
[SPEAKER_02]: federally legal, the feds have decided to
some degree where if as long as it's
[SPEAKER_02]: within a state, they're not really going
to apply it because the state is sovereign
[SPEAKER_02]: and can do what it wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, like I said, that makes each
state its own little island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes it unique in business because
there's almost nothing else in America
[SPEAKER_02]: where you're confined by whatever business
you're doing to the state that you're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fireworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe like maybe you need to get
like a law license or like a real estate
[SPEAKER_02]: license.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it comes to like goods,
for the most part, there's nothing where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like, oh, this good can't cross
state lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can only be in California or it can
only be in Wyoming or it can only be in
[SPEAKER_02]: Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fireworks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fireworks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So down to do it is you have to realize
that like rich people want a rate of
[SPEAKER_02]: return on their investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so far, cannabis has been a terrible
investment in which many, many,
[SPEAKER_02]: many big investors are not even getting
their principal back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much less profit on their principal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no rich people want to like light their
money on fire or like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: shoot it down a tube and never see it
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they got into it where they thought,
oh, I can get into this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get into this marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can be in at the ground floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get a big amount of market share and
we can get in early and I'm going to make
[SPEAKER_02]: gads of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where like I keep saying like
they treated it like any commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it wasn't like any commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so unique and so different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not federally legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that what that means is that like
if it was federally legal, we could ship
[SPEAKER_02]: it to whatever other states we wanted to
that wanted to allow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we could send our excess to
places, which means every single state
[SPEAKER_02]: that's setting that's gotten set up has
gotten new investors jumping in,
[SPEAKER_02]: hoping to make a bunch of money before
there's competition for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all bumping into the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was talking about it before with
Flocon or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you really think those people wanted to
light two hundred and fifty million on
[SPEAKER_02]: fire?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can't imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after you pour that amount of money
in, you decide to stop touching cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and you shutter most of the operations as
you try to retool and figure out what you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's not a good look.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see that thing like it was on it
was on IG and it was in the news,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, where there's investors that are
hella angry at Emerald.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's Emerald Family Farms from
from Humboldt, where they got an 18 or a
[SPEAKER_02]: 19 million dollar reinvestment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy absconded and changed his
number and the investors haven't received
[SPEAKER_02]: a penny of their principal back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shocking.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You went crypto with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just well, you know, I'm not there's
like not like I don't I don't know any
[SPEAKER_02]: details of it either, but there's
investors.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's investors that are now suing
various executives of cookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, angry, angry at, you know,
all kinds of various practices,
[SPEAKER_01]: but probably I saw that I saw that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what was the one that they were
saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're basically saying that they
got diluted and that certain executives,
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple of them were pretty famous.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting kickbacks, side deals and
all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, like if you're running on
investor money, they don't want you making
[SPEAKER_02]: side deals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because it's all, you know,
public and yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not your money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't be doing that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so and so who knows if it's true or
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've entered in like, yeah,
that's not what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't have any inside information on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'm saying is, is that,
you know, you can look around at these
[SPEAKER_02]: stories that are coming out, whether it's
Flo Conner, Emerald Family Farms or
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies or whatever, where people that
were investing a bunch of money in 2018,
[SPEAKER_02]: 2019, 2020 with big hopes and dreams of
having a bunch of market share and and
[SPEAKER_02]: making a lot of money off their investment
are now worried that they're not even
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get their investment money back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much less profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they thought they were going to come
in swinging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they thought they were going to take
it over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the things I was trying to
say before we had some technical glitches
[SPEAKER_02]: is that because it's still federally
illegal, you know, most big banks are
[SPEAKER_02]: multinational banks, you know,
or they operate and they don't want big
[SPEAKER_02]: fines and they don't want trouble with the
federal government.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which means so far that cannabis
businesses have been they've had cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses actually have a really hard
time even getting banking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can I can throw something in
here that's very recent that I learned
[SPEAKER_01]: with seed banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, there is Attitude Seed Bank
opened up in the USA.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people know about this and they
were able to secure credit card
[SPEAKER_01]: processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, their competitors were trying to
do the same thing and they were told major
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even a consistent problem.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, typically what happens,
too, is, you know, like a bank will find
[SPEAKER_02]: out that a cannabis company is a cannabis
company because they're not all named like
[SPEAKER_02]: Emerald Emerald Farms or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are named like the most
benign sounding LLC imaginable T-shirts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in order to get around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they literally shut you down
because they don't want fines from the
[SPEAKER_02]: federal government.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want because they're federally
insured.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want any trouble from the
federal government because they're trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to stay compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what that means is that they're very
intent upon not having a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional cannabis black market money
flow in to the legal system.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted it to be above board and they
wanted to be legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is, is that we don't have
really government banks in this country.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these banks are private, which means
that like the government can't have
[SPEAKER_02]: California or whoever can't order the bank
to treat this industry like a normal
[SPEAKER_02]: business if it sees liability for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you and I can't go into a into a bank
with a business idea and a prospectus and
[SPEAKER_02]: a, you know, and get a loan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't go to AG credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't go to Chase or, or Wells Fargo
or, you know, Jay, you know, any of these
[SPEAKER_02]: big companies, you can't go to them and do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they want you to use banked money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that you're dealing with
private individuals, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: or funds that collect rich people's banked
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means that that's why I always go
back to no matter if, no matter what,
[SPEAKER_01]: those people were never going to win
because they were never rich enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: compete with the William Morris company
and all these other major organizations.
[SPEAKER_02]: These major organizations, they haven't
even really jumped in all that much yet
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's not like they want to jump in
when it's when like, I honestly think that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can look around at some of these big
companies like, you know, whatever cookies
[SPEAKER_02]: or jungle boards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or somebody like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're hoping when they go federally
legal, I would guess that some big
[SPEAKER_02]: corporation like Nabisco or William Morris
or, you know, absolute, some big company
[SPEAKER_02]: comes in and just buys them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they're hoping for because
honestly, so far the super large companies
[SPEAKER_02]: that can really throw their weight around
cannabis is too small fry for them yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not international.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's too many barriers to trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's too many regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's too many restrictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too new.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to throw math.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might be prepping for what's
eventually going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we already know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know that they would buy in
under their names.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always buy in under subsidiaries
anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't really have a very good idea
of who's buying into what because they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't ever do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I buy in as their name, you know,
so far they're also smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what it looks like is that a bunch of
the private investors so far looks like
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to lose their ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, heavily.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to heavily lose their ass.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so they might be waiting for
like it to actually go more legal and then
[SPEAKER_02]: they can come in and buy things for
pennies that have a lot of infrastructure
[SPEAKER_02]: in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think some of these big people call
them MSOs, multi-state organizations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of these MSOs, both the
executives and the private investors that
[SPEAKER_02]: are involved in them, their whole business
model is to get big enough and attractive
[SPEAKER_02]: enough that someone eventually comes along
and gobbles them up and everybody makes a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of money based on their stock
position.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that that's that's the idea
of like a lot of like how I shouldn't say
[SPEAKER_01]: the average person when they start a
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the mindset is that they
hope they get big enough to get bought out
[SPEAKER_01]: by someone bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a lot of the small business
mindset.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't have the mindset of
a long game.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, it so.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I think that's the
investors, you know, they're looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: that's how they're going to get paid back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this big buyout and everybody gets a
certain amount per share.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it comes in a big chunk,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so some of these investors,
some of these businesses are always after
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh batches of private investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like the most devastating thing for
them ever would be the status quo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminds me of the Internet bubble so
much, just just the way we're speaking
[SPEAKER_01]: about it, like the the the Internet bubble
of the the two thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this thing where it's like,
oh, Yahoo's worth four hundred and eighty,
[SPEAKER_02]: four hundred and eighty bucks a share.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eventually somebody goes,
well, how do they actually make money?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone's like, where's all the money?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is the revenue?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it's like you can have
certain businesses, strangely enough,
[SPEAKER_02]: for market share that keep losing money,
but gaining market share.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, Amazon would be the
primary example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where they grew themselves with losses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were actually gobbling up market
share and destroying local malls and
[SPEAKER_02]: changing how consumers shopped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they changed how business was done
in that in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They changed how they changed literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Internet came along with them and
people could all of a sudden shop in their
[SPEAKER_02]: underwear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so that model can't that
model can work, you know, but it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: working for weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think now you're in this position
where we're in California, we're five
[SPEAKER_02]: years into legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden, the stuff you start
to see a lot of is anger and lawsuits and
[SPEAKER_02]: recriminations and firing of executives
and all these different things going on,
[SPEAKER_02]: because where's the money?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's making money?
[SPEAKER_02]: No one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing like when you when you talk to
people and you and I both talk to a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people all up and down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to call it the industry on both
sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, who tells you, you know,
you don't even know who they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is anyone telling you, oh, we're making
money hand over fist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't be happier.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like the only people that
could be making money are the is the taxes
[SPEAKER_01]: making money, which and I don't see that
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see like public social stuff
benefiting widely from taxes are making
[SPEAKER_02]: money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taxes are skimming off other people's
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the only guaranteed money that
has come in are the taxes, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: taxes and fees and all this different
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of times these investors were
promised whatever they needed to get
[SPEAKER_02]: promised so that these people could get
the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they figure it out later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's some of these people,
some of the people that are winning is
[SPEAKER_02]: like some of these executives that
borrowed that borrowed a bunch of money
[SPEAKER_01]: had that last test.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had enough technical difficulties
this week now that I do feel a little
[SPEAKER_02]: thrown off my my jibber jabber game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on top of all the legal stuff,
there was some news today that kind of hit
[SPEAKER_01]: the scene that that was a little wacky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the general consensus when I posted
the article was not not positive from our
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: The traditional market, I would say,
generally speaking, that responds to what
[SPEAKER_01]: I post.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was about California giving twenty
two million dollars, I believe it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: or there thereabouts to it was either six
or 16 universities to conduct research on
[SPEAKER_01]: legacy strings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the response from pretty much everyone
was resoundingly like, how?
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are they going to do legacy anything
when they haven't talked to anyone in the
[SPEAKER_01]: community?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know my I'm I'm super biased and
opinionated about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really interested since since you
hadn't heard about it or seen it yet to
[SPEAKER_01]: hear your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't you know, I didn't actually
hear about it because I was otherwise
[SPEAKER_02]: occupied today until you told me right
before we kind of started the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think, you know, it's a needed thing
in the sense that they should should start
[SPEAKER_02]: taking interest into the genetic history
and the diversity and the different types
[SPEAKER_02]: of plants that are out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their problem that they're going to face
probably is the same problem that they
[SPEAKER_02]: face like with making things legal is like
since we don't have any like accreditation
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's no way for them to like vet
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they choose who should be on the
board?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as you as you as I and I know,
right, like without naming any names and
[SPEAKER_02]: getting anybody mad at us or anything like
that, you know, there is a lot of popular
[SPEAKER_02]: people that actually aren't that in depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you start talking about like,
well, who should be the people talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about history?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my gosh, would you probably get a big
debate on who is allowed in and who people
[SPEAKER_02]: trust and who people don't trust?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, let me read this to you real quick so
you can get a better idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me getting close because I am blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: The California Department of Cannabis
control the DCC awarded 20 million in
[SPEAKER_01]: research grants to 16 academic
institutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The funds will support scientific research
on the impact of cannabis on the mental
[SPEAKER_01]: health of young people, novel cannabinoids
and Delta 8 and Delta 10 THC and a first
[SPEAKER_01]: of its kind study of California's legacy
cannabis genetics intended to preserve the
[SPEAKER_01]: history, value and diversity of the
communities that steward them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the department's aspiration that
these studies will advance the body of
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific research further our
understanding of cannabis and aid to the
[SPEAKER_01]: continued development and refinement of
the legal framework, said Rasha Salama,
[SPEAKER_01]: chief deputy director at DCC.
[SPEAKER_01]: These studies will provide valuable
insights on topics of interest to
[SPEAKER_01]: California's consumers, businesses and
policymakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the department looks forward to
sharing them once they are completed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Researchers at the University of
California, San Diego, will build on the
[SPEAKER_01]: existing federally funded project to
provide California specific data on the
[SPEAKER_01]: impact of cannabinoids on mental health,
physical health during adolescence,
[SPEAKER_01]: yada yada yada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was more interested in the.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the legacy part, but they don't really
go much more into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so after hearing more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything change there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, uh, it's about as vague as humanly
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for the fact that, um, you know,
they're going to look at effects on
[SPEAKER_02]: children.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and which makes 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that that makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because, um, you know, anytime you
make rules, there's obviously going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: a series of people that are going to try
to work their way around rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think they anticipated when
they passed the farm bill that had the
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp part to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That people were going to extract these
things, Delta eight, Delta 10,
[SPEAKER_02]: because they only had regulations banning
Delta nine THC.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta nine happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: A specific kind of Delta nine THC at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens is, is, is various
entrepreneurs discovered that you can pull
[SPEAKER_02]: out these possibly psychoactive chemicals
or, you know, or compounds or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: from hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hemp isn't regulated that way and
neither of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden it appears at your
local gas station.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's way Delta eight and Delta 10 probably
have way more places that they're sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everywhere here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, then cannabis, because cannabis so
far they've created so many rules and
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it costs an arm and a leg just
to have a store.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's zero regulations on this stuff
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's zero regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm sure with zero regulations,
that's giving kids a lot more access to
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do fear the, um, the kid thing
specifically because typically kids are
[SPEAKER_02]: very sympathetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, nobody in the legal market or
traditional market is really advocating
[SPEAKER_02]: for a bunch of kid use whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, um, I do think that I don't
think you should ban things that adults
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy in order to protect children.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but all, you know, the way that
things that could hurt children,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, possibly, or could have a negative
impact on them, don't get regulated is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is the industry is big and powerful and
rich and has a bunch of lobbyists and they
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that they keep their grubby
hands off their stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis doesn't have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis doesn't actually have big
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, like the, the, the legacy
strain part is the part that really like
[SPEAKER_01]: grinds my gears because like, like,
just even looking at, at the idea of it is
[SPEAKER_01]: like, now they want to take a look at the
legacy strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, let's get, let's get a hold of some
of these stewards over in some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: locations in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you mean the ones that don't fucking
grow anymore because they can't afford to,
[SPEAKER_01]: they had to toss out their mother room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they were driven out by the
corporate shit these guys were all
[SPEAKER_01]: supporting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt didn't want me to talk about this
because he says we talk about it all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but I'll bring it up again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it, do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine, fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You must.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is, is that, you know, I am quite fear,
fearful of legacy strains both in seed and
[SPEAKER_02]: clone form surviving because it was always
a small group of people that cared about
[SPEAKER_02]: holding onto things that weren't currently
popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vast majority of the cannabis industry
only wants to grow things that people want
[SPEAKER_02]: in the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people, even within our community,
don't care very much about legacy unless
[SPEAKER_02]: that legacy makes them money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was already a small subset of a
small subset.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the issue is, is that that small
subset used to be able to use what was a
[SPEAKER_02]: fairly lucrative industry to fund their
little passion project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which might be keeping rare clones from
back in the day that had a popularity once
[SPEAKER_02]: that aren't very popular right now or rare
seed lines or, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt can talk about, you know,
like our buddy CSI or him or others where
[SPEAKER_02]: they make things that are commercially
viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they also have passion projects
on the side where they might get some old
[SPEAKER_02]: lines or some rare stuff or some weird
sativas that probably aren't commercially
[SPEAKER_02]: viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they might do an open pollination or
they might do a preservation project just
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep those seeds fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And see what's going on with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but what that takes is that takes
someone caring and having enough time and
[SPEAKER_02]: excess money to be able to fund that
little passion project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they're going to stretch everybody
out and everyone's going to be hanging on
[SPEAKER_02]: by a thread, it's going to make those
little passion projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to make things that aren't
currently feasible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much harder to achieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this it sounds like resoundingly
after talking to not just our,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, our friends, but people at other
seed banks and around the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like this 420 was pretty
miserable sales wise in the seed market,
[SPEAKER_01]: more probably the worst one yet in the
years that have passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, definitely like the legacy,
the legacy stuff's going to be growing
[SPEAKER_01]: tighter and tighter and tighter because it
was that that kind of stuff that was not
[SPEAKER_01]: moving at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Matt can talk about this more than
I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we used to have like a lot
of times the Emerald Cup or like the High
[SPEAKER_02]: Times cups or these various gatherings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only they were nominally an awards
ceremony and it but really what they kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of were was they were a way to sell
hundreds of booths to all kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: different vendors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those vendors could come and with a
fee and booth space and whatever else they
[SPEAKER_02]: could hawk their wares, whatever those
wares might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was actually probably the
economic driver that pushed most of these
[SPEAKER_02]: events.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was a way for, you know,
producers of seeds or flowers or topicals
[SPEAKER_02]: or extracts or, you know, whatever edible,
whatever the case may be to get in front
[SPEAKER_02]: of customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could go see and you could maybe
even talk to your heroes or you could
[SPEAKER_02]: complain to someone in person or whatever
it might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that fueled a lot of small
businesses that had a very wide and very
[SPEAKER_02]: diverse interest range.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could go and talk to Matt and,
you know, he's interested in, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, blue lines and weird Afghans and
different types of stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could go talk to somebody else
that was interested in mostly an old
[SPEAKER_02]: school Humboldt and Mendo genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could talk to somebody else that
was mostly interested in purples or.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one year in Emerald Cut, me and CSI
were literally booth to booth with NCGA
[SPEAKER_01]: right next to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a really weird situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could talk to three of the older guys
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People could get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times it was like people
wanted to buy seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, when when the industry
had more money sloshing around in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: a bunch of people would come to those
events with with cash in their pocket and
[SPEAKER_02]: tending on talking to people directly,
which wasn't always easy, and then making
[SPEAKER_02]: purchasing decisions after those chats.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a traditionally outlaw market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, I mean, that was a started
out as a harvest festival.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a lot of the outlaw market that
would bring their outlaw money,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like this was how it ran.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would buy their seeds for that
whole next year that they wanted to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a it was something that
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it fueled a it fueled a lot of what
was the Emerald Triangle at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it fueled a lot of individuality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It fueled a lot of, you know, it basically
made the scene very diffuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was able to grow some chocolate ties
and grow those lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could you could there was,
you know, all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, Matt will joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that like, you know,
we talked about it, how like 90 percent of
[SPEAKER_02]: the seed companies probably have sprung up
within the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That in that environment that allowed them
to do a bunch of shows and I.G.,
[SPEAKER_02]: allowing them to like announce drops and
do business through there, allowed them to
[SPEAKER_02]: communicate with a lot of various weed
people, small and large and connect to
[SPEAKER_02]: their customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it developed a pretty robust thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more robust it became.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more people got interested in jumping
into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of like one of those things
where like you get into real estate or
[SPEAKER_02]: something during a boom time and you've
never experienced high interest rates or
[SPEAKER_02]: depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the whole time you've been in business,
it's just booming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: With seeds, with seeds like it's everybody
can make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not hard to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's hard to do selections and in
producing new predictive breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but it's not hard to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like it is kind of hard to sell a
house in that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's not easy to sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody can make seeds like anybody do it
their first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super easy with the mail and email.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a lot of small people to like
dabble in it as an excess stream of
[SPEAKER_02]: income.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that also allowed some people to
pursue their passions or their interests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then find people that shared those
interests and sell beans to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now what's happened with the
legality of everything is that all those
[SPEAKER_02]: booths there, they all have to be licensed
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's now they've now now before the whole
thing was sort of like some kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: gray area swap meet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they have little segments of like,
oh, here's the legacy brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the little section of people that
probably can't afford to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it used to be all the people you came
to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll like we'll like make this little
section for them and we'll make them have
[SPEAKER_02]: a space because you're tired of going and
seeing all of the big corporate funded
[SPEAKER_02]: brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That have a bunch of money behind them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And none of them really have any little
passion projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: What they want is like market share and
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of those in the legacy
brands, you would go in there and you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: see they'd have like a plant there and you
could talk to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was zero seed sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were not allowed to do any seed sales
if they were licensed by the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I remember there was there was
people there was times when, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would do random stuff like I would go to
like, you know, I'll just just off the top
[SPEAKER_02]: of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to like the, the swamp boys once,
you know, and I, I smelled their mojito
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was like, oh, that was a cool jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take a pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was, there was, there was some nose
in there that I was like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, you know, but it's like,
unless you have, unless you have samples
[SPEAKER_02]: and unless you have urban, unless you have
people that can like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: smell it or smoke it or see it or talk to
the person.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might not know it exists or might not
know it cares.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what happens is, is that a lot of
the people that started making seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: started making names and started making
companies for themselves are locked out of
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like the very people that built
those scenes up into making people willing
[SPEAKER_02]: to buy expensive tickets and bring money
in their pocket to drop and allow those,
[SPEAKER_02]: those, you know, those, you know,
those high times or emerald cup or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever to sell, expensive booth space,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that all collapses because you need
people with money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the last year, the very last
year that I went to Edward cup,
[SPEAKER_01]: the only way I was allowed to go there was
to go there via a seed bank that was
[SPEAKER_01]: registered, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and, and had licenses somehow,
all that crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was allowed to interact with the
customers, but I wasn't allowed to do any
[SPEAKER_01]: direct seed sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'd come to me, excited to buy these
packs for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be like, eh, gotta go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would just upset people so much
that they couldn't just do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have that exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to, it's almost like you were
there to promote, but like you had to have
[SPEAKER_02]: a seed bank there that had all the proper
licensing and all the proper hoops and all
[SPEAKER_02]: the proper everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, before at some place like
that, you know, Matt, or any number of our
[SPEAKER_02]: buddies would show up with a trunk full of
seeds and brochures and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the new rules, it's like the
distributor has to bring it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to show up with stuff, piles of
stuff to give away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't even do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't even allowed to give stuff away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they created all these new rules and
they created all these regulations and
[SPEAKER_02]: they created all these fees and taxes and
it made them a good, it made revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and in terms of like,
you know, state fees and taxes that they
[SPEAKER_02]: got, but then a few years went by and now
who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: What they're going to think because all of
a sudden they're like reaping what they
[SPEAKER_02]: sowed and they're realizing they didn't
actually set up an industry that's
[SPEAKER_02]: thriving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have an industry that's thriving
that the only way it's thriving is you
[SPEAKER_02]: give away more of your business to more
investors to stay afloat for longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what happens is, is when that
happens, you know, especially when you get
[SPEAKER_02]: investors in there, the problem is that
since investors don't come from weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the cool little side projects,
all of the neat little stuff, all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: ways that you would treat cannabis in
order to make it really, really high
[SPEAKER_02]: quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: They start looking at that as costly and
inefficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they want to return on their
investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're not going to make any
money at your company unless you give them
[SPEAKER_02]: a return on like, you have to pay out all
this money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want money left over for you,
people start trying to figure out like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's what happened in Colorado when like
everyone was like, Oh, I need to get three
[SPEAKER_02]: or four pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most important thing is getting three
or four pounds of light because that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: only way I'm going to get a paycheck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the only way the investors are
going to start breathing off, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: stop, stop hunting me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that meant is that all these
consumers then are going to get all these
[SPEAKER_02]: strains that yield that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're pumped that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're grown at super high EC and super
high CO2 and super everything to like make
[SPEAKER_02]: them yields like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, man, this isn't as nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, the economic model is like,
we want, we want to return on our
[SPEAKER_02]: investment and the people that took the
investment money are like, I need to get
[SPEAKER_02]: paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what's happened is, is you took a
sort of like, I mean, what's funny is like
[SPEAKER_02]: Dennis Perrone made the, made the first,
you know, medical law in the, in the
[SPEAKER_02]: country with two 15 in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was very loose and it was very gray
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we, can we, can we just say thank you,
Dennis Perrone, like what an awesome dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: What an awesome dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he made it for those in a great,
great, well, a great representative of the
[SPEAKER_01]: gay community for cannabis too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he made it for the consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He made it for the sick patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: He made it for people that need,
you know, especially people, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in his community that were, you know,
HIV positive and struggling with all of
[SPEAKER_02]: the various ailments that come along with
that, especially in an era when,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, when he was pushing for it
before they really even had effective
[SPEAKER_02]: medicines to treat it like they do today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he made it very loose and sort of gray
area ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And out of that came a 20 year boom of
economic activity that revolutionized the
[SPEAKER_02]: state and in a large way and spread all
across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had the picture ready right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I can find it, but I have a picture
of Dennis Perrone.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the late seventies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just for the strain nerds that watch
this, like that really, really didn't know
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's sitting there with bowls of like
every exotic cannabis strain you could
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine from around the world in 1978,
like the biggest G on earth had somehow,
[SPEAKER_01]: like he had access to what we have today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like somehow back then in 1978,
sitting there in his little San Francisco
[SPEAKER_01]: shop, you know, all the different tie
sticks and Afghans.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the man amazes me and I'd like to
do an episode on him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he's, he's definitely,
um, and so you take him who basically did
[SPEAKER_02]: this thing that not only helped a bunch of
sick people, but also began to change
[SPEAKER_02]: America's viewpoint on what they thought
was both harmful and dangerous,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, into something that people now
mostly think is fairly benign and actually
[SPEAKER_02]: positive and kind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, we make proposition 64
and five years into it, uh, the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: thing is in crisis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a weird, it's in total crisis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nobody in any aspect of the,
of the weed game that's particularly
[SPEAKER_02]: happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, where I mean, yeah,
we even, we even have D'Angelo upset about
[SPEAKER_01]: 64 now, which is, uh, really ironic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't think it's ironic.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, he was one of the,
to me again, I keep going back to this and
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm going to sound like I'm ranting
a little bit, but I go back to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: he was one of the people that thought,
Hey, I'm fricking wealthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm richer than all these dope heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll come here and take this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, a little bit of a culture
vulture in my opinion, just my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: allegedly a culture vulture, you know,
he thought he was rich enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he found out, ah, shit,
I'm not rich enough.
Everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I, I have, I, I, you know,
I don't usually talk poorly about people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt always tries me to get me to do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but even, even back in the day and the
height of the two 15 era, um, he wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: the most important part of the cannabis
chain to be the stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wanted the most profitable place to be
the stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was always trying to cut off growers
and producers and hash makers at the
[SPEAKER_02]: knees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he wanted to buy what he could from
them as cheap as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he wanted to be the central player.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he is not the only person,
but he is a large reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he pushed proposition 64 very hard and
he was very big on being the father of
[SPEAKER_02]: legal cannabis and all this, that and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why he's changed his tune
now is because he realizes, I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: the thing that he pushed for is a disaster
in a large amount of times and he doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to get blamed for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he didn't, and he even, I think he
even got pushed out from his own company
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually, uh, over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that wasn't what he was intending on
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he was intending on ending up
being very rich and also getting to do
[SPEAKER_02]: nice time magazine pieces on being the
father of modern cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: He thought he was going to be some
combination of Dennis Perrone,
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob Marley, Willie Nelson.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was going to be, yeah, he was going to
be an old, well regarded legend.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were going to stand up and clap
when he went into the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was going to weed for warriors.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was going to, you know, do that same
thing when you're a corporate Raider,
[SPEAKER_02]: where you do a little bit of charity so
people can pay to talk good about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, he ended up just killing
the goose with the golden egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, this is one thing I've
noticed in the discord with a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: people, cause we were starting to get like
a big community in our, in our patron
[SPEAKER_01]: discord, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it started very small and kind of
cozy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were a lot of people really
tight and started getting, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit bigger and bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as more people come in, we start
getting a newer crowd, people newer
[SPEAKER_01]: growing a little bit on the outside reach,
just getting into growing and somehow
[SPEAKER_01]: they're finding out about us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they get really, really shocked when
they hear that, you know, like certain
[SPEAKER_01]: people like Steve D'Angelo may not grow in
his basement or Snoop Dogg doesn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: all these grows and tables in his rooms
pumping bubblegum cookies, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this isn't happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really, this, but it's not common
sense to everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's common sense to us as growers
that of course, of course these people
[SPEAKER_01]: that travel around to do all this shit
aren't growing and don't have moms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would they?
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people might think this is funny,
but Matt and I talk all the time about
[SPEAKER_02]: like what to talk about because some stuff
might be like in our, in our mind might be
[SPEAKER_02]: beaten to death by us, but might not be
well known or understood by the larger
[SPEAKER_02]: populace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet, or might just be important enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the state of the cannabis spot that
you kind of periodically just talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: it because you've got to keep battering it
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, eventually what happens is,
is that, you know, consumers need to force
[SPEAKER_02]: choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what large companies want to do is
they want to give you the illusion of
[SPEAKER_02]: choice while making a ton of money off
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cannabis is very unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that, like if we were going to,
I use this analogy a lot, but if we were
[SPEAKER_02]: going to go into say like the supermarket,
almost everything you buy in the
[SPEAKER_02]: supermarket, if the vegetable or the fruit
doesn't meet the production model,
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't get grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, tomatoes aren't rated
based on their flavor and their texture.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're rated based on weight and color.
[SPEAKER_02]: And does their skin split and do they rot?
[SPEAKER_02]: And can I pick it green weeks early and
ship it across the country and then ripen
[SPEAKER_02]: it and then sell it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the consumer is way far down the
list.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cannabis is unique in that no one ever
would choose to grow OG Kush in a
[SPEAKER_02]: production model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they just wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one would choose to grow OG KB or
cookies in a production model.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's lots of strains that
have gotten famous.
[SPEAKER_02]: That from a production standpoint and from
an ease of growth standpoint, aren't very
[SPEAKER_02]: desirable, but maybe their flavor,
their effect or just the customers like
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as a result of that, you know,
you know, people are getting into this
[SPEAKER_02]: business and they're like, well,
I want to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we think, you know, like they
want to grow something that just knocks it
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the park.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want it to be the biggest.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want it to be fastest.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want more.
[SPEAKER_02]: More crops a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want more yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they can just force consumers to
take the things that fit within their
[SPEAKER_02]: production model, they will.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so consumers have to fight for
choices.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now, if consumers aren't
educated about their choices in the first
[SPEAKER_01]: place, like what's out there, then that's
how stuff gets lost, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's super hard to educate people just
coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you ever get past the initial,
a lot of those people's initial point are
[SPEAKER_01]: the Snoop Dogg, are the Steve D'Angelo,
the Jim Belushi show or any of those
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you get them here?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's happened is with, you know,
Mike Tyson, I'm not even dissing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only person I'm dissing that he just
mentioned is probably is Steve D'Angelo.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the rest of them, it's like they're
just famous in other aspects of their
[SPEAKER_02]: life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you're an actor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you're a musician.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you're a famous boxer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you're whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you already have people that think
well of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so often what they do is they license
their name and their image and they kick
[SPEAKER_02]: them some money and some whatever for
doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're trying to make a brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to make familiarity with
people out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what most people are realizing is that
most of these brands are really just
[SPEAKER_02]: buying from third parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a it might they might be all the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people probably don't know that for
all the cookie stores, cookies barely
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't touch weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't think my lawyers and they make
clothing and they and almost all of their
[SPEAKER_02]: growing is third party grows that they
make contracts with and they get a right
[SPEAKER_02]: of first refusal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can choose whether or not they want
to buy it or, you know, or not based on
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever contract they arrange with that
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people think that like Berner is out
there and like they've got a team of like
[SPEAKER_02]: excellent growers that have been knocking
this stuff out and refining their craft
[SPEAKER_02]: for the last 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not their model at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, their model is to get third
parties to I mean, even when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding and stuff like that, you know,
they worked with JBZ for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: They worked with Chris Compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were they hire out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They farm out almost all of their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's let's but let's not confuse people
because realistically, like that farming
[SPEAKER_01]: out doesn't just stop at the person.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in many cases, like cookies will
farm out to someone else to make the seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and that person might farm out someone
else to make the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much so middleman in the middle of
this without naming anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many middleman in the middle of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like they get a contract and they're
like, hey, I'm going to make this amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm willing to give you this percentage of
my amount for you to do all the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the contract.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the outlet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really want to do the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how about you do all the work and I'll
give you a piece of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't do you can't get this deal
without me because I have the deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's usually multiple layers at times
of farming it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hypothetically, like if there was a
company named schmuckies and one name
[SPEAKER_01]: impound or outhouse and they're like,
hey, will you make my seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, yeah, but yeah, I'll make
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like they don't even let them
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, hey, I'm out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, little guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, can you make the seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll give you X amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kick it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bang.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's been going on in the seed
game for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and you know, I mean,
that's not even for me to like cookies is
[SPEAKER_02]: like a clothing brand and it's stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and they, but they want most,
they don't really have like QC and the way
[SPEAKER_02]: you would think where it's like,
they don't do all that stuff in-house
[SPEAKER_02]: because that affects their ability to
become multi-state operators in some way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Technically they are a seed company
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did release candy rain, didn't they?
[SPEAKER_02]: They did kind of release candy rain,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as we know, and we don't have to name
names, they farmed out the making of candy
[SPEAKER_02]: rain to a third party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that third party made them and then
they put them in, they put it in their
[SPEAKER_02]: packaging, just like they might,
whatever, you know, whatever it might be,
[SPEAKER_02]: biscotti or Cheetah Piss or this or that
or whatever, they're going to put it in
[SPEAKER_02]: their branded Mylar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like the people growing it aren't on
their payroll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they contracted it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of these big brands don't
actually, they're not actually vertical in
[SPEAKER_02]: the sense that they control their own
quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be like if, you know, I don't know if
like Gucci was actually like getting all
[SPEAKER_02]: of their stuff from like, you know,
there's like, you know, seven different
[SPEAKER_02]: Chinese sweatshops and they didn't
actually have any like quality control or
[SPEAKER_02]: anything like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and, and, and, you know,
I mean it, but it, that's, that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the state of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they don't want, they don't want
people to know that because it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it, it, you know, I mean, I, any reason
why, it's a joke that 10 years ago or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, you know, people thought that
like their cookies was like hand watered
[SPEAKER_02]: by burner, you know, like in the Bay when
it was really first coming out that like
[SPEAKER_02]: all the cookies that was there was like
from four or five different dudes,
[SPEAKER_02]: all carefully curating it and making it
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were early on to realize that
like the brand was the thing and they
[SPEAKER_02]: could farm out the work and still make a
big percentage for being the guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they were very early on and
figuring out that everything was a brand
[SPEAKER_01]: branding was everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And weed wasn't ready for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever seen one of these things in
action?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever seen this real quick?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what they call it ashtray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I heard it before we started suck the
bowl clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to, I'm going to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a, one of the C2 glass ones,
but it, I can't always get it to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it hadn't take a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very non relaxing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I don't, maybe, maybe I need to
love it to get a better suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know if you can see what the,
it like sucked around, but the center is
[SPEAKER_01]: still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was worth a try.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's a terrible sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the sound I want to hear when
I'm trying to relax and smoke some
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I wouldn't mind if it did a good job,
but that did not work very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's get back to where you were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that wasn't obnoxious as all hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a little obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, yeah, I didn't know it was going
to be that loud, loud, loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like very high RPM.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right next to the microphone too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like the, to the state of the
affairs, it's kind of like what's happened
[SPEAKER_02]: in a nutshell is there's vast
overproduction in almost every state that
[SPEAKER_02]: gets recreational, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens fairly quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then the glut leads to price wars
where stores and distributors start
[SPEAKER_02]: purchasing things based on pricing and
margins for themselves, which leads to a
[SPEAKER_02]: lack of choice for consumers because they
don't get to pick amongst the quality
[SPEAKER_02]: because the distros and the stores are
buying things that are most advantageous
[SPEAKER_02]: for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then being like, you know, here's 28 kinds
of, you know, these Buffy to decent and a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of things that randomly are nice,
but they're all in Mylar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully you guess which one's good
and I'll take your money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what happens is, is that you hear
all this talk, this might be pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: political or whatever, but you hear all
this talk about how the black market or
[SPEAKER_02]: the traditional market is affecting the
legal market and the legal market would
[SPEAKER_02]: have a lot better sales and be a lot more
robust.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we just didn't have all of this black
market or all of this traditional market
[SPEAKER_02]: or medical market demand going on,
which is hamstringing our new legal
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they mostly blame it on cartel black
market specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they just try to intertwine that
propaganda is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this might get me in trouble,
but, um, I think, I think it's actually
[SPEAKER_02]: reversed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and what I mean by that is that I
think that it's very true that the white
[SPEAKER_02]: market people, um, would all like all of
the black market producers to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they, they want the supply of the
black market to stop, but that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: because they think that there would be
hordes of new people pouring into the
[SPEAKER_02]: stores that would robustly boost up their
white market sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so that they can take their excess
and dump it into the market share that was
[SPEAKER_02]: formally being supplied by the
traditional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what happened in California is
the first couple of years as this
[SPEAKER_02]: overproduction problem happened,
there was a lot of diversion that people
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't, people don't want to admit that
metric is both cumbersome, expensive and
[SPEAKER_02]: super ineffective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's an open secret in the industry,
how poorly metric works at keeping things
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's supposed to be kept.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need to get into the chorus and
it's not, and, and, and anyone that wants
[SPEAKER_02]: to can get around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so most large and medium sized
companies that aren't legacy and aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: fairly small, end up having to divert a
decent portion of what they make into the
[SPEAKER_02]: black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that worked for a few years until
production and overproduction got to a
[SPEAKER_02]: point where they started having difficulty
doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are complaints that the black
market is messing them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't about their white market sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about their traditional diversionary
sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what they want is they want the
traditional supply to go away so that the
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional demand is more robust for them
to supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause obviously the smokers will keep
being smokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's this thing that like,
you know, Matt and I were looking at not
[SPEAKER_02]: long ago where like this past year,
Canada, which has gone totally legal,
[SPEAKER_02]: they destroyed like 425 million grams of
unsold cannabis that had expired,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was 28% of the yearly crop that had
been produced in the past 12 months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that worked out to like,
what was it like nine?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even, it was like 916 tons or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, it was an enormous amount,
whatever anyone who wants to do the math.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, you can look it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Canada destroys 425 million
grams or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they actually, what that means for
Canada though, is that means whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: system Canada has, they're actually
preventing a large, at least that amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of it from being diverted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's sitting there and then
eventually it gets old and expired.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they light it on fire and get rid
of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard, maybe I'm wrong,
but I haven't heard of a single
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational state that has had to step in
and destroy a bunch of expired cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: products of any kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know of any.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear of a lot of people sitting on a lot
of stuff, but I don't know if that's even,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what market that is when I
hear that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but there should be,
maybe, maybe there's not, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's eventually there's rules where
it's probably too old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm not even trying to call people
out or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just trying to like, they get into
business, they set up a 500 lighter,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and all of a sudden they realize
that, you know, they're growing seven,
[SPEAKER_02]: 800 pounds a rip five times a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not enough demand with all the
other indoors going around for them to off
[SPEAKER_02]: all of their product into the white.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I mean, I think a lot of it
too, like, I mean, a big portion of it
[SPEAKER_01]: started because it was, it was people in
the, the white, like the, the people with
[SPEAKER_01]: the financing, talking to the very first
people in cannabis that they meet who
[SPEAKER_01]: could be any Tom, Dick or Harry there that
has the balls to say that they have run X
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of lights that hasn't run any
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I mean, realistically, how many
guys, uh, free to 15 were running,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, hundreds of lighters,
but how many people stuck up their hands
[SPEAKER_01]: and said, I, I can run that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a bunch of people that
said I can run five acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a major fucking problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how to run.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how to run a crew of 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, that's a major problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that almost reaches to the
disconnect that I've been speaking about
[SPEAKER_01]: with the, the legacy strains and,
and the universities is that there's still
[SPEAKER_01]: that disconnect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that disconnect between the people
with the money or financing or the people
[SPEAKER_01]: with the science that are writing the
history books and the traditional market
[SPEAKER_01]: that's done this all along because
everybody's trying to work everybody,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in between the middle men are
all trying to get between and work between
[SPEAKER_01]: the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these two have never spoken.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really feel like there's very little
communications ever gone on without these,
[SPEAKER_01]: these shifty ass middle men.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you want, if you want,
yeah, if you want to take a, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, uh, a free market approach,
you know, to it, Dennis Perrone's version
[SPEAKER_02]: was very lightly regulated, the light
touch of government and let, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: human ingenuity and commerce built.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the legal situation has been,
in my opinion, legal is actually the wrong
[SPEAKER_02]: word.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more like highly taxed, highly
regulated, very controlled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a result of that, they've created
so many different barriers and so many
[SPEAKER_02]: different inefficiencies that you have
these people that are exploiting all these
[SPEAKER_02]: different inefficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you go in and you can go in states
from gluts where nobody can make any money
[SPEAKER_02]: and the price of cannabis falls below the
cost of production to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: droughts where it spikes briefly,
you know, and people are getting crazy
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars for different things because it's
all volatile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, it's just not,
it's not open and fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as a result of that, you know,
there's like, I think there's like 40
[SPEAKER_02]: million people in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, is there, I don't even think
there's a thousand legal stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have no clue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you know, like you're in a
different part of California than I am,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's all kinds of counties,
especially in the Eastern part of
[SPEAKER_02]: California that have banned dispensaries
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't think we have any here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be outside our county.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dispensary dispensaries are mostly a
coastal county phenomenon all the way from
[SPEAKER_02]: San Diego up to Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your county touches the ocean,
you probably have a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if your county is, is along or east of
the five, you probably don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much it, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so you give all these people
that have opt outed where it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: so like they allowed massive production to
take place because they collected all this
[SPEAKER_02]: upfront money and then they restricted the
hell out of where it could be sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a glut and you give a lot of
power to the dispensaries and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: power to the distros.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where before distros didn't even need to
exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: A farmer could go directly to a dispensary
and they could make a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you have to have another middleman.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you have to have in California,
you have to have a special delivery
[SPEAKER_02]: license.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm a farmer and I want to drive my
product to a dispensary, I have to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: delivery license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise it's not legal for me to have it
on the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it was grown on my own farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only legal on my property.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as kids, we watched the movie
Robin Hood, Disney movie Robin Hood,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we all saw King John or, you know,
or no, the sheriff in Nottingham.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all knew that motherfucker would
come around and tax people for their
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even as kids, we knew, what does it make
any sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not that man's money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give that man his money back.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as adults, we've all made this
invisible agreement that this is okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shakedown that's going on is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe it's just my punk rock ethos.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your punk rock ethos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people choose when I get
shook down by where that money goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five years ago, I think there was a lot of
people that despite their reservations in
[SPEAKER_02]: 64 were like, you know, this could suck in
a variety of ways, but at least I'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to make a living, support my family,
put my money in the bank, never get
[SPEAKER_02]: raided.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: My kids won't ever, you know, nobody will
know what a go bag is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and for people that don't know,
up here, a go bag used to be, you would
[SPEAKER_02]: have a bag packed with a bunch of stuff,
essentials for you or maybe your family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your family would know that like,
if you got raided, go run into the woods
[SPEAKER_02]: and hide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab the money, go run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your go bag is going to get you to the
neighbors or it's going to allow you to
[SPEAKER_02]: survive for a day or two until they leave
and you can come back safely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and there was a bunch of people
that didn't want that stress and they were
[SPEAKER_02]: like, okay, well, this deal seems kind of
crappy, but at least I'll be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: legally support my family, put my money in
the bank and just have a normal business.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these people had PTSD,
like real genuine PTSD from being raided
[SPEAKER_01]: and having their family's lives upturned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an occupational hazard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're a minor, maybe you get
black lung.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're an office worker, maybe you get
carpal tunnel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're a rug layer or a
roofer, maybe you blow out your back or
[SPEAKER_02]: have a herniated disc.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you are a cannabis farmer,
even if you were like fully, fully legal
[SPEAKER_02]: and selling all of your product to a
dispensary, just like 215 intended and all
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cops could still hit you and be like,
you're going to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't mean that you might not win
in court, but you still got raided and
[SPEAKER_02]: went to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your plants are all gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got cut down and they took what
they wanted and now you're fighting it
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, people thought
initially, but what's happened now is it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, it's gone on long enough
where that's the reason why a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: these, a lot of these, you know,
up here in my area, four or five years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago, people used to sell cannabis
properties at a premium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh my God, look at this ranch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fully developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's turnkey.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got all this grow on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can come in and you can make,
you know, you have a turnkey business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you see a bunch of these same
properties and they're like way less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, a lot of times it's
like, it's a losing money proposition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They took something that took a ton of
Californians and a ton of rural areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And brought them out of poverty and
created an enormous amount of economic
[SPEAKER_02]: activity, both in the rural areas and in
the cities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they somehow, like I said before,
they killed the goose that leg,
[SPEAKER_02]: the golden egg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nobody wants to admit, nobody wants to
admit that they made a bunch of mistakes
[SPEAKER_02]: and how they're going to redo it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's going to happen in the next
couple of years is I think they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you're going to see like this thing
has been propped up by a bunch of investor
[SPEAKER_02]: money getting poured into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when that investor money stops,
right, which it's starting to stop because
[SPEAKER_02]: when you start seeing investors start
suing people, it's because they've
[SPEAKER_02]: realized they've given up hope that
they're going to, now they're worried
[SPEAKER_02]: about their principal investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they go from like, oh, I'm going to
make a ton of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're worried about, I'm going to
try to recoup what I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to recoup, you know,
I'm going to try to mitigate my losses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as a result of that, if that's the
case, then you're going to see a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: contraction, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it, I think most people,
if you asked most smokers that have been
[SPEAKER_02]: around, that at least have been smoking
since say like 2008, they would probably
[SPEAKER_02]: tell you they preferred the stores in the
two 15 era.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as quality and diversity of what
they had access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the, just the things you could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you could, in two 15 era,
you could run a breeding project and like
[SPEAKER_01]: your fricking dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it didn't, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could also get popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you could get popped that day,
but everybody knew like, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody bells out real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: A week later, run your shit and you're
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another six months, you do the
same shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I should make a political statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the biggest thing that, you know,
you were talking about that article and
[SPEAKER_02]: like studying Delta eight, Delta 10 and
THC and harm to children or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and legacy strains, the biggest thing
they could do for legacy strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't need some $20 million
university study program.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could just make it be like,
okay, if you're, if you want to beat
[SPEAKER_02]: non-commercial cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if you have a breeding pro
program, with 200 plants in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the reason why they're scared to do
that is because they're scared that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to grow 205 pound plants and grow,
you know, a literal, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to grow a thousand pounds of
weed and you're going to sell it on the
[SPEAKER_02]: black market and you're going to make a
ton of money and how they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: differentiate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at like the heirloom
vegetables, like Baker Creek or any of
[SPEAKER_02]: those people, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why all those heirloom
vegetables survived was because there was
[SPEAKER_02]: a bunch of enthusiasts that were able to
breed and grow and trade seeds and trade
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars and do all this stuff with zero
government care or regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without worry about getting their
family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to preserve the legacy,
allow all the weed nerds to have whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: plant count they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're not selling it and you want
to have 500 plants in your garage,
[SPEAKER_02]: let them, if you want to do a big seed pop
and hunt for rare traits, you're after and
[SPEAKER_02]: try to create a new strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them, you know, you can still make
rules where like, you're not allowed to
[SPEAKER_02]: send this out of state or we don't want
you to sell it or, you know, we don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: you to this or that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, failing that it's like,
if they, if they want preservation of
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics, they should make rules that
allow legally you to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't have to have this super
taxed, super regulated commercial only
[SPEAKER_02]: legality, because that's essentially what
they've done is they're like, if,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's only legal if you're
commercially paying them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think a private farmer right now
can have like four or six plants or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's called a shakedown.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not, that's not, that's not saving
moms that you care about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not popping a bunch of seeds and
doing a phenol hunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not saving things from the phenol
hunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not being like, Oh, I just popped,
you know, 50 seeds of riots, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever hybrid, you know, strawberry
switch blade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's 10 of them I like that I want
to run again and compare them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no doing that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you want to do that in a four by
eight tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a two by two space you couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're growing them little popsicles.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's preposterous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the biggest thing that they could do
for legacy is let all the weed nerds and
[SPEAKER_02]: let all the preservationists and let all
the people that have all that stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: give them the freedom to play around with
weed non-commercial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is what every other vegetable and
fruit can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they make it, it's only legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to have this extremely
expensive to maintain and set up business,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of non-commercial cannabis
that might have value later on that we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't even know about.
[SPEAKER_02]: There could be cancer curing compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There could be, there could be ones that
are better for glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: There could be ones that are better for
nausea or HIV or this or that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't even think that's anybody's
concern except maybe the PhD academics
[SPEAKER_01]: that are looking into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think they, again,
there's that disconnect of these middlemen
[SPEAKER_01]: that have made this big wall between the
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you allow us to preserve legally,
then we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the PhDs and all the testing and all
that, that can happen later because we're
[SPEAKER_02]: already doing it for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just so bad at letting,
taking something, the government taking
[SPEAKER_01]: something and then being like,
all right, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want me to be real political,
going back to Overgrow, which was Overgrow
[SPEAKER_02]: and Cannabis World were the first two
really big forums where people that didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: know each other could gather and talk
about weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole Overgrow concept was
literally if everyone over, if everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: grows, we're going to overgrow the
government's ability to criminalize all of
[SPEAKER_02]: us and they'll have to change it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if there's enough civil disobedience
going on where we're like, this law sucks
[SPEAKER_02]: and enough people do it, they can't jail
the entire population.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't even jail most of the
population.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can only jail a tiny fraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, like I don't think the
fight has is over at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, no, I don't think it's over my whole
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been like, you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're evil for having it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a scumbag.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're like, hey, this thing you
got, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want, we'll take it from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to give us all your knowledge
and all your strains and all your seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: and all that and let us you and let us
commercially, you will take you did a good
[SPEAKER_02]: job.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll we'll take it from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think I don't think the fight is
over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the fight has changed and that
they're losing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're finally starting to give us
medical and recreational at a wide scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, I guess for my again,
my point of view being the punk rock kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of point of view, it's like, I didn't give
a shit what they thought then when it was
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a shit what they think now
when it's legal.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this is what you got to read.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what you got to realize though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, is that when they didn't want us to
have it at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: That made it a lot more lucrative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as such, that it was lucrative.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allowed us to fund our insurgency,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allowed us to fund seed making,
clone, clone saving, clone sharing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it allowed us to fund our punk
rock side of things.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your fear that you talked about before
is that, you know, they crashed the price
[SPEAKER_02]: so much that the people that are trying to
enact change can't sell fund.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, I mean, take it from like,
obviously, like the weed fight that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing is totally nonviolent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I often wonder, like when the American
government was in Afghanistan,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, would we have, would we have beaten
the Taliban if the Taliban didn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: hashish and opium to fund their
operations?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in the sense that like,
you know, they were able to get,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, at some point, I can't remember
when, but it was like, I read this thing
[SPEAKER_02]: where like, you know, we were three,
four years into the, into the fight over
[SPEAKER_02]: there and they were like, Afghanistan is
producing 90% of the world's heroin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that obviously, who was,
who was making that money?
[SPEAKER_02]: Our government usually.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just mean that like, it allowed
those, like, you know, like a resistance
[SPEAKER_02]: movement has to have some level of
funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I understood it, it was the Taliban
trying to clear it out because they were
[SPEAKER_01]: religious fundamentalists and us
protecting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, who knows what went on over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely think that, you know,
they might, I don't know if they're
[SPEAKER_02]: clearing it out again, but it's like any
kind of movement needs something to fund
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, maybe it was a bad analogy or
whatever, but they were able to,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they were able to use the hash
trade and weed, or maybe they weren't even
[SPEAKER_02]: all that involved in it and they just took
protection money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the farmers and the dealers and the
people that needed to use the trade routes
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, in the 2015,
15 era and in the illegal era,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was much smaller, but it was also much
more profitable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you stayed hidden, you could
kind of do what you wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I think they're trying to trick us by
being like, okay, we'll give you what you
[SPEAKER_02]: want, but it's only kind of what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's basically us taking most of what
you want, but we'll take away some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: fear of you getting in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in return, you'll give up your hope
and allow us to just, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: to just take this over from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the growing side.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll let you smoke, but we got the back
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to me, it's like, until I'm able to
grow weed in my backyard, like I'm able to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow cucumbers or tomatoes or whatever,
like think about before Whole Foods and
[SPEAKER_02]: before the 20 years ago when like the
organic revolution really like took hold
[SPEAKER_02]: in America and got like more mainstream,
like all the people doing all those
[SPEAKER_02]: heirloom vegetables and fruits and stuff,
we're all a bunch of crunchy hippies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And back to nature types and weird little
farmers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people didn't even know that was
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And little co-ops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was little co-ops.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was little things going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was small groups of enthusiasts that
kept all that stuff alive until big
[SPEAKER_02]: companies were like, oh, people want this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll carry some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we, in order for weed to have that
happen, they need to allow the
[SPEAKER_02]: enthusiasts, they need to allow the people
with passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to allow the people with a touch
of the tism who get into it like that
[SPEAKER_02]: deeply and care that deeply about lineage
and strains and history and old things to
[SPEAKER_02]: preserve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you see that happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I just said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we need to make it actually
legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how do we get lobbyists?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's how people get things
legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how do people like us,
the strain nerds, how do we assemble to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to enact power?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in a dark time in the moment because
they changed all the rules on us by
[SPEAKER_02]: partially giving us what we wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now everyone's realizing that was a
little bit of like fool's gold,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so probably what it's going to take is
what I think is going to happen is they're
[SPEAKER_02]: not going to really start to look at
changing all the rules and regulations
[SPEAKER_02]: until the states start failing and get
embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've consulted on some pretty big projects
here and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I talk to people in big ag,
they just can't believe the rules and
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations and bullshit that we have to
jump through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're used to being able at a large
level to cowboy up and kind of do what
[SPEAKER_02]: they want with wide choices and latitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all based on being efficient and
having good production models and this and
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the hand of the government is pretty
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and you know, that's what we
need is we need a light hand right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a heavy hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and there's people that are
trying to steal it from us and there's
[SPEAKER_02]: people in our community that are banding
with them, hoping to help them steal it
[SPEAKER_02]: from us, but to get personally wealthy
along the way and make it for them and
[SPEAKER_02]: their family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all those people need to get mostly
screwed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd be nice if they did.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, a lot of them are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let's let's put it this way,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, you could talk about,
you know, there's that there's let's put
[SPEAKER_02]: it this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need to name who, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's he thinking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you want to be sued by Scots?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a massive corporation with endless
money and probably lawyers that are five
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred dollars an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you want them to come after you?
[SPEAKER_01]: They win.
[SPEAKER_01]: They win suits where they're they sound
like they're the devil and they win the
[SPEAKER_01]: suits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so some of the some of these rich
investors are like, you know, you know
[SPEAKER_02]: what Bernie Madoff problem was?
[SPEAKER_02]: He stole from other rich people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they figured it out, they were
like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to call up my five hundred
dollar an hour lawyer, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm going to get his law firm,
you know, and then, you know, you get
[SPEAKER_02]: dozens of people doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's going to happen with a bunch
of these investors when they find out that
[SPEAKER_02]: they poured their money down the toilet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they found out that a bunch of a bunch
of like non-ethical hustlers were sloshing
[SPEAKER_02]: their money around and not really treating
it the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you think, you know, so do you
think there's a chance that that any kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of major corporation predicted that this
is what would happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in my opinion, I don't think that
this is that out of the realm of logic for
[SPEAKER_01]: all having taken place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like from watching how alcohol became what
it was to now and stuff and how many
[SPEAKER_01]: people ripped it off and got in the middle
between the gray areas and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alcohol is a totally, alcohol is a totally
different scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a totally different scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: But look at all the dirty middlemen in
between and how many people that were like
[SPEAKER_01]: actually outlaws doing it got screwed in
the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the whole scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's a well, you can kind of say
they got screwed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like if you want to, I mean,
this is getting really off track.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want to look at alcohol,
the reason why alcohol got made illegal,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you can look it up, was because before
prohibition, like Americans were the was
[SPEAKER_02]: the drunkest country on earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was men drinking gallons upon
gallons of whiskey.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was mass like absences on Mondays on
the work week because people were so hung
[SPEAKER_02]: over from the from from the weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The abolitionists, the prohibitionists,
the reason why they were so against it was
[SPEAKER_02]: because the level of public drunkenness,
like if you just type into Google,
[SPEAKER_02]: like how much they drank then versus
today, it's astronomical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason they got rid of it wasn't
because they made a big mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was because they were like,
oh, man, like, we fueled these criminal
[SPEAKER_02]: groups to where they've taken over almost
every major city and they actually run the
[SPEAKER_02]: cops and they run the mayors and they're
electing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're doing this and they're doing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone's disobeying us like
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's creating this horrific thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like after they got rid of
prohibition, it took them an extra 50 or
[SPEAKER_02]: 60 years to break the mob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was just thinking like Kennedy,
like I was all the way up into 63 that and
[SPEAKER_01]: he was alcohol prohibition like his dad,
not him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm saying that he had political effect
all the way up until 63 to get his sons
[SPEAKER_01]: elected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and there's there's almost no doubt
that the I mean, that the Chicago mob
[SPEAKER_02]: helped Kennedy get elected and helped him
win Illinois.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and I'm not I'm not trying
to like, you know, divert on a tangent,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like weed weed has not like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alcohol fueled so much money that it
corrupted so many police forces,
[SPEAKER_02]: so much government, so many mayors,
so many senators, so many different things
[SPEAKER_02]: that they almost in order to restore
order, they had to stop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a massive failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, they didn't stop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's not got cannabis like,
you know, criminal groups or whatever that
[SPEAKER_02]: like own mayors that own the police forces
that are like there's not enough money
[SPEAKER_02]: sloshing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's just not that, you know,
I mean, like they said, like Al Capone or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that, you know,
he's worth like, you know, seven hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: million dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But looking at it just strictly from a
business model, it was very easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: predict how it was going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was going to be people who thought
they were rich enough to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there were going to be the actual
rich people who could take loss that had
[SPEAKER_01]: way more money than the people that
thought they were rich here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Losses longer and play the longer game.
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, economics, you know,
like I've consulted for people that I
[SPEAKER_02]: think are incredibly rich at times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like in order for those incredibly
rich people to you still have to realize
[SPEAKER_02]: that like they invest their money in so
many different things that like cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: has to be as good or better than other
places they could put their money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they're discovering is that
cannabis is actually quite a bit worse
[SPEAKER_02]: than most other places they could put
their money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabis might have extracted a ton of
investment out of all these different
[SPEAKER_02]: types of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But eventually there's the situation where
like you've been losing money for four or
[SPEAKER_02]: five years and you're like, oh,
I thought that, you know, profit would be
[SPEAKER_02]: around the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's not, you might just cut bait
and start putting that money you are
[SPEAKER_02]: pouring into it into, you know,
into something that's going to make you
[SPEAKER_02]: money right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's economics.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys outlast these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think they predict that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's people that are trying to
outlast others, but I think that there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of losers that thought they would be
in the outlast category.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that's economics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys that fall out never think they're
going to be the ones that fall out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always think they're the richest in
the house that are going to be the guys
[SPEAKER_01]: that are the smartest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I could do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is, is that like looking at like
that, like there's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: New York just opened up and New York has
like five stores open.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to like build this,
this legal industry and there's all these
[SPEAKER_02]: news reports now of like, you know,
hundreds of bodegas illegally selling
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis that they know is from
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, how in the hell are we
going to stop this thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, they don't,
they don't get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like one of the things that alcohol did
that was vastly different than cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: that alcohol was made legal at the federal
level when they repealed the amendment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all 50 states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that there was certain counties and
there was certain places that are still
[SPEAKER_02]: dry to this day in Arkansas and you know,
there's Missouri.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some places in the deep south that
are still dry counties and you can't buy
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now, as long as there's legal
counties, not legal counties, legal
[SPEAKER_02]: states, not legal states, it's going to be
chaos and they won't be able to control
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look at Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oklahoma used to be one of the worst
places to get caught with cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_02]: entire United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: You used to be able to read in high times
that people got caught with like 12 plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and got 50 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it used to be incredibly severe and
then they're pretty Republican.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're like, okay, we're just
going to like make it legal and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to have almost no government
regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they do that for a few years and
then they realize that like most of the
[SPEAKER_02]: grows are cartel or Chinese nationals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're using and they're using
Oklahoma as a base to supply all the
[SPEAKER_02]: illegal states in the southern part of
southeastern part of the United States and
[SPEAKER_02]: Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only four million people in
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they allow like 3000 acres to supply
like four million people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're shocked at diversion.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so, yeah, I mean, I,
I think the fight right now is the people
[SPEAKER_02]: that care are, are hurting because the
game has changed and it's hard to adapt to
[SPEAKER_02]: change that happens really quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the parts that Matt and I care
about are, you know, I mean, we're for the
[SPEAKER_02]: small guy, you know, we want, we want it,
we want as much experimentation as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want people to be able to like,
you know, pursue their little dreams or
[SPEAKER_02]: their little interests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if you want to start a
small company and you want to start a
[SPEAKER_02]: small business, it shouldn't take millions
of dollars of outside capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to get a small one up and running and
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, I think the first thing that
really shocked me when I, when I talked to
[SPEAKER_01]: the very first person that went from,
you know, traditional market to legal was
[SPEAKER_01]: how much money it costs just to get the
equipment for the, for the government to
[SPEAKER_01]: surveil you via metric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was like, you have to pay all
this money just for them to, to snitch on
you?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's farms in Santa Barbara
that have to pay 800 to a million dollars
[SPEAKER_02]: or more just for their licenses every
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for a 10,000 square foot license,
which is the size of a, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: basically a football field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go back to my Robin Hood comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just it's base logic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know it as, as at our heart,
we know we shouldn't be getting shut down
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it's honestly, what would
happen is if you want, if you,
[SPEAKER_02]: what I think would happen is that if they
actually made a metric that worked and
[SPEAKER_02]: they drew like a big bright line where
legal couldn't get diverted at all,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think 80 to nine, I think 80% of the
farms in the state would fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be mostly the big farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they would be unsustainable and it
would be the smaller farms that are more,
[SPEAKER_02]: that are more nimble, that are better at
growing, that could produce a better
[SPEAKER_02]: quality product that would honestly
probably survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I used to think that it would be
a couple big farms, smushing everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually don't think without exportation
to other states or other areas,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's actually feasible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most of those things would fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: You lived, you live in an area where there
is a demand for crafts still where there
[SPEAKER_01]: is a quantity of smokers that do care
about quality and no quality in the first
[SPEAKER_01]: place to care about quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're in one of these many other
cities that aren't one of the meccas of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, it wasn't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have never seen quality in
the first place to no quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that like a small family,
I'm not, I don't think I'm optimistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think you're optimistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that all these big,
big farms, are surviving on fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: investment and diversion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, like, I mean,
I remember, I'm not going to call it who
[SPEAKER_02]: it is because it's unimportant,
but I was consulting on something and they
[SPEAKER_02]: had like a, they had a pretty good sized
farm down south.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of their sales guys came to me all
panicked and he was like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I just, I got all for all the
legal sales for all the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, this is really weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, what's weird?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, if we hit the numbers,
you say we can hit, we could supply 90% of
[SPEAKER_02]: the state in sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, where is it all going?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you're starting to figure
it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as a result, it's like,
I think, I think without exportation,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think all of these huge farms would
implode underneath their own weight.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think they would.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the difference between the
small family farms up by me and the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the big farms down there is the big farms
down there are all funded by rich people
[SPEAKER_02]: that can just divert their money and go do
something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the small farm and the small farms up
in Humboldt Mendo and these different
[SPEAKER_02]: spots, like the people up here have no
other choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, there's no, there's no choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're already happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like we can rewind the tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't rewind the tape on what we've
lost in the families that have lost us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also, it also boomed during 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot, I don't want to call
anybody out again, but there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: rich kids that came up here and bought
properties with their family money and
[SPEAKER_02]: then hired one of their buddies to run it
after a year or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then ended up living in Santa Rosa or
the Bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or LA or wherever, and just taking a
percentage because they owned the land
[SPEAKER_02]: that their parents bought them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there was a lot of, there was a
lot of out of town people that bought
[SPEAKER_02]: property up here, you know, cause it just
funded their Burning Man lifestyle or it
[SPEAKER_02]: funded their Hawaii or funded their this
or that to give them a bunch of free time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, imagine you could set up a
scene and you're like, okay, I'll hire you
[SPEAKER_02]: to run my spot, but I can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a 50, 50 split.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go get these neck cat cheese
while you do all this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to do all this work,
but I provide the spot, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can't afford the spot,
but I can because my parents bought it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they have good credit and they put
down the down payment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very typical though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very typical.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't want to, people don't want to
admit it, but there was a bunch of people,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're all, they're all fleeing the
county now because their business model
[SPEAKER_02]: failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't give a percentage for nothing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but there was, and there was a
lot of middlemen too that were making a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not doing very much, but I'm just saying
the people that are actually willing to
[SPEAKER_02]: like work, work their spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because I think what,
what would happen is, is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: imagine, imagine you have a 40 acre farm,
you know, that could be, that could be 41
[SPEAKER_02]: acre farms, or that could be 160,
10,000 square foot farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and those little farms, you know,
it's, it's, it's just like, what do you
[SPEAKER_02]: think better weed comes out of a four
lighter or a four or 500 lighter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, smaller is, smaller is generally
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like, there is like a size at
which you're not going to be able to get,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, craft anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants to agree what that size is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause everybody wants to call whatever
project they're on craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but let's just face it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, eventually it's too big and
you're having hired help that aren't as
[SPEAKER_02]: good as you, care for most of your plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the way it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't, I mean, I'm not even trying to
be all that hopeful because it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a very stressful time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I worry that even if like,
I managed to survive or not me or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, various people up in my area
managed to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most won't under the current, under the
current, under the current situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then as a result of that,
my community, falls into poverty again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that goes the legacy strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's why I said like,
when I saw that article to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, it's just like, you are a year and a
half too late to even be trying to,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, granted, there are a lot of things
left that, that haven't been lost that are
[SPEAKER_01]: in libraries.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are still people keeping these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everything is lost, but there are so
like, if they gave any help, any shits
[SPEAKER_01]: about legacy, anything they would have
been doing this from the jump.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they realized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other part of it too, is that even
if, even if they do have all this money
[SPEAKER_02]: and even if like these, even if these like
various colleges or whatever are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: start doing it, does that mean that these
like small, you know, preservationists or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever are going to like give over their
legacy stuff to these researchers?
[SPEAKER_01]: We already know what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we saw it happen in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just, is that just a way for wealthy
people to collect all the, because the
[SPEAKER_02]: thing is, is that wealthy people have
everything that we don't except for the
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge of how to do a good job,
the connections within the community and
[SPEAKER_02]: the strains and what's real and what's
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can get all the permits.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can hire the construction companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can get the lawyers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can get locked.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can do all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just, but when it comes to actually
growing it, processing it, trimming it,
[SPEAKER_02]: putting good weed in the bag and then
knowing what the differences are,
[SPEAKER_02]: they have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a lot of states that have gone
legal, they want to hire people to teach
[SPEAKER_02]: them and they want to get the strains and
then they want to fire them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: After they have the strains and after they
have the SOPs and after they have the so
[SPEAKER_02]: how they're like, Oh, I don't need you
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my biggest fear with the legacy study
is you could say, Oh, it's too little too
[SPEAKER_02]: late.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have done this a while ago,
but like, what does that money go to?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they going to study?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm trying to tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in, in, we've already seen what,
what happens with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to me it's obvious what's going on
because they just did this in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Philippines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it another phylos or Thailand?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean like over in Thailand,
they, they have, they have a lady there as
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand it, allegedly not very well
tied in by what she's saying in
[SPEAKER_01]: representing as, as history of Thai
strains, which are really grown by Laotian
[SPEAKER_01]: communities in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they now have like four or five,
like land race legacy strains that you
[SPEAKER_01]: could come get and get in Thailand only
as, you know, like, and they use it like
[SPEAKER_01]: a, a fricking a shopping thing,
like a marketing ploy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I like, we know like in
my, in my heart, I know where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should say, I shouldn't say we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I know where they're going with it
because we see, we see the shit all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we saw people go to Oklahoma and all
the same people going to Oklahoma are now
[SPEAKER_01]: in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like how many, it just, everything
mimics each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cared about legacy strains of
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made international news, real
international news.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden they want to fund this
thing for legacy strains in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: People got mad at me about Oklahoma or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have some, I have some prejudices
against it because someone I knew pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: well got in prison there for a very long
time in the Grateful Dead era for weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, Matt and I used to joke a
little bit that like every disreputable
[SPEAKER_02]: character in cannabis, like, like,
like fell upon Oklahoma is the great new
[SPEAKER_02]: hope, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and that's kind of what, like what
people are chasing is they're bouncing
[SPEAKER_02]: around to a new state and being like,
maybe I can get three to five years out of
[SPEAKER_02]: it before the compression hits and I can
make money and I can bounce around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and there's opportunity here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there's opportunity there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there's opportunity over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe there's a window where I can
succeed before all these things I know are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to hit hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I can bounce to the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just see like, like this be the
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to say this specifically as
an example, because it's something that
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't possibly happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's going on in Canada,
but like an opportunity for someone like
[SPEAKER_01]: the bull rider strain that they really
have nothing to do with at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, Oh, this is a legacy strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, perfect time to market these two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come get your bull rider at the fucking,
you know, like, and nothing has anything
[SPEAKER_01]: to do with anything in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the real legacy growers that have
this stuff are like, and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists are studying that because
they're like, Hey, you know, and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones who write the history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we won't name names, but like some
of the same people that like ran towards
[SPEAKER_02]: the money first.
[SPEAKER_02]: When, you know, went in 2017 and 2018,
when this thing started kicking off,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are probably going to be the people,
if there's money involved, there'll
[SPEAKER_02]: probably be the people running towards the
end and being like, I can help you with
[SPEAKER_02]: legacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the whole deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a huge collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hear you pay me this amount and
I'll grab these things for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I don't, I like,
I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to pay me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the time you figure out,
I haven't given you what you're supposed
[SPEAKER_02]: to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for any of those people, like
perspective, uh, people that are in those
[SPEAKER_01]: positions to be hiring these people,
if you see in these people's past resumes,
[SPEAKER_01]: like Colorado, Thailand, like all this
movement through the cannabis States as
[SPEAKER_01]: they go, probably double-think it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's my best advice I could give
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just double-think it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Double, double interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a second interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give second interviews, two interviews for
that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to have, I used to have this like
running joke with friends that like my
[SPEAKER_02]: consultation thing would be that I would
sit next to people and I would listen to
[SPEAKER_02]: the person pitch you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would talk to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would tell you if they were
full of shit or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be able to tell, you know,
and because it's like one of those things
[SPEAKER_02]: like you and I know, like you can only,
you can fake the talk to people that know
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you sit down in a room with like me or
like, not just like, I'm not trying to put
[SPEAKER_02]: myself on some pedestal, but I'm just
saying you sit down with someone that's
[SPEAKER_02]: been in weed for their entire life and in
these various circles and in these various
[SPEAKER_02]: groups and knows a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can either talk the talk or you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and the thing that, again,
I emphasize this almost on every episode,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it used to be more clear to everyone
that these people that would sell these
[SPEAKER_01]: people on these ideas that they,
Hey, I've got this rare, rare cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really easy to then for a person to
go, Hey, there's X amount of people with
[SPEAKER_01]: this cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this guy have this cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a liar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's boot him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some reason, like I said,
the disconnect's gotten further and
[SPEAKER_01]: further and further, and we need to try to
seal that up somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those things where,
it's one of those things where like,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you in the normal world, let's say that
like you want to hire an accountant,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can go look at their resume and you
can see that they went to school for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got accredited by that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They passed this test or this board.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually like a bonded or
licensed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think about like even being a
contractor with a contractor license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and a bond where like they have
insurance in case they mess up your,
[SPEAKER_02]: your house or something, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing, there's nothing like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that trade style or accreditation
style yet with candidates, because we all
[SPEAKER_02]: come out of the shadows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody, everybody can just be like,
I, I'm good at talking and faking it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and a lot of the times when I've
been, you know, when I've tried to consult
[SPEAKER_02]: for people, one of the most frustrating
things is you give them good advice and
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't want to listen to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they, or they don't know who to listen
to or they're getting conflicting advice
[SPEAKER_02]: and they don't have the intelligence,
not the intelligence.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the wrong word.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have the knowledge of the scene
they're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: To know which advice is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis super hard to do research in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost said intelligence, but
intelligence isn't the right word because
[SPEAKER_02]: they could be super intelligent and
knowledgeable about other areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just, they're just ignorant about
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that ignorance get used against them
because then it goes into like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, who sounds good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, who puts themselves forward the
most, who raises their hands and has the
[SPEAKER_01]: best marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who has it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, most of the people that ran
towards the money first in 2018,
[SPEAKER_02]: 2019, they were like, we want to get rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go sell our story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of those people ended up
bouncing around because they'd ends up,
[SPEAKER_02]: they, they sell their story, but then a
year, year and a half, two years into it,
[SPEAKER_02]: they get fired because they weren't able
to deliver.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've seen projects that are on
like their fifth management group in six
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, and that's like, they fire people
cause they, they're like, oh, this,
[SPEAKER_02]: these people aren't it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they hire more people that aren't
it because they don't have a framework for
[SPEAKER_02]: how to, for how to tell.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's it for this week.
