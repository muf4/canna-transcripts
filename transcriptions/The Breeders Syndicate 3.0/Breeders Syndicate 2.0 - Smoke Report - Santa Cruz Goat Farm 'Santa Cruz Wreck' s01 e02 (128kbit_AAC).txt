[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_00]: clan-destined scene through the eyes of
the folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-so-dog, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate strain
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we will be reviewing Santa Cruz Goat
Farms' Santa Cruz Rec, a hybrid of Santa
[SPEAKER_00]: Cruz Blue Dream and Arcada Train Rec.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I should start by saying if I
had, you know, a top 10 list of desert
[SPEAKER_00]: island strains, Santa Cruz Blue Dream Cut
and Arcada Train Rec would probably be
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere in that list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I first heard Santa Cruz Goat Farm
was doing a hybrid of the Santa Cruz Blue
[SPEAKER_00]: Dream Cut and the Arcada Train Rec,
first off I was like, how do you know
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got the Santa Cruz Blue Dream?
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted, he's from Santa Cruz,
but in many, many years I haven't seen
[SPEAKER_00]: that exact specific cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long time since I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's pretty confident.
[SPEAKER_00]: He showed me some pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks right, but a lot of the Santa
Cruz Blue Dream stuff looks identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you go to smoke it, it's way
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scent profile is drastically
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the quality of the high is drastically
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm always skeptical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the first time in years,
someone delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has the Santa Cruz Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought me a butt of it pure and
hybrids and all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of that is what I'm reviewing
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Santa Cruz Rec.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hybrid of Arcada Train Rec and the
Santa Cruz Blue Dream Cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Santa Cruz Blue Dream Cut was a Super
Silver Haze and DJ Blueberry cut hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a very specific selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the original Santa Cruz
Blue Dream was a little bit of berry,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of turpentine and a lot of
complexity, almost like dryer sheets,
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of weird, beautiful notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to give this a crack and see
what we smell upon first crack here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has the dryer sheet smell of Blue
Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I would call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely smell some berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely smell a little bit of
turpentine because it's a hybrid of Train
[SPEAKER_00]: Rec and Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so strong on the lemon in this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is some seriously beautiful bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's not like Cookie's density,
but it's still got good density like Blue
[SPEAKER_00]: Dream had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Train Rec usually brings a little bit of
looseness to the hybrids that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really didn't impact the density of
this bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very resinous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, Train Rec brings a lot of resin,
more resin than people are accustomed to
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing to in narrow leaf type plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Blue Dream as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mega resin bomb for a narrow leaf plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two combined made for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exceptional.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many smells deep in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a low cotton candy smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best smell when you're standing next
to a wall that has a dryer and dryer
[SPEAKER_00]: sheets are in it and it's blowing the air
out with some berry and turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so hard to describe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be one of the more complex things
that I've tried to describe on here now so
[SPEAKER_00]: far, which there aren't a lot yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's one of the harder ones I've
always had at time describing Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to break it up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's breaking up real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still super sticky like all of Santa
Cruz Goat Farms weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cured super sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this is a three month cure on
this and it is still super sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like at risk of molding or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just really, really resinous and
sticky and cured perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like breaking up to dust in my
fingers like a lot of weed does that's
[SPEAKER_00]: improperly cured or dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is proper shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So props to him on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll give you a flavor report here in
one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked a little bit of it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few days ago and it's my go to right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that says anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already have some popped running in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want this cut of it too because
this is fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'll give it a burn here and see
how it tastes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like an explosion of fruit dry sheets
because that dry sheet taste comes through
[SPEAKER_00]: so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful, happy, like real
flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not soapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can taste the berry on the back end a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't taste as heavy as terpenolene
as you would think for a hybrid of Blue
[SPEAKER_00]: Dream and Trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting a lot of the fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is special.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is special.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high again reminds me a lot of the
Silver Pearl from Ohio that Pipsweed
[SPEAKER_00]: brought to the table to our crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's definitely one of my top fives as
far as high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just got the best quality high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of making me chatty, a little
obnoxious, not feeling tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not feeling it behind my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling it more in my chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love a good, clear headed, chatty,
what people would traditionally call a
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa type high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, this is a solid six out of five.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot that I get in smoke
where I'm just mind blown by it and where
[SPEAKER_00]: I want more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I pop it immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of those rare occasions
where I want to work it into the bonnet
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do some stuff with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even more so than just the straight
Santa Cruz Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, be sure to check it out.
