[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_01]: counterculture that is Canna.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_01]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be joined by members of the Canna
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_01]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mission is to combat the narrative of
the corporate cannabis industry and seed
[SPEAKER_01]: posers are obfuscating for their own
financial benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here with Thousandfold, and we have
some other guests with us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today, we are going to be talking
about the vegetative situation,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct, Thousand?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you can word it better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just going to broadly talk about the
vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have talked about growing indoors in
general, obviously, but I thought we could
[SPEAKER_06]: focus in on things like germination,
seedling care, cloning, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also just, yeah, Pharma Dan tried to get
us demonetized right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Instantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just start with, I'm coming.
There he comes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought to get us warmed up,
even though you guys have all told us
[SPEAKER_06]: about your setups, I thought for this
episode, you may as well just briefly tell
[SPEAKER_06]: us about your setups again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe start with local, just broadly
local.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't have to extravagant of a grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a nice size closet that I use for
veg.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a storage rack in there that I use
so I can keep my solo moms and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then off to the sides, I'll keep full
size moms just so I can actively take cuts
[SPEAKER_05]: off of them and then cycle through stuff
that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of my first year in the setup
because I've moved.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's been working pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still trying to get used to the
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like in flower, I have a five by five.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grow under LED lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I kind of just grow mainly using
one gallon pots and let them rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll go right after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My setup's very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of a closet, it's a two by four
tent with a rack in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just kind of use that for different
things, popping seeds and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just general veg stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a big veg tent that I sometimes,
I don't know, it's kind of like my in
[SPEAKER_00]: between flower and veg tent area where I
will get, I'll transition plants into
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger pots and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will vent that tent into my little
two by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have any actual, any fans in
there sucking anything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit of passive air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of keep it nice and humid in
there and let them hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty similar to what I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: For my veg setup, I just have a little two
by four.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's connected to my four by four with a
duct.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it passively pulls through it when
it's exhausting through the tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so yeah, just a little two,
two shelf can pop some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Half the time I have to clear it out to
dry in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's tenuous, but I just bought a
house.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping to build out a nice framed
room, like a real working space again
[SPEAKER_03]: soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's kind of one of the main
reasons why I dry in the fridge is because
[SPEAKER_06]: otherwise I'd have to use the grow space,
which I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can still try that out, especially now,
once I have my new space, I'll have room
[SPEAKER_03]: for a second fridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like just for drying weed,
holding seeds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait for you to get more room so
we can see all the weird experiments
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man, like I want to do all kinds of
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, what can I afford to like
do realistically off the bat?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like I want to do like a enough
space for like a four by eight,
[SPEAKER_03]: like 2000 watt or like a two LED fixture
set up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually start moving through some
populations again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, I tend to like drain to waste
cocoa like I'm always running containers,
[SPEAKER_02]: drain to waste cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I've always done it,
because most of the time I was renting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you couldn't really be like the first
time I was trying to run flood and drain
[SPEAKER_02]: tables and apartments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you have like an emergency
situation and they want to have a 24 hour
[SPEAKER_02]: inspection, that that's a that's a death
note.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I learned that really quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just went to drain to waste cocoa,
drain to waste cocoa, peat moss,
[SPEAKER_02]: perlite mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you go outdoors now, Matt?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, that's the way I did it
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: This this round, too, was very,
very shittily trying to apply indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques to outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that didn't work so well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do the much bigger pots and
probably preamended soil as opposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to go right in the ground,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see you do like like a bajillion
little one footers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, like everybody start them in
like fucking August 1st.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a little like 10 inch seedling
and then just like grid them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I just think about like it's
possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I model with like a little space,
you know what I mean, where you're
[SPEAKER_03]: cramming tons of small plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the whatever you got.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so have you guys seen that Instagram
page stunted dot art?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I showed it to CSI the other day and he
was tripping out to like it's basically
[SPEAKER_02]: these buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call them bud sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they were calling them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like solo kept growing,
but they're literally like six inches
[SPEAKER_02]: tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just like a big old fat bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like they have it all gridded out
with 30 of them just like fat everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's really respectful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're actually growing really
well in these little tiny cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's it's decent bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks exactly what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all in how they train it on how
they they do it, how they fired off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I if I ever try to force myself to
run like six to eight, that's what I would
[SPEAKER_06]: have to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they've got it down to a science.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just cool to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And did you want to add anything?
[SPEAKER_06]: I cut you off earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was going to say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt was saying I do drain device as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just didn't mention like medium or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's I think I think quite a few of
us do like drain device.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, same.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do I do ProMix, which is the peat
mosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the ProMix HP.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, how about we move on to
germination?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wanted to ask him this one,
partly because it's I think I'm very good
[SPEAKER_06]: at telling us about like his journey when
he was first learning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I because germination is one of those
topics that has like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_06]: everyone has their own opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm gonna be a Nazi on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna let you guys go all before I rip
it all apart.
[SPEAKER_06]: His opinions for sure very opinionated on
this specific one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And tell us about like, what, you know,
what you first tried, what was like what
[SPEAKER_06]: you read about online, maybe that kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I remembered, I mean,
when I was in elementary school,
[SPEAKER_00]: we learned how to germinate lima beans,
putting them in a paper towel and a paper
[SPEAKER_00]: in a plastic baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did that, you know, that's how I knew
how to germinate seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like sometimes I would dampen them
off by leaving in there too long or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I then I started reading about how
you needed to use like, maybe it would
[SPEAKER_00]: help to have like a heat mat, you know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started thinking, man, I need a heat
mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started the first time I did that,
I had like a plate and a wet paper towel
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was sitting in there and I left it
overnight with no paper bag or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just dried, killed all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I was like, that was stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I thought that would
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put a bag on it the next time
thinking this is going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also dried it out somehow because those
plastic baggies are not like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously impervious to moisture loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it dried out, killed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I was like, all right,
look, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to be doing the heat mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously I'm killing a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up just started, like I soaked
mine for 24 hours, like in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I don't like push them under the
water or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally just like float them on top of
some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They float for like 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a look and just make sure that they
look like they're kind of opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do any kind of weird seed cracking
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to just put them, I take them and
put them straight into my, I use like a,
[SPEAKER_00]: just my cocoa and just put them straight
in there, water it with a really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really light nutrient solution and like
the same stuff that I use for my clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just direct them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and that's, and I will say that's
been really successful for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have really good germination rates
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't have, I don't tend to,
I just, for me, I feel like the more I
[SPEAKER_00]: mess with it, the more I tend to like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Scout's got opinions too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to say that learning how
to germinate seeds when you're in school
[SPEAKER_06]: for me was one of the most magical things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like looking back, it kind of really
stands out in my mind as like,
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still so cool to me that like you
plant this little thing and then a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of weeks later you have like this root
ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how fast it all happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean the tick, like look at the tick of
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's, it's amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Little interjection.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's next?
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I really like, um, sprouting in like a
real kind of soil blend if I can,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, especially if it's going to go
outdoor, I kind of like to have it in more
[SPEAKER_03]: of like a real, like where it's going to
end up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't really like going from like
a inert media to then like a living,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, like a hundred gallon smart pot or
something like that, that you've been
[SPEAKER_03]: amending for years and like has its own
biology going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, um, I've done a bunch of stuff of
like direct sowing, like right into the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil too, like actual like mineral soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the plants blow up so quick and
they're so happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but then like birds eat them and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, uh, when I'm growing inside,
I, uh, um, always just start in my pro mix
[SPEAKER_03]: and, um, occasionally if I'm like really
like at the rare seeds or something that I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want to lose, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Erne was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'll soak them in a little bit of
peroxide, um, let them just like open up
[SPEAKER_03]: and just shoot that tail out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll put them immediately into
the media.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that way you can like, you know,
put them in upside down, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_03]: or like how the shell opens up,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: That comes up and then you have the two
cotyledons that come out of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can definitely put your
seedlings in the ground and then have like
[SPEAKER_03]: a root just pop right up, you know,
and then everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's completely inverted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, um, I don't really do anything
that special.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like to go right into the soil as
soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, local Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, one thing that I kind of always do
with my seeds is give them a bath in H2O2,
[SPEAKER_05]: a hydrogen peroxide, 3%, about two
minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then after that, I mean,
recently I've kind of been choosing to
[SPEAKER_05]: soak my seeds for 24 hours and they
usually crack by then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'll move them to the, um,
into like a moist paper towel.
[SPEAKER_05]: After that, um, just cause I, I'm like
kind of anal about checking the progress,
[SPEAKER_05]: not, not like checking it every day,
but being able to have eyes on,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, what's my seed doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then once I kind of see that
taproot, like actually like stick out,
[SPEAKER_05]: stick out, I'll just move it to cocoa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but yeah, um, other than that,
that's kind of what I go through.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, everything's been relative.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't done any fancy germ tags and
shit like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to actually, I wanted to kind
of prompt something around the paper towel
[SPEAKER_06]: method and to a degree, also the soaking
method.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess one benefit is that you get some
additional information before you,
[SPEAKER_06]: so you, so, um, so at least, you know,
whether or not the seed cracked,
[SPEAKER_06]: whether there was a taproot before it goes
in, that's one advantage I can see.
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally, I just like soaking and
sewing without even using the seed crack
[SPEAKER_06]: or the taproot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but yeah, I think that's obviously
one, one quite big benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I guess I can also add every time you
open that towel, you are risking something
[SPEAKER_05]: entering, you know, so it's not ideal to
check it, but like you said, it's one of
[SPEAKER_05]: the advantages.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's not like I'm looking every
fucking 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's once every other day I've changed
the towel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, after that, I mean, after a few days,
you can kind of see like little spots of
[SPEAKER_05]: mold sometimes if you've left it orange
and brown.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, paper towel is just like a
prime medium for any kind of mold or
[SPEAKER_05]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, that's kind of why I moved away
from that is I started like, I would get
[SPEAKER_03]: busy or something and you leave them in 24
hours too long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then suddenly they, you start having
losses over that mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now, now what I will point out is that
a lot of you guys, what you're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about is popping modern new seeds and that
all these are perfect for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, during the time when I was learning
how to pop, a lot of seeds were very old
[SPEAKER_02]: that were being sold by the Dutch as
their, their seed stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was learning on a lot of really old
seeds and they were still really
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like, you know, uh, the pack of
blueberries, $350 DJ short, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the sensei seats, like,
uh, Jack Herrera, again, $300.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they're all kinds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were spending lots of money on these
seeds and it wasn't like it was like a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of people would use this argument that in
nature, that trees drop their own seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: and they sprout on their own in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a tree generally speaking,
if it's getting pollinated, a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, it's dropping tens of thousands of
seeds for one to grow in that spot,
[SPEAKER_02]: ultimately to grow under it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it's not a really good odd system
to be playing if you're spending hundreds
[SPEAKER_02]: of dollars on seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I learned early on was to be as
sterile as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was just for making all kinds of
mistakes using people's like hippie voodoo
[SPEAKER_02]: powder, you know, saying, Oh, this,
this, you know, humic acid's great,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, wash your seeds in this,
dip them in this, you know, all that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all I saw was just infection,
uh, seeds not popping.
[SPEAKER_02]: They start stall out mushiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's when I started looking into
using the hydrogen peroxide wash for seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: first, because I was thinking,
okay, a lot of these seeds are coming from
[SPEAKER_02]: like a PM environment, like no doubt,
like some people are going to sell seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: from PM environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to clean off that husk first
before I put in anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second thing I want to do is wash the hell
out of my hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people dig in their ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's your nose, scratch your fucking
head, you know, all day touching
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people forget like how
important it is to wash your damn hands
[SPEAKER_02]: before you start messing with something
where you're going to bring, you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to want like, um, an anaerobic
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Local?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the right word?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anaerobic environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want it to be as sterile as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just sterile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean sterile, you want to sterile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, you know, if your hands are dirty,
that's a, you're already introducing
[SPEAKER_02]: issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you, if you've, if you've washed it
in H2O2 solution, a light one,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, wash the outside, I like to dip my
paper towel in a, uh, uh, mixture of H2O2
[SPEAKER_02]: and water, but a lot lighter than I would
when I wash the actual seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I wring it out because the other
important part is the consistency of the
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture in the paper towel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want it sopping wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want your, your seed to have to work
to get to the water outside of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and then there's other, other cases
where like people give up on seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it's really just a really thick,
healthy shell and no, no moisture is able
[SPEAKER_02]: to enter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's certain things I do like hand
cracking seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, sometimes if they're really old seeds,
I'll hand crack ahead of time so that they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have to use a lot of the stored
energy or whatever's left of the stored
[SPEAKER_02]: energy in their shell to work,
to break open that shell and do all that
[SPEAKER_02]: process just to try to help it have enough
energy to get out easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, another thing I do is I like to hang
the plastic bags in the backside of a
[SPEAKER_02]: cupboard door, like, so it's dark where
it's at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to hang them, uh, using like tape.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tape them to the backside of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just so like, it acts like
gravity and pulls the seedling taproot
[SPEAKER_02]: downwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's important for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like trying to plant something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, it's all curly, cute.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it annoying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't, you know, you want to plant it
nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that just makes it easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, another thing that I do, it's a lot
different from people is I let the
[SPEAKER_02]: seedling grow until I see the green
cotyledons, um, in, in the actual baggie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't immediately plant it the first
second I see a taproot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main reason for that is because I,
I want the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If, if something does, um, in fact,
like whether it's from the cocoa,
[SPEAKER_02]: the medium, wherever in between planting
it and getting it in there, if something
[SPEAKER_02]: does start to attack the root zone,
I want to be able to feed it from the top
[SPEAKER_02]: from its, from its actual leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the true leaves are just about to pop
up at that point, if you wait that long.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just another reason that I like
to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like ultimately giving that
seedling the ultimate chance to make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just from learning on old seeds
and having a lot of rare strains and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and having to play the odds games of,
okay, there's four of these seeds that we
[SPEAKER_02]: have left on earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all of them need to make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all really old.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the best way to do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like, I always use that method
on even new seeds, just because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: become a force of habit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's, that's, uh, really where I
like to take that, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's other things you do, like your
relic acid treatments and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I, I highly don't recommend doing that
because it, it may, it gives other issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I wouldn't do that unless I absolutely
had to with old seeds, but everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: should know how to do it if they ever have
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's as far as that's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I, I had a question about like how
long you could leave them, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: in like paper towels or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I thought maybe you were,
you can leave them in there a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times like the, the tap roots and
will grow into the paper towels and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just kind of gently tear it apart
real slowly, you know, move it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, it's, it's,
I like, I like making sure that I have a
[SPEAKER_02]: fully established plant in the cleanest
environment possible before I put it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's essentially it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, would you mind elaborating a little
bit on like what it actually takes to
[SPEAKER_06]: crack, uh, these with big shells?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you've, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, so like I would use, let me see if
I can have a pair here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I like to do is use really small,
really sharp scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have these fiskers or whatever
they're called on, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are singer ones, um, on Amazon,
I think like five bucks a piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really small, really sharp and
precise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can actually have really,
really tight motion of movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can feel when the seed,
the shell actually is penetrated because
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because, because they're small and you
have really precise movement of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can stop before you then cut the
embryo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause once you, once you've cut the
embryo, you're killing the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, or the seedling inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you only want to do enough to gently
penetrate the shell enough for water to
[SPEAKER_02]: get in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's easy enough to do with like
match books and like rubbing the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the seedling against a match book
covering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people have luck with that and
that'll be enough, but I've always had a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of luck with these.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, those techniques freak me out.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know that like you had to do it for
some, you know, under some conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've just never done it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, with the, with the very first
round of the clockwork orange S ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of people had to learn how to do
hand cracking because it was just the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the seeds were fucking vigorous as
hell, but you had to get water in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were just so the shell was so
thick and healthy that you had to crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to do it to get them in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It only happened one round, but I have
seen cases where like really healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I've seen it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see a lot of people throw away seeds
like they don't pop and they don't even
[SPEAKER_02]: look at why they're not popping.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like, Oh no bummer seed,
uh, shitty breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens, but I like to make people
aware that maybe they should try that
[SPEAKER_02]: before they, uh, totally give up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and back to the sterile part,
like when I'm leaving him in these,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, these bags sometimes for up to 10
days, like to fully form these seedlings
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I changed the paper towel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime that I check it to open it,
I change it instantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I change it every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I do it often every three days,
at least I change that paper towel,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether I'm checking it or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I have to change it because you,
you just want to keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, this is, this is making me realize
that if I were smart, this whole episode
[SPEAKER_06]: would just be germination.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we could have gotten like five
episodes from this, but oh well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I covered it pretty well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was just going to say,
like, I had never really thought about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember hearing you talk about it,
I think on your cracker, the video where
[SPEAKER_03]: you talk about cracking seeds and you talk
about like, cleanliness and it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd never like, I always think about it as
far as like, well, I don't want to be
[SPEAKER_03]: extremely dirty, but I had never gone as
far as just like literally the oils on
[SPEAKER_03]: your skin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't touch your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like avoid all those types of motions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're working like, it's how you
have to be when you work in a tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like applying those principles to
even just those initial steps,
[SPEAKER_03]: like helps a lot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I also have, I was thinking while you
were talking about the gibberellic acid,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, we should play around with
other more gentle cytokinins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause there's definitely a bunch of others
that like induce cell elongation and like
[SPEAKER_03]: stem growth and all those things that may
actually work a lot better than
[SPEAKER_03]: gibberellic acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's so like active in such minute
quantities.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I try to tell people like,
um, I get, I get a lot of questions about
[SPEAKER_02]: using gibberellic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first thing I'll tell people is,
do you actually need to use it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are you just assuming you need to use
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if it's not old, old, old seeds
that are already having trouble popping,
[SPEAKER_02]: do not use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it, because what it does is it
causes the seedling to like be like a two
[SPEAKER_02]: foot tall seedling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just picture that like, like barely true
leaves coming out and having a two foot
[SPEAKER_02]: tall seedling that you have to stake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it tries to grow taller from that
and elongate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes a few months for the,
the gibberellic acid to stop being so
[SPEAKER_02]: active.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're like trying to grow a solid
plant on top of taffy bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're trying to clone off as fast as
you can, you know, so you don't use it
[SPEAKER_02]: unless you fully have to and understand
what you're using for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, funny enough, they actually found that
gibberellic acid number three,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, from some kind of rice fungus or a
fungus that would infect rice and cause
[SPEAKER_05]: rice to elongate a lot more than it would,
but they found it, I believe beneficial
[SPEAKER_05]: and then began to synthesize it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there's like 60 something different
forms of gibberellic acid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've talked about three.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number three is the, is the one that like
is almost always used.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the other ones I've never tried the
other ones, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even think they're commercially
available like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I heard number 20 is the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 20 was popping, but yeah,
just a little fun fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They called it a foolish rice syndrome
when they were first discovering it
[SPEAKER_03]: because they would, they would elongate so
tall and collapse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the plant would die.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what weed does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it elongates and then folds over on
itself like taffy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have seen photos of, uh, cannabis plants
that have like stretched themselves to
[SPEAKER_06]: death.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something kind of abject about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes too, like I did, this just
happened to me recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was popping a bunch of,
uh, OGS ones and we only got like 50% germ
[SPEAKER_03]: rate, but the seeds were like fully
beautifully developed, like still that
[SPEAKER_03]: nice, rich tiger stripe on it and
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I cracked a bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they just wouldn't go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so just cause you like get a seed and
it looks great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't, doesn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had white seed that pops pretty high
rate too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had, um, what are my early, early rounds
with the SR 71 purple Kush?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I made a big bag of fem seed S ones
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I was going to be rolling in
bank cause this is like 2009.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Money, you know, purple push S ones and
not a goddamn one would pop and they
[SPEAKER_02]: looked so healthy and so nice and
non-reviable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you kind of lifted them,
you realize that there, there probably
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't a solid developed embryo because
they just didn't have that heft that they
[SPEAKER_02]: needed, but they looked perfect and they
weren't soft and you couldn't like hand
[SPEAKER_02]: crack them, you know, it sucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know, uh, CSI has run into it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just one of those things where you
just don't know it's going to happen until
[SPEAKER_02]: it happens or why it happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, are you like referring specifically to
fem seed or would that ever happen in a
[SPEAKER_05]: red case?
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's only been fence where I would
kind of inbred fence too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never had it happen with regs ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think CSI has either for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It pops up occasionally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if I popped 15 different like fem
hybrids, like maybe one, um, if it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrid out of all of those, and that's not
even every round, it's like every other
[SPEAKER_03]: round or maybe more, but the, like the S
one stuff, especially like the OGs,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just like, it's already inbred and
then you just inbred it further.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, even the ones that pop,
like they're runty little messes,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, fascinating stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd probably come back to this since,
uh, to some degree, uh, at the end,
[SPEAKER_06]: cause we're going to talk about tissue
culture, which, you know, there's going to
[SPEAKER_06]: be some overlap.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one thing I did want to touch on
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it is going into this and it
was only, um, maybe, maybe I'll wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just something that earn mentioned
briefly about giving seedlings nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we could touch on that whenever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're about to go into seed link here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and just before I, I'm going to hand
this to Dan, but just before we start,
[SPEAKER_06]: like why I think this is cool to talk
about is that it's just that awkward
[SPEAKER_06]: period of like the first one or two weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think when I look it up,
people don't write that much about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it's not well known.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan, do you want to start us off?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I'd say like the number one thing
I'm always like watching and like looking
[SPEAKER_03]: for regardless of any setup or anything,
it's just those initial dry backs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you really don't want to keep that
young seedling oversaturated.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want it to have like a nice aerobic
medium to move through and have healthy
[SPEAKER_03]: roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, if you don't see roots hitting
the edge of like, you know, a three inch
[SPEAKER_03]: pot by the end of like the second week,
like you, you probably overwatering,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, um, especially in cocoa,
I see it because it's like, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: Coco's dry backs are kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I never used to like to let it get
like where the color changes on the cocoa,
[SPEAKER_03]: but like you still want it to be light,
you know, and, and not like keeping it too
[SPEAKER_03]: wet all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I kind of like moved away
from it for the pro mix is, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: like it's kind of the same thing,
I guess, but like I just have,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's, it's got a larger margin of error
and I'm curious about these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so, um, but I would really be
looking at like what media you're starting
[SPEAKER_03]: in because like there's a lot of soil
blends, especially if you're in soil that
[SPEAKER_03]: come with fertilizer in it and you don't
need to give it hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you're in the like Kings mix or
the, um, I forget what it's called.
[SPEAKER_03]: The green bag of the Royal goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, ocean forest is another, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ocean forest has probably got two to four
weeks of food in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, um, but, so I don't really normally
start with very much food at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll probably do like my, like I'm on
cutting edge and so I'll just throw a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of edge, like literally like
200 or 300 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I'll even then water it down a
little more from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it to be really light for those
first few, um, um, but then I occasionally
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll throw in like some additives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I really like the primordial
solution, sea green.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good for everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a compost tea extract,
uh, fish, fish and kelp based.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you follow your spray plants with
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like, they fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a, it's got enough food in it
too, where you could literally just do
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also had really good results with
mills starter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't really know what that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a kelp based nitro feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's like a six zero zero,
but you're only adding like a few MLS a
[SPEAKER_03]: gallon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he's the bills, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also used super thrive in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of like an old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like soup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do people shit on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's a, it's technically a PGR,
but like the old dude who ran suit,
[SPEAKER_02]: who like created super thrive,
he was, he would go like, and talk to
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone who bought his shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wanted to talk to break down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That could, that dude was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, um, I hate when people use PGR,
you PGR.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just like, dude, there's,
it's so rare to see anyone like,
[SPEAKER_03]: like nobody has protocols for like I
spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next is a PGR, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a PGR.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rooting hormone is loaded with like a
hundred, I think it's like 80 to a few
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred different, like minute quantities
of different PGRs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's, it's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them are naturally occurring.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like, if you use kelp, you're kind
of using PGRs.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just naturally derived.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's like, if you're using salts,
then like, what the fuck do you care?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I just imagine how many people are
using Clonox shedding on PGRs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, well, I'm pretty sure
Clonox has some sort of an antimicrobial
[SPEAKER_03]: in it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like, I know I've seen other like
organic quote unquote or more all natural
[SPEAKER_03]: rooting gels and, uh, they, uh,
yeah, we can get into this in the next one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the later topics, but I just think that
that's so funny when people get caught up
[SPEAKER_03]: on the PGR thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like even at commercial scale,
like nobody, if it's not like a commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: weed product, then we don't even know,
or like, then no one's doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like no one's like blending custom blends
of phyto hormones and like, like spraying
[SPEAKER_03]: them on the plants and has done the R and
D to like, see like, oh, well this makes
[SPEAKER_03]: the buds bigger, but doesn't affect
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, um, that used to be like packwood
butyra's all back in the day and the like
[SPEAKER_03]: bush load and shit to keep the plant
short.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but anyway, back to the main topic
seedling care.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I just try and do really low and
slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've definitely been that idiot that puts
like, you know, I don't know, like eight
[SPEAKER_03]: or 900 PPM and just like fry stuff right
off the bat or like, like over amends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I like to throw a little bit of a,
an all purpose like dry amendment into my
[SPEAKER_03]: pro mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've definitely over amended that
before to, um, blend big batches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't blend like top dress little pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't, you can't measure the quantity
you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just going to kill your shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I've actually probably killed more
seedlings at this stage than fucked up
[SPEAKER_03]: germinations for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also a klutz.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I always kill one just by like,
you know, falling on it or by existing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just existing around the plants and like
somehow one of them gets just fucking dead
[SPEAKER_03]: headed right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, anyways, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck that plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, to me it was always incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like how little water they do need at that
stage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I started with like a dropper and
then sometimes they don't, I don't,
[SPEAKER_06]: they don't need anything for like over a
week.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Aaron, what are your thoughts on,
uh, what's your vibe with early seedling
[SPEAKER_06]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so I direct, so they pop I'm in
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, sometimes I'll use like pro
mix or I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I'm at the hydro store and like
some, some, some soil that I'm in that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: okay with is on sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get it and use it for, to start seeds
with, you know, um, like recently I have
[SPEAKER_00]: some nectar for the God soil that they
have on sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so I've started something there,
but basically like if, if I start,
[SPEAKER_00]: so if I start seeds in soil that's
amended, I won't, I won't give them any
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just will give them plain water and
like, I'll give them a little bit of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, some kind of beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so like I use like the VAM and dough
mix or whatever, you know, my go,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll just give a little bit of that,
give them a little bit of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I'm in cut my cocoa, then I use,
I mean, I use Kana A and B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll mix it very, very light,
like super light, you know, like I,
[SPEAKER_00]: I measure it with the, I use a pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's like, some people love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people hate them, but I use a,
you know, a PPM pen and I'll mix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my water comes out at like zero,
like 20 PPM, like super duper low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm, when I'm talking,
when I mix something light, I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: like 200 PPM maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I feed that just because they're
in, you know, cocoa and cocoa has nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, otherwise I just try to make
sure they dry back really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, that's, I focus more on stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I focus more on good watering practices
and just making sure that I'm not like
[SPEAKER_00]: overwatering at that stage, um,
more so than the food and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's probably not like,
you could probably go without it for a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit and be okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will spray it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're little I'll spray water on
them instead of just like pouring it in
[SPEAKER_00]: there because like, I don't know,
cocoa is really easy to like wash it out
[SPEAKER_00]: and just like really destroy like where
the roots growing and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just like to spray it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little more gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not flooding it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really good call.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I used to do that when I was doing
big, like, you know, hundreds and hundreds
[SPEAKER_03]: of seedlings.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's way easier to get in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: With like a two gallon sprayer and just
missed overhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will inevitably pour a little bit too
much water and then like, see the
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings start like floating around or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably not good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, yeah, I don't have much,
uh, different to say, um, it is a lot of,
[SPEAKER_05]: or a lot of it is in watering practices.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, most of my buck ups with seedlings
have been because I've watered them too
[SPEAKER_05]: much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And since the roots small, they can't
drink your dry backs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not going to be as big, assuming that
you're not running extremely high temps or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, in terms of feed, I mean, I'll take a,
like a small amount of my main feed that I
[SPEAKER_05]: use for my veg plants and then dilute that
into like a two gallon, three gallon
[SPEAKER_05]: bucket that they sell at Menards and use
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but I, don't do that for like the
first few days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I mean, I was always told that those
cotyledons are going to provide your plant
[SPEAKER_05]: with food for like that first week of its
life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so there's, I mean, I don't want to
say there's no need to feed it that early,
[SPEAKER_05]: but if you're in cocoa, you might want to
start earlier rather than when they need
[SPEAKER_05]: feed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you can, shit can go south fast in
cocoa that early, especially if you're not
[SPEAKER_05]: adding food.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but yeah, um, Matt, any, anything to
add Matt?
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, were you going to comment on?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like when it comes to seedlings,
like I just, I really don't believe they
[SPEAKER_02]: need food until the first few weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, usually when, when you start to see it
gently, slowly, like you don't,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't want to let it get yellow,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you start to see the color slightly
change, that's when I start feeding
[SPEAKER_02]: always.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't see a reason to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, and the reason I like to,
to give people that advice, it's most
[SPEAKER_02]: people will always feed, feed in water too
aggressively.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to try to set in the opposite
direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're probably going to end up
hurting the plant more that way,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially for new growers, you know,
and I always assume most people are new
[SPEAKER_02]: growers that are asking questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think that was great.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that might be that little
section might be new to some people,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, just in terms of some of those
considerations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, like you said, especially the newer
growers, um, we can move on to the
[SPEAKER_06]: vegetative stage in general.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and I thought we had to invite local
to start this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, what comes to mind local?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we've got a few, obviously a few
different things you could speak to,
[SPEAKER_06]: but when you think about the vegetative
stage, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What immediately comes to mind?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, that's a tough, not tough question,
but there's a lot that comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I mean, I feel like when you're in
veg, you kind of want to run warmer temps,
[SPEAKER_05]: higher humidity to kind of like,
let your plant know that it's summertime.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, um, I typically like to run my
medium, not a lot more moist than I would
[SPEAKER_05]: in flower, but I wouldn't allow for larger
dry backs in veg, particularly in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and let's see, I mean, I grew a lot of
my stuff in solo cups, if I'm being
[SPEAKER_05]: honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so, I mean, it's just like trying to
cycle through them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, in terms of feed, nothing too special.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just use the Kana A and B like earn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I found that plants and veg aren't
necessarily as sensitive as plants and
[SPEAKER_05]: flower with their veg diet or with their
diet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but again, that's not all strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, for example, Matt's blue resin
dude off the bat, it hated Jack's,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is high in N.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't really separate N from the
calcium.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just had to switch, uh, cause I was
not going to accept a plant that looked
[SPEAKER_05]: like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's, it's not hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also don't want to say it's easy,
but I don't put too much thought in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can, let me rephrase part of this for
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what would you worry about?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there much that you would worry about
worrying and veg?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's a little more specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I guess staying on top of your IPM
broke is like, that's really the only
[SPEAKER_05]: place you can actually actively do your
IPM without, you know, busting the bank,
[SPEAKER_05]: buying insects or.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, relying on insects to figure
your problem out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so yeah, I kind of just like to stay
on top of spraying and veg.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that's honestly kind of why I like veg
a lot though, cause you know, it allows
[SPEAKER_05]: you to fix any errors that may have
occurred, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I also, you know, veg is where my
mom's are at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'm much more lenient about my
flowering plants, getting less water than
[SPEAKER_05]: my veg plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause like there's shit in my veg room
that, you know, it would suck to have to
[SPEAKER_05]: hunt through stuff to find something
similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so yeah, just being shit alive really.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good way to start this topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, can punt it to earn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, uh, a lot of the things I'm
going to echo, I think like I tried to,
[SPEAKER_00]: for my veg face, like I'm okay with the,
the temperature and humidity riding a
[SPEAKER_00]: little higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like for me specifically, just to like
say kind of where I am, like with lights
[SPEAKER_00]: on, a lot of times I'll be like around
like 80, 82 degrees, um, in my tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll let my humidity ride up into like
the sixties a bit, you know, I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: like the VPD thing is kind of like a joke
sometimes, you know, like it's made into a
[SPEAKER_00]: meme or whatever, but like using the VPD,
VPD charts like has is what helped me as a
[SPEAKER_00]: beginner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to like, give me an idea of where
a plant needs to be and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm not saying that it's like an
end all be all, but like if you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: starting and you don't really know what
the plant needs, that's like pretty,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that that'll get you in the
ballpark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I kind of will sometimes use,
I don't do it anymore, but when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: starting, I would, you know, really dial
my tents into those numbers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I've noticed that like some
plants do better with low here,
[SPEAKER_00]: lower humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some do with better hot, you know,
it just depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on what you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I think stuff like that gets you
into good ballparks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did want to just say here that,
um, one of the points that you've made in
[SPEAKER_06]: the past, I think is really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not following these numbers
necessarily because they're perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you're, you're paying attention to
them because that way you can calibrate
[SPEAKER_06]: your own grow relative to something,
you know, it's actually something you can
[SPEAKER_06]: track.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I'm big on like having something
just a baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to have a baseline,
um, because, uh, you know, if you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of issues or whatever, and you stray
from your baseline and it's kind of easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to point out the issues, you know,
um, so, and I, I do the same thing for
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so like, I think like,
uh, you know, it gets easier the more that
[SPEAKER_00]: you do it, you know, just looking at your
plants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, I, that's always going to be
the thing that I say is repetition,
[SPEAKER_00]: repetition, repetition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the only thing that's made me
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I, I agree with you.
I agree with you.
I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: With like what local was saying earlier,
I like to try and, uh, I turn off any like
[SPEAKER_03]: Dehu I really have going and, um,
uh, really try and just like, like
[SPEAKER_03]: normally I think my relative humidity is
kind of in like, like 60, 65.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of that range.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, where when I'm flowering, I try and
keep it like 45 to 55, but I've seen
[SPEAKER_03]: people go up to like 70, 75% and their
plants look great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, for my lighting, I definitely,
um, kind of as their seedlings,
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually have it dimmed down and dropped
on top of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have led bars.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the four by four grid space for
my tent too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I kind of just dropped the whole
thing down, um, start at like 20% and then
[SPEAKER_03]: as they are growing up, my, most of the
time I'm vegging at about 50%,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, power on those LEDs and, um,
that way it stays nice and cool too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's don't have to run AC really ever,
um, power bills cheap for those veg
[SPEAKER_03]: months, um, uh, feeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And watering, like I'm just like normal,
like cutting edge and a nice veg powder
[SPEAKER_03]: that I kind of just sprinkle a little top
dressing on the top of the pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm feeding around a thousand PPM
of like a veg and micro mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I mainly use sulfur, um,
but you have to wait, don't spray sulfur
[SPEAKER_03]: too strong on some like fresh young
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will all die.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I kind of wait till they're,
I don't know, like basically toward the
[SPEAKER_03]: size that you could take a clone off of
it, like a single top cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's when I kind of start my IPM
routine and, uh, at sulfur pyrethrin mix,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, just to keep anything at bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an issue with thrips in my area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I kind of always end up with
thrips if I stop doing the sulfur.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, uh, yeah, I don't, nothing,
nothing crazy special, but, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: I love veg too, cause I like, I like moms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like keeping, keeping them around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And keeping them nice and healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, um, I have a one mom in particular
that's just like never happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's been my mission to figure out
exactly what she likes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I still don't know, but she
apparently not too much nitrogen that that
[SPEAKER_03]: helped her too, but she's got these purple
stems and just hates the led.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, like mom health and all that is
its own whole thing too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you can have stuff from different
eras, completely different lines and
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to keep them all happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's a pain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to ask local, if you'd be willing
to speak on, um, his recent experience
[SPEAKER_06]: using, uh, not, uh, was it potassium
local?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you bumped something to try to get
rid of, uh, the purple or red stems.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you want to speak to that
just cause it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so one thing I've noticed with,
um, Kana is it could lack a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: In potassium.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, now that's just in my grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'm not speaking for like the wine and
its entirety.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but what I've noticed is under LEDs,
your plants get a little hungrier in some
[SPEAKER_05]: departments.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, one of those being potassium.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and it's like, I had no way to
independently manipulate my potassium.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so what I did is I got, um,
potassium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_05]: From MPK it's super cheap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, use almost nothing in weight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but it's just enough to bump.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and what I've noticed is I've,
uh, you know, obviously like within like
[SPEAKER_05]: conjunction of, um, adding phosphorus,
um, you know, you're going to want to bump
[SPEAKER_05]: up your potassium a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and since I was only adding phosphorus
before, you know, my purple streaking was
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Going all the way up the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas when I've started adding this and
flower, um, it's kind of helped mitigate
[SPEAKER_05]: that, uh, quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've also noticed tighter stacks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, my sweet pea, for example,
um, it used to have really large,
[SPEAKER_05]: like really large internal spacing and.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the one input bench change is
bumping up potassium and, uh, it's like
[SPEAKER_05]: almost made it a little more compact,
kind of not like rugged, but just overall
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of decent stature.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I've ran the plant for five times now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I mean, it's doing something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, if man, I'm just remembering your
prompt, but, uh, if anyone has any
[SPEAKER_06]: thoughts on red stems under LEDs and,
uh, you know, any thing you've tried to
[SPEAKER_06]: help mitigate that chuck it in the
comments.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, in fact, you know, any, anything that
we've discussed, you know, seedling care,
[SPEAKER_06]: any of that germination, I'm sure many of
you have opinions.
So.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was saying to this is specifically
for my grow, you know, um, it might not
[SPEAKER_05]: happen to everybody else's grow if they
apply it, but it's just observation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt, anything you wanted to add,
Matt?
[SPEAKER_06]: Over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think you guys all covered that
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's, that's, that's pretty
easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just follow a standard,
uh, regimen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think the only thing I'll add is
a lot of people that I'm learning read by
[SPEAKER_02]: PPM or EC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just like one thing that they're
taking into account or not taking into
[SPEAKER_02]: account is that a lot of these companies
aren't very consistent with the product
[SPEAKER_02]: they're delivering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not homogenous just because it
says guaranteed analysis doesn't mean that
[SPEAKER_02]: there is a guaranteed analysis of your
bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I learned that myself when I was
working with my spray and trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: figuring out how to register it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are just like, Oh yeah,
you can put whatever you want on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, you know, learning that like
illuminated a lot for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's when I started using,
um, very consistent suppliers of,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for a while, house and garden even,
um, kind of went down on their nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, for a while, like they just totally
dropped out of their bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's when I switched to Canada for a
while, but, uh, house and gardens bounced
[SPEAKER_02]: back pretty well, I must say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like both of those and they,
they've been consistent enough over the
[SPEAKER_02]: years that I do know what, like what I'm
feeding them based on the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: milliliters I'm putting in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't really have to second guess
that, but I think a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, maybe don't have that same luxury with
the nutrients they're using all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe take that part into consideration
a little bit too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to thank you for hanging out
