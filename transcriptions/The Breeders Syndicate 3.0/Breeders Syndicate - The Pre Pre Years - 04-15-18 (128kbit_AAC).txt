[SPEAKER_01]: Choose your free seeds wisely,
but every time you know, if you do this
[SPEAKER_01]: every time you're not just gonna get one
packet free seeds I'm gonna be hooking you
[SPEAKER_01]: up as the new lines come out and
everything Because that's how we do our
[SPEAKER_01]: friends that help us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it should be done Yeah, man that was
that was some heavy heavy info and I loved
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it Like I don't know that there's
anyone Smarter in this industry right now
[SPEAKER_01]: than Mooney Yeah All right Thank You mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny Snipes for recording this for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we can upload it to YouTube and
have it live And not just live but
[SPEAKER_01]: recorded post recorded pre-recorded post
recorded for anyone to watch at any time
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, thank you very much See we go gee
So, yeah, I've told you guys about some of
[SPEAKER_01]: my craziness going on with my Landlord and
shit finally have all that settled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's gonna be safe taking care of
I'm really stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I have a bunch of seeded
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are going out of town like with my
father And the other stuff's gonna go
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere else the the veg stuff So I'm
really stoked that it's amazing to have
[SPEAKER_01]: such good friends that are willing to do
stuff like that for me They're deleting
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis channels they can suck my dick
Yeah, we're gonna be having Mooney on more
[SPEAKER_01]: often and probably DSG labs and a few
others I'd like to have on and just Man,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people come to these live feeds
because they want they want to learn they
[SPEAKER_01]: want to learn about breeding and they want
to learn about cannabis in general and You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, there are channels like bubble man's
that talk about s extracts or hash church,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but Yeah, I have to move this
stuff out but As far as breeders go,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's anyone teaching
breeding I really don't and and
[SPEAKER_01]: considering how many people call
themselves breeders You know Mike does
[SPEAKER_01]: some live feeds that are excellent And and
of course there are breeders who are more
[SPEAKER_01]: shy about being on camera and I understand
that because there are some amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders, but He just got banned from
YouTube for 90 days Damn that sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up green dragon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah strain history Tissue culture tech
anything that has to do with breeding or
[SPEAKER_01]: it can help breeding I want to I want to I
want to be the best source of info for
[SPEAKER_01]: that for everyone And when I bring on guys
like Mooney, I'm learning with you guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Can you really teach breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could teach breeding basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could teach breeding terminology.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could teach breeding You could teach
everything except the hands-on stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't teach people how to select you
can't teach people how to properly test
[SPEAKER_01]: their lines Stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to do either You have it
or you don't either you understand the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant or you don't and you cannot teach
ethics exactly bittersweet You can't teach
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding ethics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can try but I can't instill that in
anyone But I can teach you I Can teach you
[SPEAKER_01]: all the basics of breeding words that you
should know, you know turn Terminology and
[SPEAKER_01]: I can give you advice on where to get more
info to learn even further But nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: replaces hands-on approach to breeding and
like I said, you know I've been getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of questions from New up-and-coming
breeders people that are new to everything
[SPEAKER_01]: and they want advice lay down Murray and
they want they want advice on What they
[SPEAKER_01]: should start doing and I gave the advice,
you know If you want to see evolution in
[SPEAKER_01]: action quick and you want to see your
trait selection Is done fast practice on
[SPEAKER_01]: Auto flowers, you know, and I think a lot
of people didn't get the reason why it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just because auto flowers have a quicker
germination to flower to finishing flower
[SPEAKER_01]: Time than anything else so you can get
through several crops very very quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could do it while having your
plants in 24 hours veg if you want Yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing is and I and I say
this from time to time Learn the base
[SPEAKER_01]: lines learn the base lines if you want to
become a full and complete breeder to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to Recognize those base lines and
other lines Recognize those traits learn
[SPEAKER_01]: how to select those traits if that's the
trait you want Learn the base lines that
[SPEAKER_01]: and base lines being skunk one be familiar
with multiple kinds of Afghani's Haze of
[SPEAKER_01]: course original haze northern lights which
And also, you know Afghani's northern
[SPEAKER_01]: lights are pretty Pretty similar for for
all intents of purposes most Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: lights that you see are 2x5 That that's
the most common northern lights that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna see or 5x to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember how it was written And
what else that's skunk Haze bloom lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, but but but but uh, Afghani I know I'm
forgetting a major one here What's the
[SPEAKER_01]: major one I'm forgetting anyway Learn the
baselines.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to help you so, so much in
the future for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was lucky that my mentor taught me
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think many people teach that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern Lights number six is quite
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from Trichome Technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Mr. Cuban?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, blueberry isn't necessarily a
baseline, but it's a good one to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I highly recommend not running
the new blueberry, which is very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very indecadominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend the old blueberry sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush is, would be involved with the
Afghanis and Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of covers that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just learn those baselines,
even Bubba Kush, because Bubba Kush isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: so much different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't realize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you learn those lines, even Super
Skunk would be one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you will, Hemdog is not a baseline,
no, not even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you learn those, you'll be able to
identify everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: On that note, what's the makeup of
RiotBerry?
[SPEAKER_01]: RiotBerry was just like every other
fucking legendary line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it was a jar seed, if you want
to get technical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that came out of jar, a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was PNC.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was I working?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it called?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was BCC, Beneficial Pair Collective,
San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing, I was growing in the back for
them, the bud that they were selling,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they would also buy a bud,
bring it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude who, he's a well-known older
breeder in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: He brought in some Cherry Cone Kush,
which is his strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really good, really dank,
but it didn't smell like cherries at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was never sure why he called it that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he brought in what was labeled as
Strawberry Koff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked the owner, I said, what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I saw it had seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, oh, that's actually blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smelled it and it smelled like peanut
butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was even more confused, but that peanut
butter shit was fucking dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked the seeds out of it, brought them
home, popped them trying to just get
[SPEAKER_01]: phenose of that peanut butter,
run it, see what it was like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out came these beautiful, gorgeous,
purple blueberry syrup plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was how she was born.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably blueberry P91, I'm guessing,
because of the peanut oil traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the genesis of Riot Perry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my many babies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fuck you, Cuban.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a bastard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about horses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics of Blueberry Muffin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry Muffin is just a phenotype or a
cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the Riot Berry phenotype from Riot
Berry OG, which was the original OG
[SPEAKER_01]: crossed to Pakistani Chitrali,
the Green Lemon Feno.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone done a side by side with the Dark
Heart release of what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is their fake blueberry muffins?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would we do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: We already know where their fucking
bullshit came from and who did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has no relation to mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking retarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a retard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this has no relation to mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just took a well-established name,
slapped it on their fucking new bullshit,
[SPEAKER_01]: and are trying to push it as legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there is no comparison because
it's so drastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know people were calling Sunshine
Daydream the Blueberry Muffin Cut,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't think that there's any way
that... It's one of those times when I
[SPEAKER_01]: just have to realize that I didn't pick an
original name by calling it Blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: Muffin because it's something that people
want to slap on everything, so I just
[SPEAKER_01]: don't give a fuck anymore about the term
or any of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure where the Humboldt Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: is from, and not to be confused with
Humboldt Seed Organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: are the ones naming lines like Jack Harrow
that have nothing to do with Jack Harrow
[SPEAKER_01]: or very little to do with Jack Harrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took my Blueberry Muffin Cut,
slapped it on one of their lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done that with a bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just all around pieces of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: HSC not HSO.
[SPEAKER_01]: HSO are fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've never done anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: are assholes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got blue baby shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not have Blueberry Butthole,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do need to come out of my shell,
don't I?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I think about 10K Jack?
[SPEAKER_01]: Depends on which one you're asking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the original 10K Jack from Oregon,
which was a Lemon Jack Harrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very much a traditional Lemon Jack
Harrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's one of the common
phenotypes you find in Jack Harrows,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Lemon Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't massively yielding, but it was a
solid bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very northern-like dominance in the
bud structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably closer to skunk in the actual
structure of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very little haze in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, it's fucking, it's stellar weed,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the best lemons I've ever
grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also 10K Jack, which was named by
Green Dot Dave, and it was a Jack Harrow
[SPEAKER_01]: cut that came from Bodhi that was just
called Jack Harrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He called that 10K, and that is closer to,
say, like a Jack the Ripper
[SPEAKER_01]: Chernobyl-looking strain, and it's very
lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, Cuban.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as they keep your Cuban ass out,
then I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Panic Piff, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who has that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my buddy Kaia has some Panic Piff
drawn out and shown on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: The original Kaia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Death by Lemons, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 10K from Bodhi, yeah, it's very
similar to Jack the Ripper in looks,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's purple, kind of like Chernobyl,
and it looks like the Golden Ticket cut in
[SPEAKER_01]: the looks, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very limey.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't know much about Bodhi's lines
anymore, just because we just were good
[SPEAKER_01]: friends, but we both kind of keep our
heads down and do our own things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't memorize all his lines,
and he has a lot that he puts out,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it would just be too hard to keep
track, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm sure it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never seen an orange gelato strain,
so I don't think all the gelato strains
[SPEAKER_01]: are orange, because I've never seen an
orange gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be one or two, but I don't
know about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, things tipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is World of Seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're a terrible company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Real Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: is very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: World of Seeds, not so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: One second here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you puffing at me, Murray?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so someone asked the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to make sure that I have it
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone wanted to ask the difference
between Strawberry Roadkill and Roadkill
[SPEAKER_01]: Switchblade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberry Roadkill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so Strawberry Switchblade,
the main difference between the two is
[SPEAKER_01]: that Strawberry Switchblade incorporates
the Double Black Doja as well in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has a lot of reddish purple traits,
or magenta even.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Strawberry Switchblade is extreme,
extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the Strawberry Cream Afghani,
it's still very strawberry, but it's more
[SPEAKER_01]: focused on yield and resin production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the Roadkill Switchblade is a
little bit less yield, but way more
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to explain, because they're both
very strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Switchblade will always have the
Double Black Doja incorporated into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Motorbreadth15, you're asking me for
something way later.
[SPEAKER_01]: More recently made, and I don't know about
it, haven't used it, don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I don't know much about Bodhi's
Lines, guys, that have come out within the
[SPEAKER_01]: past few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could answer it, but there's so
many that come out, it's impossible to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep track of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my own company that I run and make
seeds with that I have a hard enough time
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping track of myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Real Lemon Tree, Real Lemon Tree is Lemon
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Organ Lemon Diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the same cut, renamed.
[SPEAKER_01]: SFEOG and ChemD, been done a long time ago
by Cat and Crip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who gives a fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone already did it, probably did it
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who made it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that Jimmy Nitz?
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't be mean like that,
because the guy's been around a while and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been done before and I don't know why
people just picked up on it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that whole hype thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: If people were knowledgeable, they'd be
like, oh, that's already been done and I
[SPEAKER_01]: could have already had it 90 times over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cat and Crip released those, ChemD,
SFEOG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could remember the name offhand,
but I think it was just ChemD,
[SPEAKER_01]: SFEOG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that it's probably been done a
thousand times between Cat and Crip and
[SPEAKER_01]: Jimmy Nitz.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a common combination, the Chems and
SFEs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think that it would be very
similar to Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never heard of Pittsburgh Cat Piss,
but the San Diego Cat Piss I'm familiar
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's just one of those
terms, kind of like skunk or whatever that
[SPEAKER_01]: people use.
[SPEAKER_01]: If an old plant back in the day smelled
like cat piss, they would call it cat
[SPEAKER_01]: piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of regional cat piss is
I'm not familiar with the Pittsburgh one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Storing seeds for long-term preservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are going to store seeds and not
touch them for, and you know you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to touch them for say 10 to 15
years, or you're only, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: store them and you're going to take them
out the second that you want to pop them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Freezers is okay for that, but you don't
want to come in and out doing that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you don't want to take it in and
out of the freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not good for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long-term storage fridge work great or
anywhere that is a cool, dark,
[SPEAKER_01]: dry environment will work, realistically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's my water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Murray, did you steal my fucking water?
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, where?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you sleeping on my water,
motherfucker?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I guess I don't have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, Murray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lay down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lay down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't use this excuse to get up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lay down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Murray.
[SPEAKER_01]: You little shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows I can't jump up and get him,
so now he's being a dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cut called Cush4 that Bodhi uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry for another, oh, I don't mind Bodhi
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't know a lot about his strains,
but the Cush4 is an old Neville strain if
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember correctly, and I do believe he
got it from Jim Ortega.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I don't, there's not a
lot of info about Cush4 out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that was an old Jim Ortega line
if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim Ortega I met on Mr. Nice when he was
using the name Dogless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I don't, it's not one that I'm,
I really, it's not one that pops up often.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very rare, rare, rare cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's said to be, it's said to be
the basis of a lot of Cush lines,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I'm not sure how true that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also some lines that I'm going to
get to look at from the scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone I know has finally gotten those
packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very rare old shit, and I'm curious to see
what's going to be in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think a lot of people know that
term, but I'll just leave it at that for
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, and I'll bring it up later when
I have more info.
[SPEAKER_01]: First ever cross, is there any specific
minerals or newts I should push more to
[SPEAKER_01]: help with seed production?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're feeding your plant for seeds,
feed it like a tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feed it lots of nitrogen and veg,
that helps them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about 4D?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does the name OG originate from?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it means original.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really what it means.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the old Cush, OG Cush.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's typical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not overgrown, it's not ocean grown,
any of that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just the original OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the white in white Tahoe cookies?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just white Tahoe,
the white.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is OG 18?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a DNA strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was from bear selection,
Karma said.
[SPEAKER_01]: They knew more about that than I do,
but again, I don't pay attention to
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking lame ass, faggot ass companies,
and I mean faggot ass in the nicest way
[SPEAKER_01]: that has nothing to do with homosexuality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one of those assholes that have used
that word to refer to dipshits.
[SPEAKER_01]: DNAs, they're pieces of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've always been pieces of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bait and switch their lines,
and all that info is out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and if people are still buying that shit,
it's on them to fucking suck it up and
[SPEAKER_01]: realize they just bought a load of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That isn't what they say it's gonna be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overgrow Cush.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, I had Crybaby watch the
video of Steve Tufts, talking about how he
[SPEAKER_01]: helped create OG Cush.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about the white?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of breeders using it,
but I hate it personally as a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: The white is an excellent breeder,
however, it does take a few bat crossings
[SPEAKER_01]: to whatever you cross the white to in
order to get rid of that mushroomy,
[SPEAKER_01]: earthy taste, and that's not ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's ideal from the white is it's resin
production, it's solid structure,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a great plant as far as that goes,
but I don't like the taste, smell,
[SPEAKER_01]: or high from the white, but breeding-wise,
it's an excellent breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: This goes with all things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are plants that are excellent
growers and terrible breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorilla Glue 4 is one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not predictable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna see a lot of boofy phenos pop
out when you cross Gorilla Glue 4 to
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, with certain lines, they breed
better than grow, and the white would be
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Moony?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, we'll do it Friday,
and we have someone recording these now,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we're gonna have it up on YouTube,
finally.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't realize that when they're
buying S1s, they're not buying direct
[SPEAKER_01]: copies of the clip.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not how it works unless the cloned
mother was picked from a line that was
[SPEAKER_01]: made very, very, very, very stable and
uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a deep chunk S1 would resemble its
mother very well, whereas a Gorilla Glue 4
[SPEAKER_01]: S1, you're lucky if you ever see that same
phenotype again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack Harrow, I like some Jack Harrows,
but Jack Harrow has thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes, and I definitely don't like
all of them, so it's kind of a broad
[SPEAKER_01]: statement to cover by saying, yes,
I like Jack Harrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think that.
[SPEAKER_01]: P91 S1s, they all kind of revolve around
that mom, but it's weird, different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see less peanut oil, sometimes more
skunky, more skunky, less peanut oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they all tend to kind of scale around
that mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any thoughts on the cube or Starfighter?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about the cube as far as I've
never grown it, Starfighter, same thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: never grew it, but when those seeds were
originally sold, you could still buy the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking parents in seed, so I didn't
understand why people were paying a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of money for something that you could buy
the parents of the seed stock from,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was just an F1 hybrid, so you would
see the same exact results pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just be a wide-open shotgun
result, and that's what you would see with
[SPEAKER_01]: Starfighter anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Mike has found a good Starfighter,
and they used that, but a lot of those
[SPEAKER_01]: Starfighters were not very good,
so yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I noticed Dekonomik's been pushing
the S1 glues pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look cool, the ones that he's had.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long did the broadleaf phenos continue
in the F generation?
[SPEAKER_01]: A five is when we started seeing more of
the Sativa dominance kick in to be true
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, chick?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not hungry right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing the thing for tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing the live feed right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have space for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't been good, Marie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's just doing his own thing,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just isn't listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why didn't you tell me you were doing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Dios Mios.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've been sitting in line for like...
Del Taco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, once Moony's in LA, once he's living
down there, we're going to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: full-time podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's finally starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people have been asking for it for
a long time, but you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long do I take skunk spray chem?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the phenotype, just like
everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different phenos go different lengths,
and I take it as long as it needs to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do the whole week counting thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just run plants until they're finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never understood that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess it's good to try to have
things planned out, but as you learn how
[SPEAKER_01]: seed lines go, you should know that there
are several different phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and just giving you a number would be,
again, a shotgun effect of just trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: guess at what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes real Philly, real Philly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Joey?
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see Gold Coast pee-pee his pants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you make him pee-pee his pants?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard not to think of ethos when
people think of S1 Glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fook that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cook him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fook him.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys a bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: B-I-itch.
[SPEAKER_01]: What other questions you guys got that
aren't...
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically about Bodhi seed lines that I
have no idea about anymore?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, and it's not any disrespect
to Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bodhi's my boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love him to the end of the moon and
back, but it's hard to keep track of my
[SPEAKER_01]: own lines, let alone his.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, apprenticing with a good
breeder is going to be a hard thing to do
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of the good breeders are
older guys and paranoid of people,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we've all been fucked over a lot by a
lot of people, especially people that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've helped or apprenticed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dying breed Z-Cube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can talk about Z-Cube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually can talk about Z-Cube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Z-Cube is... Okay, so the Z-Cubes I have
grown and seen are very tall plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: very lanky, very leggy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: End of the moon, end of stars,
but you're further.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you further, friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually further than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very leggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has hard, dense buds, but they stay
about golf ball size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very fucking resinous.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the Skittles trait with the sweet
Skittles smell, I haven't found it in any
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Z-Cubes I've ran, so I'm not sure
if that was their intention with the line,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm thinking with the Skittles lines,
it's something that they wanted and didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: get, but it is very uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even for an F1, they were all pretty
uniform, as was their Black Rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not doing any more Sour Grapes Grape
Stomper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that nine years ago, released it to
not much fanfare, and then later on,
[SPEAKER_01]: Gage Green released the BX1 and then
claimed he created it because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know... And people bought it,
ate it up, and still repeat that Gage
[SPEAKER_01]: Green made Grape Stomper to this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was made by our buddy JoJo Rezo.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Blackbeard?
[SPEAKER_01]: Brinjamin?
[SPEAKER_01]: But with all that said about Z-Cube,
I can say it's fucking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very good line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worth growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been very surprised with the Dying
Breed stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually, when a company pops up,
I don't buy the hype automatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are like, oh, what's up,
Zip?
[SPEAKER_01]: Zip, zap, zow, like with all the Z's and
just all about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hung back, and I said, you know
what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna wait until I grow some of this
shit before I... Kai does not have the
[SPEAKER_01]: Panic Piff picks.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does he have up?
[SPEAKER_01]: He has Panic something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might just be 710 Panic then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if he has the Panic Piff or
710 Panic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I had to grow it for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, man, I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Black Rose is probably the most
impressive thing that they have done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dragon Fruit I have popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't run yet, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a report on that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Z-Cube and Black Rose and
Watermelon Skittles is okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as good as anything you could get
from most common places.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the Black Rose is special.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that one is the special one.
[SPEAKER_01]: As is their gas pedal, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their gas pedal is fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Chem D Fireball OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the most beautiful lines
I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a few notes from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just fucking gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely fucking gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I'm not working them into lines
or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to see what was up with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Watermelon Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get watermelon from it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: At all from anything that I grew from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was slightly sweet, like Dutch sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there was some Dutch sweetness
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what Shiel D is, but I know
the Sham D.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was just a term we used to refer
to anything that was called Chem D that
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Shiloh D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, gas pedal's the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Black Rose gas pedal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Z-Cube's very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Black Rose and gas pedal were
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fee-fucking-nominal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who did the Fireball OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure whose that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing I will say with Black Rose
is that I didn't see a single Purple Fino
[SPEAKER_01]: in any of it, and they're all super
uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one of those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes in F1s, you'll see it a lot,
where it's two polyhybrids crossed,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you'll get a very uniform line.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in F2, it turns into craziness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Levin Versace.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen pictures of that, and it didn't
appeal to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not Black Rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Black Rosé.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black Rose is a different line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen stuff called California
Black Rosé, but this seed pack just said
[SPEAKER_01]: Black Rosé.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with them, I'm not sure if it's
California Black Rosé, and Black Rosé is
[SPEAKER_01]: just a shortened term, or if Black Rosé
was something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also Rosé.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosé is different than California Black
Rosé, and I'm not sure if California Black
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosé and Black Rosé are the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, see, mine just says Black Rosé on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was in one of the... It's like a
cardboard cylinder thing, and it just says
[SPEAKER_01]: Black Rosé on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know if it's California
Black Rosé or Black Rosé.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen Green Dot Dave's grow California
Black Rosé, and his was deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of these were remote.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't look anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even close to what Dave's looked like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm assuming it's a different line,
but I don't know for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Black Rosé is not a Black Rose cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosé, I'm 99% sure, and they're probably
gonna tell me I'm wrong, but I'm 99% sure
[SPEAKER_01]: about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dying pretty science, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Russian Kush, Oz Kush, and the old
Mendo line effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is the, I think, mother to purple
effects by Not So Dog, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Effects, Oz Kush, and Russian Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out insane, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out fucking insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about white rhino?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, Google it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus Christ, Cody, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's enough info about white
rhino out there that I don't need to even
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about white fucking rhino.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty well covered strength
buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, what other stuff we got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Clockwork Orange, I talked about that just
a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna bust everyone's balls,
Brian, just because I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not DOS effects, no, just effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us more about medicine, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technicality on the white rhino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Las Vegas lemon, is that the lemon skunk?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the old Chitral skunk,
I would assume, like most lemon skunks
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like those oblivious strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're so sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're so sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I think of haze?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which haze?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, oh, haze man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the Google info up to Matt's standards?
[SPEAKER_01]: On white rhino it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did, Mr. Matt Elite Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't listen to Faggot Bruce long
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, I'm gonna say,
everyone should listen to fucking Faggot
[SPEAKER_01]: Bruce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody, go YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Faggot Bruce, best rapper on earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already did the riotberry story.
[SPEAKER_01]: You missed it before you came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You missed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: San Diego Green Crack, now that I know
it's different from Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the San Diego Green Crack,
we've always kind of thought it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it always kind of made me wonder why
the Kush was called a Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: But San Diego Green Crack is either
Nirvana Papaya crossed to something else,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it lines up closer with So Mango.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably So Mango Super Skunk or
Papaya Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know much about NorCal Cat Piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only know San Diego Cat Piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's hard to say, Dinkman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what that could possibly be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Need a lot more info than that to look at
it and kind of get an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with so many new companies,
just Paul and Chuck in 90 lines together,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really getting harder to do that
identification just from either a
[SPEAKER_01]: description or from just looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier to break it down to base
lines, but I couldn't tell you exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you base lines usually,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grape Banana Dink.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even remember what's in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't sell much of that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure it was like the shock
something or I can't remember off the top
[SPEAKER_01]: of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can try to, you can DM me a
picture of it, but there's no guarantee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shoo, motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: The liniest of the lime is going to be the
Limelight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that carries the heaviest lime
traits of any of my lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not currently selling Sprite or Lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's called Slider because I
misspelled it instead of Spider.
[SPEAKER_01]: I misspelled it when I was printing out
the tabs and I just got lazy and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, all right, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt Rise is also a rat, so who gives a
fuck about Matt Rise?
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I don't offer those for sale
just because I've been passing them out
[SPEAKER_01]: for free to everyone, but Limelight for
sure is the most lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: A Vredo stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Grape Pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that is the fucking most
killer thing that has come out that I have
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced from his stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Jill?
[SPEAKER_01]: And not many real people, man,
but yeah, Matt Rise is a fucking rat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a limestand at the fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is Rat Rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I've had a few people
confuse me for Matt Rise, which really
[SPEAKER_01]: sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if there's anyone I would not want to
be confused with, it's that rat piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or Rez, thank God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank God they don't confuse me for
fucking Rez.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've run a lot of Top Dog packs,
yes, I have, over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing new, but yeah, past stuff for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the one that I run.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only one real cut of Grape Pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harry Palms got one seed of it and that
one seed that he popped was the,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was a Grape Pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really, really lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, once you start seeing Amber
Tricomes Denali, that means that
[SPEAKER_01]: degradation from THC to CBN has started to
occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want it when it's most cloudy,
least amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you want to go for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's where you like the smoke to
be, some people like CBN heavy smoke,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is indeed the one I used to make
Black Banana Pie, not Black Pie,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I hear my Black Pie is equally as
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't really have a Black Pie,
that was a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a bunch of crosses I wanted
to do with my Chocolate Tie mail,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I didn't because it won't sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I'm working on a few places for
that to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give it to Cuban to work some
lines and it's going to go to another
[SPEAKER_01]: location where I can work some lines with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it just gives you a different
high, but I don't think that there's any
[SPEAKER_01]: high associated with Sativa or Indica that
is accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very, it's bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't associate a specific high with
Indica or a specific high with Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way that doesn't play out that
way, unfortunately, but that's how most
[SPEAKER_01]: people do refer to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have any knowledge and have
grown out a lot of different lines that
[SPEAKER_01]: you would call Sativa and a lot of
different lines you would call Indica and
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of different lines you'd call
hybrid, you'd find Sativas that have what
[SPEAKER_01]: you would call an Indica high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd find Indicas that have what you'd
call hybrid high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really hard to say on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a little miracle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is an old wives' tale,
that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to stick around till time in
Memorial though because collectives,
[SPEAKER_01]: one, people who own and run collectives
for the most part are uneducated and they
[SPEAKER_01]: will always call shit Indica, Sativa or
hybrid and they'll be the first ones to
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking act like these car salesmen and
tell you exactly how that line's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: affect you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is fucking retarded and dumbest
shit I've ever heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody has a different body chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's receptors interact differently
with different strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, it's stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's reckless to in many senses it's
reckless because a lot of people have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, medical conditions that they
require cannabis to alleviate the pains of
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever, you know, the symptoms of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these people are recklessly telling
them that this will do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is, that's reckless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's see what else we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever that weird mutation, malformation
on the monkey haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone said it was a trait seen in the
OPT.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what you're referring to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the crinkle leaf?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, I mean, the crinkle leaf,
you can find a deep chunk anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you're referring to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you can tell more on the leaf
structure, whether it's an Indica or
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the, the term Indica and Sativa is
kind of out the window.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monkey haze, if I remember was the black
deep chunk pheno crossed to Tom Hill's
[SPEAKER_01]: haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Tom Hill, he made this way later,
like right before he stopped making seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: or not stop making seeds, but before,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know if he makes seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was, it was way later when he
made that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember you had already, deep chunk had
already stopped being on the market by the
[SPEAKER_01]: time monkey haze came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know how many times I could
say different, different, but the terms
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica and Sativa really don't have a
place in this market or in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore, specifically referring to effects
or structure or type.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I can absolutely show you a fucking,
even a type with a broad leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: slightly broad leaf tie that with narcotic
effects that would be more narcotic than
[SPEAKER_01]: what most people would associate with like
a bubble push.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that alone shuts down that whole Indica
Sativa hybrid type thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it just doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is not, there is not, nor has there
ever been just three types of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a really, for the time and the
knowledge with cannabis, it worked for a
[SPEAKER_01]: while, but it definitely has no place now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Committed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're missing the whole point on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is, it's not Indica Sativa,
nor should it have ever been referred to
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the fact is that our education
wasn't complete at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it was called the way it
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know when you get that done,
Yellowhammer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not just about poly hybrids
taking over Indica Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm referring to as land races even
that have similar effects to what people
[SPEAKER_01]: would call an Indica, whereas it is a
Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't quantify it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, it's always been that way,
but people's education hadn't caught up to
[SPEAKER_01]: what cannabis actually was and how it
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, is there a guidebook or the indicates
cannabinoid and terpene profiles and how
[SPEAKER_01]: it affects that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, everybody has different body
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody has a different body chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no book that can tell you which
way a certain terpene is going to affect
[SPEAKER_01]: your body chemistry because it's so vastly
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else we got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica, the term was originally developed
for India.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indicas were developed for Indian
subcontinent cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of more about right seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like being, it's like Indica Sativa hybrid
right seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's like, like type one,
type two, type three, and now there's type
[SPEAKER_01]: four, which is just right seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, pretty much just, you know,
if yeah, right seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personal body chemistry plays the biggest
role of anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you, when you go into a
collective, um, and they tell you how some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these are going to affect you,
you should slap them in their fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them not to be so goddamn reckless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I saw another question somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativa is simply Latin for cultivated.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Elaborate on males that throw a single set
of pistols on a whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what, what that would mean if you have
a set of male throwing a set of pistols on
[SPEAKER_01]: one single spot of the plant, it means for
some reason, um, ethylene was directed to,
[SPEAKER_01]: am I right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethylene?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethylene was directed and not blocked for
whatever reason that hormone was released
[SPEAKER_01]: in that particular region of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what causes it to throw
pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, most males release enough,
um, uh, uh, Debrellen on their own and
[SPEAKER_01]: they block ethylene so they can be a true
male.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it usually works.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, sometimes it's not always the
case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some reason, and it's not always
the same reason, um, ethylene is let in
[SPEAKER_01]: and Debrellen is blocked on a single
branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be something from light leaks
or for some reason, nutrients are getting
[SPEAKER_01]: trapped in that one area and excessive
nitrogen is causing that to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a thousand reasons that can cause
that to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it doesn't necessarily mean that the
plant is always a herm, but it does mean
[SPEAKER_01]: that for some reason it is letting that
trade through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, now there's the argument and I don't
know scientifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly don't know how accurate it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know DJ Short talked about it in his
book saying that, um, he likes males that
[SPEAKER_01]: herm because it leads to more female
offspring in the progeny because it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it has a, a leaning towards letting more,
uh, ethylene in to cause female
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it means it like, like the,
the progeny is predetermined to be
[SPEAKER_01]: ethylene heavy, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I don't know if it's true or not
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I did it once with, um, I w it was a,
I had a blue sativa line, blue velvet,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and I crossed it to a C 99 male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the, I was trying out the DJ Short
technique and seeing if that worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, um, the blue velvet would herm from
time to time and the C 99 was a
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphroditic male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from the progeny, we didn't see any
herms, but there wasn't much, it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: slight, but only, only slight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't have enough of a population
to run to really get an idea of,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, if it was truly female dominant.
So,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I don't smoke a lot of CBDs,
so I don't know about the lucid drip.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you eat a bunch of fentanyl though,
you'll have some fucking lucid fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: dreams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the Afganica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the Afganica quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm growing outside and I'm getting
hollow main stems and I got no other
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any idea?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that bad?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, hollow stems mean there's no
difference between hollow or not hollow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as far as it being bad or good,
there is a difference, but it's not bad
[SPEAKER_01]: nor good.
[SPEAKER_01]: One isn't necessarily bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily more hempy than the
drug type.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just old.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's an old terminology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's old thought processes back when they
were still trying to, um, keep hemp as a
[SPEAKER_01]: separate cultivar from the drug type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, they would say, oh, this one's
more of a drug type, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: selecting out of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's more of a drug type because
it's got the hollow stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is from a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't, it's, it's not even remotely
relevant anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not remotely relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How wide of generations of variation on S1
seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's no way to, to say that because
it depends on one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see if I can break this down
because I've, I've tried to explain this a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot and a lot of people don't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let's say you are going to choose the
clone yourself that you're going to S1
[SPEAKER_01]: from the seed line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say you have some, let's go with
Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say Skittles was a line,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an, it was an F1 line and you're,
you're like, okay, I want to pick this
[SPEAKER_01]: Fino from Skittles because it is fucking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to S1 it and start to lock down
the traits from this specific Fino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you go to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You reverse it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants will come out pretty plentiful
and, and, and different wild, wild
[SPEAKER_01]: variants because Skittles has a lot in it
and it's a poly hybrid and the line wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like it's an F6.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to see wide variance
swing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not quite as wide as out crossing it,
obviously because you're not bringing in
[SPEAKER_01]: more genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're keeping it at the base level
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you're still going to see that
wide swing.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, let's say you go to S1 deep chunk
because deep chunk is a heavily worked
[SPEAKER_01]: line to where it's down to roughly four,
three to four phenotypes, um, that majorly
[SPEAKER_01]: show themselves probably five or six,
but four, three to four that may,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that show up the most often.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see much less variance in
that because you chose it from a worked
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully that helps you describe
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or understand that, um, clearer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You subscribe to the idea that picking
late showing males is always better
[SPEAKER_01]: because early showing males.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I don't just, I don't subscribe
to that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I choose my males based on, um,
a few things, but some of them are
[SPEAKER_01]: superstitious and I'm going to be real
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the males that I pick,
it's all on superstition and I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: until I run the progeny if that was
correct, but you got to start somewhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I like to keep that proprietary of
what my actual choosing is, but it
[SPEAKER_01]: needless to say it's superstitious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, yeah, uh, you have to,
you have to, when it comes to choosing
[SPEAKER_01]: males, you never know until you run the
progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the times the males that end
up being the most effective in the
[SPEAKER_01]: outcross, uh, of the plants that I run,
weren't my initial choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's got, that's gotten to be less
and less and I've gotten better at it over
[SPEAKER_01]: the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, um, still that, that tends to
show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, to find an outlier of deep chunk,
which you'd need to do is do, do like five
[SPEAKER_01]: or six, uh, F gens of open pollinations
and you'll find those outliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll start popping out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you, uh, work the line back out
is through open pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crybaby.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people, like when I hear
people say, Oh, I always choose my males
[SPEAKER_01]: when they have the, the, the, the late
flowering males that have like hollow
[SPEAKER_01]: stems, like all that shit is just,
is good as fucking flinging shit at,
[SPEAKER_01]: at a plant and whatever has the largest
amount of shit on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pick like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a wing and a prayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, but the only thing that matters
is running the lines, finding out if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate and the way you want it and be
being willing to drop the lines that
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in town driving around, need that
green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, poor thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poor sick meds, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Poor fucking sick meds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm driving around your town.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need that green crack that, you know,
the one where I wiped your name off it and
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking attitude your line.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could said it was my S one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You missed the joke, Brian.
[SPEAKER_01]: You missed the joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're late on the joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking sick meds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any original white cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still have the white.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always kept the white.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it for breeding in certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can a reversed male's pollen be sterile?
[SPEAKER_01]: Reversed male's pollen is almost always
sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the pistols are mostly sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should say not their pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: A reversed male shouldn't have pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: A reversed female can have sterile pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes a lot of is more sterile than
others, but yeah, it's, it's definitely a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot harder than people think to reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to get a plant to reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not easy necessarily to, to collect
said reverse pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes a lot of it's sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like I have one minute remaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope you guys have a rad weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to pop on and chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you remind me next time,
gas fat, I'll tell you about the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the platinum alien orange cookies and all
the other shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, next Friday, I believe is the,
the Mooney part three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are going to have this fucking
recorded this time because my buddy's
[SPEAKER_01]: helping me now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would I share?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would I share anything with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: People be fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's exed later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
