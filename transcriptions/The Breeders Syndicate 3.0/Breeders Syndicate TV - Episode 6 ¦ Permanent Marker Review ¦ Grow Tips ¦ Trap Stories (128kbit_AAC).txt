[SPEAKER_00]: TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to be reviewing
permanent marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking about silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking about some new
seeds from bittersweet and we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be talking about a few other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weedertips and some trap stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that's your thing, if you like these
episodes, if you've been having fun with
[SPEAKER_00]: Chuck Dog, let me know in the comment
section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw me up a like, throw me up a
subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also tune into the Friday shows with me
and Matt while we talk about history,
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and other things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really contribute a lot,
but I still have fun being on there with
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt and hanging out with you guys and
gals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we're going to jump into it
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually smoking on some of that
permanent marker right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a more modern, you know, genetic from
what I understand on the internet and
[SPEAKER_00]: talking with Farmer Dan before the show is
some kind of, you know, sure jealousy or a
[SPEAKER_00]: biscotti jealousy, sure BX of some kind,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really get a lot of biscotti from
this either does Dan from the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: he's experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmer Dan's growing out a few crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got some experience with the Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got some experience with the skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got some experience with the
permanent markers a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I asked him about it and stuff and he
really likes it, but that's a homegrown
[SPEAKER_00]: version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, currently today, I'm going to be
smoking a red version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked up a little eighth like a little
weirdo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the sea junkie one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's saying sea junkie.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the heck Chuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why you what do you I don't fuck with them
really but like at the end of the day you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys in the last video with the blue sushi
you were like that ain't even really blue
[SPEAKER_00]: sushi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about modern genetics and I'm
gonna get stuff wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't grow this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the day, that's y'all
want to do a little review.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say you like permanent markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is the closest thing I could
really find.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if I get it wrong with this,
it really ain't the right permanent
[SPEAKER_00]: markers or whatever that may be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dealing with rec weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got two more weeks until harvest and
then we're gonna talk about TK.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna talk about skunk dog,
skank dog, I should say from Sea Drip Rob.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna talk about sour diesel crosses
to the pure OG cushions from CSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about blue sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pops a little bit of hype stuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ain't gonna leave you hype guys out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ain't gonna just talk about old school
genetics 20 years ago or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna talk about a little bit of
everything and branch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gotta bring them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gotta spread the community out a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're too niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people get butt hurt and then,
you know, half the discord is mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanna go leave and start their own
**** which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, you grow men and women.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do whatever you want but we gotta
we gotta bridge out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna make this community bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna build an army.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna be stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too much bickering and drama in
the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's bring it together with Chuck Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if if if somebody else ain't
gonna do it, I'm gonna do it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but anyways got that little eighth of the
permanent markers been smoking on it for a
[SPEAKER_00]: day or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could show you bloods,
but you know, oh YouTube don't like us
[SPEAKER_00]: very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talked with Dan like I said a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been hashing it out and I'm pretty
sure this is permanent marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I pull it out, I smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that permanent marker vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's what we're talking about
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about some permanent
markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I wouldn't say it's as
powerful as this right here obviously but
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we we like to consider
ourselves, you know, glorified scent
[SPEAKER_00]: experts around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we got the permanent marker for
reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even get this bag open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't eat my Wheaties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should put my purse down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know but I got it open but I mean,
guys, it smells like sherb to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how do you really say it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking about this for three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: How I what you know what to tell you all
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, does it smoke good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it great?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it smell great?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it smells like sherb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sherb to me can kind of smell
anywhere from like kind of pixie candy
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors to that kind of almost I wouldn't
say citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ain't full on like that but it's kind
of got that like yeah, that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical citrusy sherbs smell that is
pretty common.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that in most of them and it's
really in tune with a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already on the market as modern
market or in in in the rec the rec weed
[SPEAKER_00]: stores or whatever basically at least here
in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a there's a lot of sherb stuff out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's like I don't really understand
the hype about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the imagery and the idea and the you
know, it's kind of cool for about 5
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds that your weed smells a little bit
like a permanent marker but it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: not for me and I'm not dunking on it
because you know, at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: this ain't a homegrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ain't this could very well not be the
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could very well be something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who really who really knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I getting biscotti from it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like biscotti kind of are it's alright
for a more of a modern strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really really kind of like it but I
don't really get that from this and and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that's that's kind of disappointing
but the sherb side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sure you know, you could get
something like this from pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: anything out there if you're wanting to
recreate it or or you know, if I was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke something like this, I would
probably cross do some kind of truck and
[SPEAKER_00]: chuck it to something with a little bit
more potency so you can go in and really
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, dial it in and pick you know,
don't let these guys and gals make
[SPEAKER_00]: selections for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go out there and pop some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys grow your own make your own
trucks find the tailored plant for you
[SPEAKER_00]: that works for you the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you want to you can I'm not
trying to hate on it because there are
[SPEAKER_00]: people that like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, shout out Dan and maybe that's
the secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta grow some at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously get that get that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comments below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do y'all like permanent marker?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you got some stuff you're growing at
home that are this permanent marker or a
[SPEAKER_00]: cross of some kind of to rip my dick off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pop some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not you know, we're going to pop some
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to pop seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to grow different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know I'm trying to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to put on a show for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't just stay in one little niche
lane and just keep popping sour plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: TKs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to grow other stuff, you know,
or whatever, you know, do we got to
[SPEAKER_00]: support other people not you know,
these these dickheads and shit out here?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but we can check some crosses and some
trucks out some different, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: different plants and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so let me know in the comments section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is Chuck Dog gotta do to get some
good permanent marker?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'll be honest, this ain't really
it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give this a four out of 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: The overall smoke isn't really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty smooth and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it I guess the hype behind it is just
more for me is more of a disappointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know, I've tried other other
plants that are similar to that that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been homegrown and I've grown myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out local you're sure best one cross
I think it was to the P 90 era the sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean do anything with P 91 in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kicks up that freaking potency that
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like I really enjoyed growing,
you know that because you could find that
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherbert Sherb kind of vibe in it or
whatever you're looking for and but still
[SPEAKER_00]: get some potency to there were some
raunchy ones in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like some raunchy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to smell some tuna, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to smell some dirty but whole I
want to smell some feet bro when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want some raunchy cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want some armpits bad breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want skunks rubbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you know, I don't really get into a
lot of these other more modern flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're cool to try here or there
especially but you know a lot of fruity
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff unless it's really on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want some raunchy make me feel like a
dirty dog down in there all my hands and
[SPEAKER_00]: knees between her legs is a little like
it's going to town on her, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what I want to feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to smell raunchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to feel like a dirty little skate
dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know visually it's cool looking
manicure real manicure trim bud the
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures online where some people had if
it was really the permanent market were
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a visual plan and worth good for
the market modern-day market because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: visually appealing in the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know a lot of the guys say they like
the permanent marker out in Cali and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe it's the cut is something
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know like I said,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the comment section, but I don't really
think it's for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather just sit here and smell the
sharpie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if I want to get the permanent
market takes me back to me and I used to
[SPEAKER_00]: huff all that takes me back bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes me back to the good old days
when things were simple and the the vagina
[SPEAKER_00]: flow like wine, you know, but anyways,
would I get get it again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not if you like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know give me some more information
that down in the comment section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below and maybe we'll talk about it on the
show next time, but you know, I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: roll me up some a little bit different
while we while we do this transition
[SPEAKER_00]: because I just you know, I don't really
find the eights when you're buying an
[SPEAKER_00]: eight a mile-hour bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really find much difference in
bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed buying bulk from like a deli style or
buy whatever a pre-packaged bulk deal at a
[SPEAKER_00]: cheaper rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't find much difference in potency or
overall quality milk for most of the time
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to a lot of the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So save yourself a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that eighth was like 20 bucks or
25 bucks with tax save yourself some money
[SPEAKER_00]: and they got freaking half ounces in there
for like 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're better weed than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting a half ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saving yourself money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, you're getting more points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saving some money even more
you're getting free stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, don't don't waste if you're
coming to Michigan if you're from down
[SPEAKER_00]: from the South you trying to get to a
place where you can buy some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you look you guys down there in the
South you can't or anybody you like the
[SPEAKER_00]: woods if you were an outdoorsman person
you like lakes you like fishing you like
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful women.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like good food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like pizzas you like subs or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call them up here gyros gyros hoagies
sliders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know but it's all good to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes in here and comes out the you
know, it's all good though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you like that kind of stuff,
you know, and you're coming up here to try
[SPEAKER_00]: some some rec weed you might be
disappointed especially you growing your
[SPEAKER_00]: own stuff at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said just don't fall for the
little eighth packaging deal get yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: some bulk flour and save yourself some
money and enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roll some big blunts big joints big bong
rips whatever you're doing just save
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself some money and some time and some
headache and go with something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I said some bulk flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of options out there
especially in some of these stores don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get lured into the the whole eighth by a
little mile or eighth game, but that being
[SPEAKER_00]: said I've been went off on another little
tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to pick me out something here to
smoke, but we're going to jump in to I got
[SPEAKER_00]: notes today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all I had to I had to write some notes
because I can't I can't keep on track with
[SPEAKER_00]: it everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to show off bitter
bittersweet y'all know bittersweet right
[SPEAKER_00]: the og king p91 s man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He done sent us some new seeds that I've
been excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been seeing them pop up on the
discord and I'm excited for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm really pumped, but he sent
me some of these seeds that I'm super
[SPEAKER_00]: super ready to super ready to pop bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna pop these I meant to pop them
last night, but I got into making love to
[SPEAKER_00]: my woman and how at the moon and I just I
got distracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but we got the Yoko Una Zuna Yoko Una.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't talk y'all which is the p91 s1
times Dolce Vita and if you don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what Dolce Vita is it's the Irene times a
strawberry cream, which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping to get some strawberry turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be really cool and I'm a guy
that loves cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: All flavors types wherever it comes out of
her enjoy a good creaming and there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got got it right there in the f2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna be a Dolce is it Dolce I
think Dolce Vita.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't talk y'all mom's got the hook time
findings, but my speech and stuff I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been I got kicked in the jaw on time by
zebra.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad used to have a zebra woman and
kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a long story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll go into that in her time,
but I got kicked in the jaw on the Z and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know my shit's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for me to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got hell scene, which is the
death star times Dolce Vita, which do if
[SPEAKER_00]: you like funky turps, I mean death star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got the Irene Kush BX,
which I also love Irene dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew out the Irene s1 from CSI last year
and they were a pain in ass, but once they
[SPEAKER_00]: got rocking they were awesome and finished
out to be some of the better plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: grew out last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For them shout out bitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the man.

[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say they use it and they don't
see results, but I want to talk about some
[SPEAKER_00]: silica today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something I have historically
used or ever have a lot of experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just relying on what I got going in in
my my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix and the and just basically can and and
being a few other little products from my
[SPEAKER_00]: my micronutrients and stuff like that,
but somebody left a comment on my last
[SPEAKER_00]: video talking about silica and you know,
just asking do I use it and and I had to
[SPEAKER_00]: say no, I actually don't I do know
somewhat a little bit about it that people
[SPEAKER_00]: have had mixed results with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't is it necessary?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not obviously because I've been
growing without it just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it help your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you got your P's and your Q's
on point if you're using the right if you
[SPEAKER_00]: you know if your garden is where it needs
to be and everything is properly balanced
[SPEAKER_00]: just like bitter was telling me,
you know, I I actually went ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: picked up some power Si and started
implementing into my garden and and I and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I'm losing my mind, but within 6 to
8 hours, I swear every plant in my grow
[SPEAKER_00]: veg in my veg in my veg tent all had more
rigidity to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'm losing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're saying there's no way that
that was those, you know, the little cell
[SPEAKER_00]: plant bodies were deposited into the cell
walls or whatever that fast chuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know you're losing it bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I asked better and he said it is
possible if you got it dialed in right you
[SPEAKER_00]: could see results that quick, but that
being said is a couple different forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, let's let's maybe dive into that
a little bit because there are some more,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know plant of you know plant ready
more available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I should say my bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some edibles a little bit ago my
old lady and I we made some little you
[SPEAKER_00]: know little coconut oils little coconut
butter and I put some in my coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta say and I'm a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to kick in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little lit right now, but that being
said I want to jump into the the different
[SPEAKER_00]: forms of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of talk about it and if I get
something wrong as usual, let me know down
[SPEAKER_00]: in the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please don't take my advice look to
some of the people that know more than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning along with y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is this has been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please leave stuff in the comments if
you got something you want me to check out
[SPEAKER_00]: you got something you want me to look into
or maybe something you think I might need
[SPEAKER_00]: to implement in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I'm not going to do
every little thing but I'll pick and
[SPEAKER_00]: choose what I think I you know,
that's cool or maybe a good idea and do
[SPEAKER_00]: some research just like we did with the
silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to talking to bitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to talking some of the other guys
some people were saying they didn't see a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I see a difference now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been almost what two weeks a week and
a half two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm I'm seeing a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that being said I wanted to jump into
you know a couple the the different forms
[SPEAKER_00]: of it real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here for you guys because I'm a big dummy,
you know, I'm I'm not that good with
[SPEAKER_00]: remembering stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not that good at communicating to be
honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from the south.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a overbite like say I got kicked by
the zebra in in my jaw, but we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first form of it, which is the more
common form of that a lot of us use or see
[SPEAKER_00]: or or maybe when you first learn about
silica you might think you when you get to
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the prices, let's just say
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might say well that one's for me Chuck
the potassium silica silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, you know $30 $40 a little bottle
a little gallon bottle, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one and done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's easy Chuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's different forms of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, we're going to go through
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to be your best form of
it, but it can any any form of it is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think and to a certain degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's me saying from my own
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know some people you know if
you're running it depends on what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: running in your organic guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running in a different set up,
you might not see the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have it some form of silica in
some other product you use so you might
[SPEAKER_00]: not need this product and most people
probably aren't going to use it and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk about the benefits of it as
after we get done talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: different forms of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a country guy takes me a second to get
through stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a long long drawn out
explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potassium silicate and what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a water soluble salt form of silica
widely used in hydroponic and soil
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It raises pH due to its alkaline nature
and must be added separately from other
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients to avoid precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what that means is you want
to add this first.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you got to do when you're mixing up
your nutrients is put your silica product
[SPEAKER_00]: in first because it's going to make your
pH spike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to add your base
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to add your Cal Mag and
then anything else after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty easy peasy simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to think much about it but
you do got to make sure you get it right
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep it tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you need to really be careful and
make sure you're putting your stuff in in
[SPEAKER_00]: the right orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the benefits it strengthens your cell
walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It improves your stem rigidity and it also
helps protect you know from pests and
[SPEAKER_00]: disease giving it a little bit extra
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know basically it's like almost like
armor in itself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know like kind of making it hard like
would you want to chew on a real hard
[SPEAKER_00]: silica filled material?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you want to go and get the next soft
little thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is they just don't want to eat
it and the pests and things will move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the mold you know just I guess a
little I think it's a stamen or stamen or
[SPEAKER_00]: forget what the little thing is a little
probe that comes down from a mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you looked at the stuff underneath the
microscope it's kind of cool actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it basically comes down and sticks at
that that uh well it's basically an
[SPEAKER_00]: anchoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It anchors to the plant and then that's
when you know how it attaches itself to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess the idea is it's just it can't
basically attach itself because it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: so strong, cock strong, rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know after they circumcise type thing
the rough skin left over that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: rough strong rigid you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah so we're going to jump over into
the sodium silicate and basically it's
[SPEAKER_00]: less common than the potassium silicate
due to sodium's potential for toxicity and
[SPEAKER_00]: high amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got what people really should
probably be using the most I think is from
[SPEAKER_00]: what I understand from understood from my
research is silicate acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say that right y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say that description.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant available form of silica
absorbed as a monosilicic monosilicic I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't talk y'all monosilicic silicic acid
there we go found in specialized
[SPEAKER_00]: supplements like power si and extreme
silica highly soluble and effective form
[SPEAKER_00]: or highly soluble and effective foliar
application but you can also obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: feed it you know feed it through just like
you normally would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess yeah so we've been using power
si and it's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be your your more what
you want to use it's also going to be it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be your better form of it but
it's also going to be your more expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: form of it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be surprised when you look at it
because it is more more concentrated and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll go further and it is a little bit
more expensive but I definitely think
[SPEAKER_00]: there there that's going to be your best
option and I think Mills makes some
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a couple other brands I'm not real
familiar with those brands so you do need
[SPEAKER_00]: to do yourself a little bit of research
and deep dive into that a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just getting tongue-tied all up today
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we could try it one last
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silicic we give up I don't care drop it in
the comments let me know then you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: also got diatomaceous earth which I don't
really I know some of you organic guys and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff use that I don't use that you know
you can use it for pest control and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that and I'm assuming it breaks down
as well into the soil a little bit but I
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't I couldn't imagine it would be
super available right away but what the
[SPEAKER_00]: heck do I know I don't really know so
maybe look into the diatomaceous earth
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said you know if you want
to try implementing into your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: silica might be for you you know it's
going to help your plant be stronger
[SPEAKER_00]: outside especially people like to really
use it outside because it's going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it supposedly more drought resistant
stronger in the winds it can deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: colder temperatures better pests and molds
and stuff I don't know it just sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: a beneficial thing all the way around for
me like I'm up in Michigan I get mold I
[SPEAKER_00]: get a few pests here and there especially
outdoors so like why wouldn't I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: add it it goes a long way you're not like
you're mainly just using it in veg some
[SPEAKER_00]: people use it all the way through but some
people there's people out there that say
[SPEAKER_00]: that it can make your buds too dense I
don't know you know some people say that's
[SPEAKER_00]: bull crap and don't have that problem so
you know take it with a grain of salt try
[SPEAKER_00]: it out see if it works for you like we
were saying there's a different forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: it you know I can't really say it the
proper way maybe you guys can you know
[SPEAKER_00]: your most common forms are going to be
your potassium silicate which is like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to know the difference
because you're going to see a bottle of
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's going to be 20 30 40 dollars
where is you know the salicylic acid is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be more expensive I'm sure you
guys are getting a good good show out of
[SPEAKER_00]: me trying to pronounce this stuff
monosalicylic acid there we go all those
[SPEAKER_00]: C's too many C's right there two two C's
two me eyes monosalicylic acid there we go
[SPEAKER_00]: don't help with the edibles of course but
we'll make it through that being said I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: having a blast learning about this stuff
you know a lot of times a few people
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about this stuff and it's hard to
jump into a conversation it's just the way
[SPEAKER_00]: my brain work I got that ADHD so it's just
the way it is it's hard for me to jump in
[SPEAKER_00]: and absorb some of stuff but but the show
is causing me to have to go down these
[SPEAKER_00]: rabbit holes and check out you know check
out some different stuff that being said
[SPEAKER_00]: that's pretty much it for a silica I mean
you want to implement it in your
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative growth growth more than
anything or outside you want to strengthen
[SPEAKER_00]: it strengthen up your plant you want to
get it a little bit more resistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: both molds and pests and things like that
drought tolerant you know cold tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: better I don't know guys if you if you got
the money to do it implement it try it out
[SPEAKER_00]: you can make it go a long way you know it
is what it is and always make sure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting in there first because it messes
with your it messes with your pH okay what
[SPEAKER_00]: else we got for you guys today I've done
lost my train of thought here going on a
[SPEAKER_00]: deep dive on the silica see oh another
thing I wanted to start doing these
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes is maybe something else like a
segment just I don't really know how I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna do it yet but as right now I'm kind
of thinking what did I learn this week is
[SPEAKER_00]: what it's gonna be called and basically
just hanging out with Matt on the show
[SPEAKER_00]: learning about breeding techniques and
seed making techniques whatever you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to call them chucking I'm a glorified
chucker that's what I call myself and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: proud of it but I asked him I said Matt I
was digging on the forums I saw Bodhi
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes would you know pollinate his
females and then he was thrown back into
[SPEAKER_00]: veg and he said yeah you can do that and
we talked about that we got in I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know you could do that and from what he
was saying it's something it'll definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: finish up so your seeds will finish up and
then the benefits of it is you'll have a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that's basically revege so you could
take cuts then or you can revege the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and throw it back into flower
harvest your seeds and throw that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing back into flower I thought that was
really cool you know and I and also we
[SPEAKER_00]: were we were talking about where I'm
losing her oh you can also over pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: just like you can under pollinate when
you're making seeds which I didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: that I always knew you could under
pollinate or just you know pollinate too
[SPEAKER_00]: early or pull your plant in your mail or
your reversal your verse plant too soon or
[SPEAKER_00]: however you're doing it or if you're
dusting on there's several ways you can
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate plants but he was basically
saying you know if you over pollinate you
[SPEAKER_00]: can really you can get a lot of immature
seeds as well which I kind of am seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: that a little bit now and some of my
plants I kind of pushed it I thought let
[SPEAKER_00]: that mother motherfucker probably
pollinate for like two weeks bro so we
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely over pollinated which I didn't
even know was a thing so something I
[SPEAKER_00]: learned this week I thought that was cool
I definitely under pollinated a lot or
[SPEAKER_00]: prematurely ejaculated a few times in my
life and that sucks but you know it is
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is as far as the grow content the
grow video that's coming I've been waiting
[SPEAKER_00]: on my freaking webcam and my little
microphones stuff are going on two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: from Amazon what's going on with Amazon y
'all they're supposed to be fast it's slow
[SPEAKER_00]: as hell I got the better stuff and
everything and they're taking forever I
[SPEAKER_00]: had loads show up drop off a lot of my
stuff for me here in this garage so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: get it cracking lacking get some grows
going like I said we'll have some videos
[SPEAKER_00]: rocking out for y'all doing that kind of
stuff showing some plants off I can't wait
[SPEAKER_00]: to pop some of these freaking strawberry
cream crosses some of these p91 s1 crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: dude I mean dude shout out bitter I'm
hyped for that I'm hyped for more sour
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff I'm hyped for more Kim I got some
Kim 91 that's content coming up here soon
[SPEAKER_00]: we did in the s1 and who knows maybe we
even could track down a cut or two I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know we're gonna try to do some stuff we
don't try to figure it out you guys don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get cuts pop seeds it's all you really
needs but for entertainment and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to try to do a little research
maybe we're looking to do some some
[SPEAKER_00]: different stuff like that maybe we get get
in a little bit deeper but for the
[SPEAKER_00]: meantime we're just having some fun and
like I said just trying to learn some
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff so I really appreciate y'all support
me I think we're gonna jump into a few
[SPEAKER_00]: weed or tips real quick I'm gonna finish
rolling this I promise you know while
[SPEAKER_00]: we're at it if you're looking for a good
grow book I don't know all of them Matt
[SPEAKER_00]: has a good video on him where he talks
about a lot of the good grow books from
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day and some of the better
ones today but for me I like to always
[SPEAKER_00]: have my marijuana botany from mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob Clark up on hand I don't use it a
whole lot but I have a look back on it in
[SPEAKER_00]: a few times and if I don't know if
especially if I can't find something in
[SPEAKER_00]: the discord a lot of times I'm leaning
into the discord to figure out what I need
[SPEAKER_00]: or asking guys like bitter H&L pot Matt
the breeders asking them what they do but
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and trying to learn from that
take a green take take a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: this a little bit of that and apply it to
what I'm learning and how I learned and
[SPEAKER_00]: just rock out with it you know anyways
we're gonna jump into the weed eater tips
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys liked that last episode I
figure you know why can't we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: weed eaters we all use them right at least
if you're growing weed you probably gotta
[SPEAKER_00]: like do some maintenance outside if you
own a property you want it to look better
[SPEAKER_00]: hey you want it to stand tall when
somebody stands about go you know drives
[SPEAKER_00]: by you want them to look good and all that
stuff so we're gonna do some weed eater
[SPEAKER_00]: advice maybe some mowing tips things like
that last episode we talked about how to
[SPEAKER_00]: string a speed head fed weed eater really
quickly so you can get to rocking you lose
[SPEAKER_00]: your string you run out of string that
thing I like to do especially back when I
[SPEAKER_00]: was mowing and weeding I carry a little
piece of the four or five foot piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: string and I'd fill me up one of them
little bottles with some two cycle you
[SPEAKER_00]: know some weed eater some some juice I
fill me up with some gas and I put that
[SPEAKER_00]: little bottle in my pocket the other guys
they wore fanny packs I ain't wearing no
[SPEAKER_00]: damn fanny pack but I put it in my pocket
and I carry a string with me so when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're out 20 20 clicks down a fence weed
in your and you run out of string because
[SPEAKER_00]: the jackass day before didn't fill up your
weed eater you're good to go so that being
[SPEAKER_00]: said I want to talk about weed eaters
again for a minute a lot of people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know this but when you're weeding there's
a proper way to walk the head on most
[SPEAKER_00]: common weed eaters is going
counterclockwise so the way you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: walk to where you get a smooth cut to
where that head the head is moving along
[SPEAKER_00]: that grass you're perfect especially when
you're up against a wall or rocks or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want to you want to get a
real clean cut so you don't got to sit
[SPEAKER_00]: there doing all this if you're doing all
this especially if it's been cut before if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing all this back and forth stuff
you're not doing it right you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: right way to weed is actually to walk
sideways to always walk left or to walk
[SPEAKER_00]: backwards going left if you're going right
say you're looking at your house or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're about to weed eat the way
you want to do it is go left always
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a couple reasons for that that's
the way they're designed the way the head
[SPEAKER_00]: spins if you go right it's gonna dig into
the ground it's gonna get it's gonna do
[SPEAKER_00]: all this it's gonna make your chop your
cut look real crappy you want it to look
[SPEAKER_00]: like a green glass lake grass lake of
water smooth as ice on a calm day you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what I mean and if you go right it's gonna
screw you up a lot of people see me
[SPEAKER_00]: weeding and short saying shit like dude
how do you stand weed eating in shorts bro
[SPEAKER_00]: like don't tell shit hit your legs I'm
gonna tell you a secret fam when you walk
[SPEAKER_00]: left all the debris thrown right so if
you're walking the right way not only are
[SPEAKER_00]: you not getting shit on your legs you're
also not throwing rocks into your window
[SPEAKER_00]: if you go if you go right and you face
that we you're forwarding and try to go
[SPEAKER_00]: fast as you can you're gonna throw what
you're gonna throw rocks you know you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna throw yourself you throw it to a
window I've done it before I've seen it
[SPEAKER_00]: done before you know it's easy to do so
always you want to walk left you walk with
[SPEAKER_00]: the sideways stance or backwards you're
saying backwards Chuck weeding backwards
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of weeding is hard enough well
it's called stamina brothers I hear you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys you know yeah and I see a lot of
people are kind of saying well you know my
[SPEAKER_00]: back hurts when I weed eat well you don't
that's why we talked about last time you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to have a steel a steel is not
gonna be the best for everybody I see
[SPEAKER_00]: little sissies out there with those straps
on and doing on like or there's different
[SPEAKER_00]: styles of weed eaters but that being said
that's why you go with a lighter you know
[SPEAKER_00]: like a shindawa you go with a lighter one
with a if you're shorter guy you can
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust the handles it's got a shorter rod
you know so you can kind of really take
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to tailor your weeder to you you
know you're not trying to buy the best
[SPEAKER_00]: weeder on the market because it's got the
name steel on it I'm sorry the steel is a
[SPEAKER_00]: great product but you got to really think
about what you're buying they're not made
[SPEAKER_00]: for everybody they're heavy they're bigger
they're not made for shorter people really
[SPEAKER_00]: so make sure you're getting a tailored
weeder for yourself so I rock out with
[SPEAKER_00]: shindawa's I walk it rock out with steels
I've had husk of Arnaz before I've had
[SPEAKER_00]: echoes or whatever a couple different
other brands but you know they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: about the same if you if you're doing
residential stuff but like I said I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to go with a lightweight shindawa for
residential stuff I like to go with a
[SPEAKER_00]: steel for for real heavy stuff some people
like to use a disc cutter or cutters and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff I like to use them too but when
you're working with you know guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: just get out of jail or addicts and stuff
like that no disrespect because I got them
[SPEAKER_00]: in my family but at the end of the day
they come in fucked up the next day they
[SPEAKER_00]: slice the legs off they slice my legs off
so you know weed eaters is a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: safer that being said I better not catch
you guys out with no damn battery powered
[SPEAKER_00]: or electric weed eaters if I see you got
one of those I don't know if I could be
[SPEAKER_00]: your friend really but yeah walk left walk
backwards I kid you not I would weed eat
[SPEAKER_00]: all day long for eight to twelve hours
walking backwards and my calves were huge
[SPEAKER_00]: I could run damn near backwards with that
weed eater I put them headphones in TNT
[SPEAKER_00]: just pumping destroying that grass fam and
you know when when you're doing that too
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you're doing this for a
business you're throwing the grass away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the house or your blower guy could
come in with the leaf blower and blow it
[SPEAKER_00]: out real easy and it also you keep
yourself clean you keep your truck clean
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it that way you can weed eat in
flip-flops damn near you can weed eat in
[SPEAKER_00]: shorts so it's just a little tip I'm
teaching y'all how to improve stuff we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna talk about edging we're gonna talk
about beveling we're gonna be talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about different stance stuff that comes
with weed eating and mowing and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining your yard I'm not a weed
expert but I'm a certified weed eater
[SPEAKER_00]: expert I have mowed commercially and
residential for many years I spent a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of time on on zero turns scags writes X
marks John Deere's whatever you know
[SPEAKER_00]: echoes whatever the purple puffed dragon
company I don't know I've been on a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff you guys so we're gonna talk about
that we're gonna improve your garden we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna talk about cleaning up leaves we're
gonna talk about cleaning up your yard and
[SPEAKER_00]: making it a little tall stand tall but I
think I wanted to jump over into a trap
[SPEAKER_00]: story real quick I was thinking about
doing two but we ran on a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: longer with the weed eater tip so we're
gonna talk about some trap stories and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I'm gonna take us back to the cabin
once again and this actually happened
[SPEAKER_00]: before my time running through the field
throwing all my plants out because I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought I was about to get raided if you
haven't heard that story go back and
[SPEAKER_00]: listen that one I think I was in it in the
last episode I'm not really sure but this
[SPEAKER_00]: one's at the same place but this was
probably six months to a year before that
[SPEAKER_00]: time and I have been growing I think it
was girl scout cookie s ones and what was
[SPEAKER_00]: it Cali Cali Oh and we saw bells from CSI
I had them inside they got real big I took
[SPEAKER_00]: them outside I had me a little garden
basically I live in a log cabin on a top
[SPEAKER_00]: of perched up on a hill with a long gravel
driveway down at the bottom there's a one
[SPEAKER_00]: lane road with a bridge that will cross
over a big creek I lived up in the woods I
[SPEAKER_00]: had a big giant tobacco and soy bean field
behind me that we farm and yeah just my
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbor I got a couple neighbors but
they're all down the road and so I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: growing weed out there I've done had you
know too much fun really growing I got too
[SPEAKER_00]: many plants going down I'm down there in
Kentucky bro you know this has been a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years back whatever but had too many
plants going but I'm having a good time
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out there messing with mushrooms I'm
out there messing with my plants having a
[SPEAKER_00]: good time with my Daisy Dukes raised up to
my freaking balls no shirt no shoes
[SPEAKER_00]: getting tan getting sexy having a good
time drinking liquor smoking and working
[SPEAKER_00]: on my plants there's nothing better than
being outside messing with weed plants I
[SPEAKER_00]: love it something about that Sun good
Kentucky Sun on you just getting a little
[SPEAKER_00]: tan working out there smoking thinking
about titties and just the way plants grow
[SPEAKER_00]: outside I love it just easy peasy Sun does
all the work and there's just not much to
[SPEAKER_00]: it dude you know you got your problems
with pests and PM though so then you got
[SPEAKER_00]: your pitfalls of growing outside let's not
make it let's not get it twisted there's
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that you know either way pros and
cons of both situations but I'm out there
[SPEAKER_00]: growing at four or five foot plants and
Sun's going down and I'm doing my water
[SPEAKER_00]: thing taking care of my mushrooms shit
like that and we got a pallet like a
[SPEAKER_00]: pallet wood a four by four pallet wood
fence all the way around our cabin that
[SPEAKER_00]: kept the dogs in we had a gate and keep
people out stuff whatever you know just a
[SPEAKER_00]: fence we saved some money and built a
whole fence out of literally T post wire
[SPEAKER_00]: and pallets so my gardens in the corner
facing the field out the back door and I
[SPEAKER_00]: have my little garden in the corner and
I'm growing probably at 10-15 plants out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and the Sun goes down and we're
hanging out everything's cool old lady
[SPEAKER_00]: makes them food we're watching some TV we
got dogs so anytime the dog barks I look
[SPEAKER_00]: out the window see what's going on not
because I'm necessarily paranoid I just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be prepared so I mean you know I'm
not up to no good really so I'm like what
[SPEAKER_00]: the hell is going on so I look outside I
don't see nothing in my driveway so I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like cool sometimes coyotes howl you know
or whatever so or the possum gets on a
[SPEAKER_00]: porch so the dogs bark so look at the
other window just on that other side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the room facing my one neighbor that could
see and they probably got a quarter mile
[SPEAKER_00]: or a half mile long driveway bro it's
paved and this is just after the dark so
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it's dark out and I see four
lights four cars and four lights rolling
[SPEAKER_00]: up that driveway bro I'm talking like
right on each other's ass like rolling up
[SPEAKER_00]: there and I'm we've been living there for
a long time so I knew you know I'd see
[SPEAKER_00]: people come and go and there's always just
one car my mind being the way it is I said
[SPEAKER_00]: dude that looks like the police and I
thought her and I said I said is that and
[SPEAKER_00]: they pull up I could see them pull up to
the house but the way they were driving
[SPEAKER_00]: the way they were on each other moving
like a little squad bro there's just the
[SPEAKER_00]: way they were the way the lights in
Kentucky at the time they were using the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ford Taurus is so you I think is what they
were the Ford Taurus so you could tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: way the light there were certain way the
lights were and on the back the way the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights were set up you could tell with the
rear end lights or whatever taillights so
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like that looks like the the police
and they go up to that house and they got
[SPEAKER_00]: their spotlights on they're knocking on
the door and my neighbor's single woman
[SPEAKER_00]: with some kids she comes out she's talking
to him and shit and this is probably I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know three four hundred yards away I
don't know maybe more but I can knock you
[SPEAKER_00]: make stuff out because I got porch lights
on and everything and the cop lights all
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit were on and they weren't there
but like five minutes and I was like I was
[SPEAKER_00]: telling her I was like what the fuck are
they doing and they're out like seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: them walking out in the field that they
got a big front yard like a massive one
[SPEAKER_00]: like probably four or five acres and
they're out there looking around and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're making their way towards the the
neighbor in between them and in us there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a big barn in a field there are another
neighbor owns but his house isn't located
[SPEAKER_00]: there and they're making their way towards
my my property and I thought her I said
[SPEAKER_00]: man like they're gonna come over here
they're looking for something you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: she's like no you'd be all right they're
just let me be fine well I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: something my gut told me like dude what
the hell you know they're gonna come up
[SPEAKER_00]: here so I always get myself in shit
situations like that and just being where
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from you don't want to get caught with
shit so it's like I'd rather sacrifice my
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and be able to sleep my own bed then
you know go to jail for some plants so I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: watching and sure enough bro they get back
in the car and they start cruising down
[SPEAKER_00]: that driveway and instead of going right
back towards town where they came from
[SPEAKER_00]: they all they start slowly turning left
and I told her I said they're coming up
[SPEAKER_00]: here just the way they were moving and
that's probably quarter mile maybe from
[SPEAKER_00]: like the way like when they leave that
drawback and see them drive to my driveway
[SPEAKER_00]: down by the bridge and they come up then I
got come up my shit and I thought all
[SPEAKER_00]: right let's say they're coming up here and
my plants at this time like four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: foot tall right and pallets only for four
foot tall four foot three inches something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that and sure enough bro they're
they're cruising real slow spotlights so I
[SPEAKER_00]: run outside dude and I grabbed them plants
start grabbing them bros me and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking in five gallons bro so I'm getting
two three at a time max bringing them
[SPEAKER_00]: inside and like I said I probably have 14
15 I'm out there and I get a couple in a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple runs in I look outside and sure
enough bro they're like stopping from my
[SPEAKER_00]: house and they start slowly driving up the
driveway my shit's steep so I thought you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be in the truck almost to get up
our shit so they're in these little cars
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's taking them a minute and the water
that washes down this driveway will wash
[SPEAKER_00]: out real big ruts so it's kind of rough
you know it's like Creek Rock driveway
[SPEAKER_00]: type thing and they're driving up at real
slow and I'm shitting and I'm talking I
[SPEAKER_00]: told her I said they're coming and I could
assume with the spotlights you know I'm in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cut bro so when they show up they use
spotlights spotlight and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: looking and I'm running these plants
inside dude and I probably get down to
[SPEAKER_00]: like the last four you know and I could
hear them bro won't come up at gravel you
[SPEAKER_00]: know sound of the cars and start seeing
lights close and I'm I'm in between my
[SPEAKER_00]: cabin and like the back facing the field
where you park and then they're coming up
[SPEAKER_00]: to drive on the front and where they can't
see me because the cabin essentially block
[SPEAKER_00]: blocking the view in the way it's like
kind of coming up a hill and I run two
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and I'm and I run I'm about to run
back outside and they're they're literally
[SPEAKER_00]: out in front of our cabin and the way you
had it like you had to kind of curve
[SPEAKER_00]: around this big curve in it there's a
bunch of trees and bushes you can't really
[SPEAKER_00]: see and then once you come to back you can
see like the cabin and the gate and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see you're on the whole yard basically
and bro I go go out that dog door and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: bare I'm I'm crawling like a little crab
bro like a Chippewa spider monkey going
[SPEAKER_00]: through the grass bro and I'm getting over
to that plant and I grabbed them plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just break them in half dude and I
pull them down and I got them plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just dragging them behind me and bro
as I'm doing this like you know how
[SPEAKER_00]: pallets are you can kind of see through
them or whatever and I can see his cop bro
[SPEAKER_00]: they all four kind of like pull up but the
one he stops right there in that curve
[SPEAKER_00]: where he can kind of see into the yard
there's an opening to like the the weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and the bushes and shit and shining a
spotlight in my yard bro like right over
[SPEAKER_00]: top of me bro and I'm I'm crawling I stop
I can see a spotlight and I had to turn
[SPEAKER_00]: all the porch lights and everything off so
it's pitch black other than his spotlight
[SPEAKER_00]: so he's looking and thank God like all the
plants and shit were like basically at
[SPEAKER_00]: that pallet level so like as I'm crawling
and he can't really see me you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're sitting there I can hear him
talking they roll their windows down I
[SPEAKER_00]: hear him talking shit and I get back to
the porch and I can't I didn't want to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to get up and they see me so I just lay
here for a minute and I was like man I
[SPEAKER_00]: gotta get in side because if they get out
and start looking around I got these two
[SPEAKER_00]: big pot plants here you know fuck so I
just like all my strength just break them
[SPEAKER_00]: bro break the fucking you know outside you
get three four inch stock bro like break
[SPEAKER_00]: it and I just slowly bro I meant using
like stuff on the porch let's cover I
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly crawl to that dog door like a
little worm bro and I get in there and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm sweating the shit and bricks you
know and I got all my plants congregated
[SPEAKER_00]: right there I tell her I'm like let's get
these in the bathroom you know and I look
[SPEAKER_00]: outside and they're starting to pull down
the driveway and they're leaving bro and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like I tell her I was like man we
just did it I just did it again I do this
[SPEAKER_00]: shit to myself I did in Kentucky bro you
get I've had so many close calls at that
[SPEAKER_00]: cabin alone probably four or five times
bro it's with police and like weird shit
[SPEAKER_00]: just people parked in my driveway go down
there and visit them we'll talk about that
[SPEAKER_00]: one next time and but yeah just weird shit
so I told her I said I done did it again
[SPEAKER_00]: and got all paranoid and shit cuz every
time I do it she's like just chill be
[SPEAKER_00]: alright I'm like I'm not going to jail
dude I got these plants out here these

[SPEAKER_00]: people's houses and stuff well he had come
up to my neighbor's house and try to force
