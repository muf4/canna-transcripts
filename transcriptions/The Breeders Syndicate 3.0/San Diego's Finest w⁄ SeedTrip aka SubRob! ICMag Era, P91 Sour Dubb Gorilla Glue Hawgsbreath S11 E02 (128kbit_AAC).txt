[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_06]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_06]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_06]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_06]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_06]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Matthew with my co-host Thousandfold,
and today we're here with a very good
[SPEAKER_06]: friend of mine, Subrob from Seed Trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seed Trip Seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we say Seed Trip Seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just Seed Trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just Seed Trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Thousand, take it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the first thing I wanted to ask
is actually, where does the name Subrob
[SPEAKER_02]: come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: That came from around 2000, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going on a road trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd settled in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going on a road trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea how the internet worked at
that time, and I was going on a road trip,
[SPEAKER_00]: so my girlfriend wanted me to set up an
email, and I tried Rob, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a few variations of my name, and then I
looked down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was eating a sub sandwich, and I'm like,
well, how about Subrob?
[SPEAKER_00]: From a sub sandwich?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's literally where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until a few years later, when I learned
how to Google, and I Googled Subrob,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a whole different Subrob came up under
images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some dude in leather who was submissive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet, sweet, submissive Rob.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first chance I got it, I changed it
to Seed Trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, I like Submissive Rob better,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good for him, but, you know,
it just wasn't my trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the loser daddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think about the submissive thing
at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking, like, Subrob, like,
less than Rob, which I thought was really
[SPEAKER_02]: funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I was working with that
idea, but now it was literally a sub
[SPEAKER_00]: sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Submarina, in specific, for those who see
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good shit, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was going to say, so you're saying
that was around 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you growing then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I started growing full time in the
early mid 90s in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had gone home for the first time to
Alaska to work and I went ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: grabbed Old Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been floating around Delta since the
early 80s, at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down to Portland and started growing full
time down there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you start, you mentioned Alaska.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's start there if we can.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in Alaska, during your years growing up
there, you know, you mentioned earlier
[SPEAKER_06]: that, like, it was more legal in Alaska
than it was the rest of the states.
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of stuff were you seeing when
you first started smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, nothing really had names back then,
at least not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some names just to differentiate
the growers, like Bruce's Halloween Bud,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Mike's Green Bud, you know,
shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry was the first one that ever had
just the specific moniker that I came
[SPEAKER_00]: across.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty self-evident why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's crazy cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still going, evidently.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you referring to Old Blue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Old Blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alaska Blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was watching one of the podcasts last
year and I was in the live chat and
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody, hopefully he's watching,
he or she is watching now, mentioned they
[SPEAKER_00]: were from North Pole, which is right up
the road by Alaska standards, Delta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked where I was from when I
mentioned I was from the interior and I
[SPEAKER_00]: said Delta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing he did was type in a
few blueberry emojis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I smoked that cut was
probably 82.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 40 years later, the same cut is still
synonymous with my hometown.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that predates DJ Shortbyte quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably, but I mean, I personally have
always thought just like skunk that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could find blueberry in very Afghani seed
lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just so cool to see something like
that back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so cool to know that there was
something like that back then that was
[SPEAKER_06]: prevalent and called Blueberry at the time
because of its sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was in high school when I first
scored Blueberry, it was probably freshman
[SPEAKER_00]: or sophomore year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would have been, that would have
been 84 or 85.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people I got it from talked about
it like it had been around for a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did he start his Blueberry line?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know he first started selling it in mid
nineties.
[SPEAKER_06]: So selling it, but God knows what,
you know, I don't know how long ago he
[SPEAKER_06]: worked it and let stuff out or clones out,
but who knows on that, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have no doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember seeing, when did the seed
catalog start showing up in high times?
[SPEAKER_06]: 85 was the first time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say that was, I want to say that
was the one where they were putting like
[SPEAKER_06]: Afghani one, Afghani two from Sam the
skunk band, that quick little list of
[SPEAKER_06]: skunk one and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where anybody would have
gotten any commercial seed in the interior
[SPEAKER_00]: of Alaska in the early eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lots of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of travelers in Alaska,
the same kind of hippie ex-pat veteran,
[SPEAKER_00]: angry, crazy motherfuckers who wanted to
go visit Afghanistan and India.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Alaska was also on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Itinerary, you know, a place, a good place
to go get lost, not be found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No shortage of seeds when I was growing
up, but clones really took hold in the mid
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around where I was from, especially
Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: When did you first see Matanuska Valley
Thunderfuck show up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, going back to strain names,
nothing really had a strain name back
[SPEAKER_00]: then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then, everything that came from the
valley, and I'm sure not just the valley
[SPEAKER_00]: being Matanuska Valley.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not Matanuska Valley, but probably
Anchorage and Palmer and Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably everything was called Matanuska
Thunderfuck, especially during the summer
[SPEAKER_00]: when tourists around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I bet, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, other people have commented
on some of my posts and threads that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've never smoked the same Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have commented that they've never smoked
the same Thunderfuck twice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder why it took hold though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, man, skunk, when did skunk number
one become a strength?
[SPEAKER_03]: 78.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that, that nips that argument in the
bud right there, because I was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: say skunk was a term before skunk number
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everywhere I lived, whether it was
Oregon, Alaska, California, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: all pre-internet, everybody used the term
skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 50 different strains named Maui.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the real deal MTF or the real deal
Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once people start using the name,
you know, fast forward 20 years later,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's to say what?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's lost in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: People didn't trade strains a lot back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were certain small groups that you
were basically, well, in my situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was, it was who your parents knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's where you got to cut if you got
to cut it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, I don't think MTF has been a
strain specific name since probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every grower in the Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to go down, I lived in
Anchorage for a couple of years and which
[SPEAKER_00]: is close to the Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the friends I knew who grew down in
that area were out in Matanuska Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was Matanuska.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sweat it because if somebody gets a
cut from Alaska, that's worth,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, making a hybrid out of or a poly
hybrid out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a pretty damn good cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had bad weed until I got to
Humboldt for college.
[SPEAKER_06]: You leave it to California to leave that
impression, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I also had some of the motherfucking
best pot I'd ever smoked in my life in
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt, but I'd never had bad weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did a lot of Mexican brickweed make it up
to Alaska too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't experience that till I moved to,
I might've seen some in Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when I moved to New Mexico was my
first real experience with Mexican
[SPEAKER_00]: brickweed.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not even that long ago,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got someone when we were, I used to
spend the summers in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents were from Humboldt and one of
the there, my paternal grandparents moved
[SPEAKER_00]: from McKinleyville to the Bay Area because
he worked for, so I used to score weed
[SPEAKER_00]: with my friend Matt in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I remember getting brickweed
then too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my teens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Were your parents growers or were they
into that scene at all, smoking at least?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my dad smoked whenever his friends
came over or he went over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe we're working or there's a lot of
partying in Alaska, you know, there's-
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I imagine so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also take work very serious
because a lot of the work you can only get
[SPEAKER_00]: done during the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the summers with all of our parents
were a matter of working 16 to 18 hours a
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you snatched a few joints from their
stash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got a thousand questions you want
to get in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually more curious about what
life was like for you back then and like
[SPEAKER_02]: how you, you know, how you gravitated
towards the plant and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was, I'll tell you what really
got me into weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first, the first stuff I got into,
I think my first true love in the drug
[SPEAKER_00]: category was probably LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved acid as far back as, you know,
I tripped the first, I started,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, fifth grade, sixth grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, by sixth grade, I'd had enough
trip where I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also grew up, grew up in an
environment where, where we didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have electricity for a lot of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I read a lot and my dad had a lot of
counterculture books.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really got into everything from the,
who were the whacked out hippies on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bus that began the whole hippie movement
to the Grateful Dead, to Mary Pranksters,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was a lot of mention of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, I viewed pot as
something to come down off of LSD or
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms or pain or all those,
all that speed we had in the eighties,
[SPEAKER_00]: black beauties, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever we used to get through the school
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what it was for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't really become something I was
really passionate about until I was in
[SPEAKER_00]: either sophomore year or junior year of
high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was assigned to write a story about the
war on drugs and, cause remember this mid
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't escape the war on drugs
propaganda.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got, I got assigned to write a
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it was journalism or if it
was just some sort of writing class on the
[SPEAKER_00]: war on drugs, specifically cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I used to do for my schoolwork is
in the library, we had these, they were
[SPEAKER_00]: like encyclopedias.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they were called the SIRS issues,
S-I-R-S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what they would address the
subject and they would present pro con,
[SPEAKER_00]: pro side and a con side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would back up each side with all
the evidence that they could find while
[SPEAKER_00]: they were assembling the encyclopedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went and I started reading,
you know, you start with the discovery of
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta THC nine, whatever it is in Israel
at a university.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I read all the, the pro sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I read the, the con side for
legalization of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I learned about the DEA
schedule, you know, schedule one through
[SPEAKER_00]: four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within 20 minutes, within a half an
hour, a 15 year old kid in the mid
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties, you know, no internet,
no outside interviews, just two books
[SPEAKER_00]: figured out that cannabis being illegal
was, was bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be a schedule one narcotic,
you must have no medicinal uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the guy who discovered and labeled
Delta nine THC also noted like the first
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment he did was on a cataracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, coma or something like that swelling
of the optic nerve and how cannabis had
[SPEAKER_00]: the medicinal effect of shrink back down,
not to mention all the bro science from
[SPEAKER_00]: all the hippies that, you know,
we're still in their thirties at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really shocking to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my first real moment of,
wow, the government is pulling one over on
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that led to, you know, the,
the industry behind the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in hindsight, it's tough to
remember when I discovered what phase of
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the industry of the war on cannabis
and who was making money off of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: where, and how much privatized you know,
prison industry and on and on and on,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as hard as it is now in hindsight to
remember the exact timeline of discovering
[SPEAKER_00]: those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget that day in the library
when I was 14 or 15 going, wait a minute,
[SPEAKER_00]: this does not add up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point that's when,
you know, a cannabis activist was born in
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been something that,
you know, our parents and our parents'
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and our teachers and our future
teachers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was something for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was old man shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a couple of squares of acid,
a 40 of malt liquor, reds and a joint for
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was good, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, I had stories down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I tend to ramble, especially when
I'm on the side.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's that I had a similar experience
growing up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like weed was always around, but it was
always like, it wasn't a drug to us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we were into drugs and that was like,
okay, yeah, we'll smoke weed, but it was
[SPEAKER_06]: to, you know, come down off this or in the
meantime of getting this or that,
[SPEAKER_06]: it was always just kind of there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it took a long time for me to find the
same passion that I have now is similar to
[SPEAKER_06]: your story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once that happened and once I got a
little older and started meeting the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual growers instead of their kids,
you know, and talking about cannabis while
[SPEAKER_00]: we sat around smoking, it got more
interesting and more interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I was introduced to more
strains that, that really piqued my
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It piqued me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even when I started in the mid
nineties, when I started growing just full
[SPEAKER_00]: on full time, it was, we had one strength
and I was blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't give it to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, our closest friends the first
couple of years had no idea we were the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones who were growing this killer weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met, I know you're a strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how blue, old blue is from,
from, from Delta.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people would travel together
during the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us would work up their seasonal,
you know, firefighting, working out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: woods with geologists, exploratory
geologists, looking at gold mines,
[SPEAKER_00]: shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then go wherever we wanted in the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them go snowboarding, you know,
in Utah or wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this one winter, three people from
Delta came with me down to Portland to
[SPEAKER_00]: where I had my established circle of
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them was the guy who gave me
the blueberry cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: His stepdad was the guy who gave me the
blueberry cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bill knew that I had spent the previous
winter growing blueberry in Portland,
[SPEAKER_00]: went back home, worked, Billy came with us
and my partners already had the blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: going when we got back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing we did when I got
there, we had to fix the ventilation on
[SPEAKER_00]: the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, Bill, come on up with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got to fix the ventilation for the
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we go, we, we smoked a joint of
blueberry climbed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ladder went, started fixing the
ventilation from our flower chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Billy looks around and goes,
Ooh, one of your neighbors is baking
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry muffins.
[SPEAKER_00]: How high are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I've seen so many blues DJs,
you know, I've seen so many blues from
[SPEAKER_00]: them and none of them are close to what
that blueberry was, which is what old dude
[SPEAKER_00]: says about every old strain, you know,
absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, every place that clone has been,
people still tell stories about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a clone that floated around
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: As well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, I don't, it's old and it's also
called old blue.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's also maybe not connected to DJ
short as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it could be, it could be things
did not end well in Portland for a group
[SPEAKER_00]: of us because there was other drugs still
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one guy besides me who had access to
it could have let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to this day, he's still on the
needle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he hasn't, so I got to judge his
trustworthiness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very possible, but, uh, there was,
there was a couple blueberries in Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bunch of hippies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had no idea if it had survived or
not until this past year when my sister
[SPEAKER_00]: got ahold of my childhood best friend,
his mother on Facebook and they put the
[SPEAKER_00]: two of us in touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sent him a picture of my flower room
and he immediately sent back a picture of
[SPEAKER_00]: his, uh, and it was just captain old blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you're shitting me,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's still got it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get that down this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my immediate plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right now I'm fucking around with
those seeds I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that guy from Wales sent back to me,
uh, the dad blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I get those out of the way,
I got to get an OG out here in Mexico,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's killing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's easy enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I I've got it in the works right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get it done before summertime
summer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't ship clones out here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's the same here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same like nightmarishly hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing lives in mail.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, I'll, I'll probably talk
to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, he said he's willing to, to send it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some hesitancy at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, uh, you know, sometimes what's
hall of fame in your mind is exactly over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm old enough to know that sometimes
just leave that alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then your show last year, when that,
when that viewer from North pole started
[SPEAKER_00]: typing in blueberries, I was like,
shit, if my hometown is still known for
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry pot, then yeah, I'm pretty sure
it'll hold up just fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I, I love all blueberries, even though
I feel like I've got the best.
[SPEAKER_06]: I still want all of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to experience all of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I hear about, especially the older
ones, it may not even be related or
[SPEAKER_06]: tangentially.
[SPEAKER_06]: Related or whatever the DJ's lines,
you know, I'll say this about DJ's lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every blue smell I ever smelled from them
wasn't really blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's not a giant pool of DJ shorts
blueberry that I'm drawing from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many samples from how
many growers I grew his stuff once it was
[SPEAKER_00]: actually across.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, uh, it was Dr. Atomic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember those things pretty fondly
actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were some good blues that circulated
Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: There really were different selections
down with DJ stuff, bigger selections down
[SPEAKER_06]: in Canada by different dudes up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and they did pull out some really
good blues, but they were, they were few
[SPEAKER_06]: and far between and hard to get.
[SPEAKER_06]: Down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, uh, they were, they always seemed
more fond of the, the fruit terpenes in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, you know, even before the forums,
you could tell the Canadian seed
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, they were all selling berries
of various types.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what was your first forum experience?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where did you first come into the forums?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, cause I know you're, you're,
um, technically technically
[SPEAKER_06]: technologically retarded in some aspects.
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you end up on the forum so early?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was that, that same time period
that I did the, uh, the sub Rob at Hotmail
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came up with that, it was,
it was on that computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really the first time I'd been on a
computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd been out, but I just, I was busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I started looking for pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first two things I found were who
was, who was it who had heroin back in the
[SPEAKER_06]: day, motor rebel and, um, wood horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like the first pot,
anything on the internet I ever found.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, holy shit, this guy's selling
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I overgrown right after that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what was your experience like there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I never.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a point where.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did register.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, I was super paranoid still back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a time period when he didn't
have to be registered to view everything
[SPEAKER_00]: on overgrowth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at some point they made an upgrade
where it was only limited access.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people all registered as like
unregistered 1701.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was one of those unregistered guys for a
little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, then around,
[SPEAKER_01]: when did I sign up at IC mag?
[SPEAKER_01]: When did IC mag start?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in the 2000, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: 2007, 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it started in 2002 or 2003
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I registered in 2006.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, that was the coolest
cannabis experience I ever had outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual growing and smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was, you know, high times may be
a joke now, the fact that high times was
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much my only source of information
for a decade and a half should,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think you look back some of
those old high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that magazine was not only
respectable, as far as I'm concerned,
[SPEAKER_00]: they had Pulitzer worthy content back then
that would have never been considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when the qualifications for what it
takes to, you know, to qualify for awards
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, they had it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had it all.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: Early high times was amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the best, even some of the best
strain reviews you could ever find,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, back from all the, or,
or the connoisseur, they had cool punk
[SPEAKER_06]: rock stuff too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they were very punk rock oriented in
the seventies, which I thought was
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting and metal and metal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't just the dead, you know,
it wasn't just Led Zeppelin the dead in
[SPEAKER_06]: the doors, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, it was all all inclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I, uh, I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was like what I looked
forward to most each month was high times
[SPEAKER_00]: mag coming out, you know, and you,
you'd catch your dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Playing through it and reading it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, uh, it really conveyed that
sixties and seventies outlaw culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just hippie culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the cocaine ads and shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the cocaine ads all over the place in
the old high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I mean, they were writing about
Ricky Ross before Ricky Ross got busted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they were writing about the whole
conspiracy of behind around Ricky Ross
[SPEAKER_00]: before, before anybody else was,
they were a good man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you concerned about your,
you know, personal safety at all in this
[SPEAKER_02]: time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how did it feel to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure both felt like it must've felt
empowering, but also like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: were you scared?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we got on, I see when I really
started going at it in the form,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, by prop two 15, you know, and I didn't
give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, come, come find me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you're seeing everything I'm
doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, pictures up every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think you're going to come find
a warehouse behind me, no, I like my job
[SPEAKER_00]: too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, here's my tents, you know,
so I, I wasn't worried at that point at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, come get it in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understood exactly where somebody with
25 or 30 flowering plants ranked on the
list of shit that the locals or feds
needed to get done and get busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the early 2000s, California,
if you were going, growing 25 plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody gave a shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I felt too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, my paranoia almost
completely disappeared.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when does, when does the sub Rob's
madness cut the San Diego madness cut
[SPEAKER_06]: float through?
[SPEAKER_06]: What year is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I started getting that in 1999.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a big San Diego cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: One guy had it, one grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also bred it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, uh, it was Oregon, big bud crossed
with an indica that he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I started getting it from this kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: His, his girlfriend worked with mine and,
uh, he came over and started selling me
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also got bull rider P 91 Betsy hogs
breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got every cap, every strain that came
through San Diego, this 16 or 17 year old
[SPEAKER_00]: kid that access to, um, I never found out
who it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never cared.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wasn't trying to get a better
deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure I don't run out of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then I started growing again and
this kid would always ask me about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was always interested in cannabis and
cannabis history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the guy who was selling him
madness decided to retire and move back to
[SPEAKER_00]: humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I ain't taking this along with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, he was old.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, I guess he was like, and he told,
he told my friend, Hey man, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody who, who will take care of this
long and appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, I got just a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's still one of my favorite
cuts, not the most potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, he wasn't going to knock any of
the, the really well known San Diego cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, off the top of the mountain,
except for in you, I've never had,
[SPEAKER_00]: never had a cut yielded like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the chart profile like on it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the scent profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, uh, leathery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was in that leathery,
you know, kind of suede, uh, new suede,
[SPEAKER_00]: new leather, you know, that smells very
hard to describe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very hard, but, uh, it was definitely
unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, tasted just like it smelled and it had
a good, solid, good, solid high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: But do you have any idea what it might've
been crossed to like with all your years
[SPEAKER_06]: of experience now, looking back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't have a guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had other, I've had the other strains
that, that fit into that leathery,
[SPEAKER_00]: leather, tennis ball suede.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, uh, the perfect pearl cross that
you sent me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but it's not a profile that,
that you see a lot, you know, definitely
[SPEAKER_06]: not nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had like a, like an aftertaste too,
which is always good with cannabis strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had the, not the taste, but you know
how strong immediately evokes magchampa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magchampa.
[SPEAKER_00]: This invoked the texture of cologne to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily, not necessarily a
specific scent, but just the after effects
[SPEAKER_00]: of cologne.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're doing fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this is good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, this is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: When did you first run into listen,
let's go through a little list.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, P 91, your experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I moved to San Diego, moved
permanently to San Diego in 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I happened to stumble into, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my friends in San Diego that I had
made prior to moving there permanently
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't, weren't really smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all trained.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it, it isn't hard if you're out
drinking to meet somebody in ocean beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they get you a sack of P 91,
you don't lose that number.
Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: The relationship.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how about hog's breath?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got that kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kid who basically became my pot
dealer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he, he had access to everything pretty
much as soon as I met him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, let's see, that was Jennifer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, yeah, it's like 2000.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, he just started every
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd bring me a selection and then,
you know, we didn't, not everybody had the
[SPEAKER_00]: frame of reference of strain names back
then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so it wasn't, you know, your dealer
didn't show up and say, Oh, I got P 91
[SPEAKER_00]: killer green, but right here, 91,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I don't know which was first,
but I remember they all came from that one
[SPEAKER_00]: guy and he was only dealing for a couple
of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I met him before he moved on to more
lucrative things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that my experience with all
those San Diego strings pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: started almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know we've moved on from the P
91, but I didn't want to ask cause it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a name and it's a cut that still
floats around in the group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I'd like to know like your
impressions of it from back then,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, how would you have described it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's the S one that's still floating
around.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the S one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, you know, it was, I did a small
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember when I got the cut had to
be probably, I don't know, 2003 or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I got the cut and I noticed something,
a specific effect that I got when,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did was I had a few guys that I
shared with that I hooked up and two or
[SPEAKER_00]: three in particular who did not know each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, I gave them each a sack for
feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like anything specific, no matter how
weird or how corny or how important
[SPEAKER_00]: unimportant you might think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, they were separate and all
three of them came back to me with the
[SPEAKER_00]: same exact thing that I had noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was when I smoked P 91,
I slept better than any other time in my
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had the most intense dreams.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and I hadn't even so much as hinted
to any of the, actually, I think it was
[SPEAKER_00]: two guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I had never said a word about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, what are they called?
[SPEAKER_00]: A blind test.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both came back and the only thing
they had to say about it was the sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, the dream effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, as far as other thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first thing that always
comes to mind when I pick P 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, based to me, I remember the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the feel of the flowers,
everything in mind, the term oily to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very oily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's not always a good, you know,
that's not always a good quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be from hash making perspective
to the strains I've tried that were oily
[SPEAKER_00]: on the flowers like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weren't that great or more CBD than they
were THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 91's case, no, it was, everything was
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a peanut oil or just straight
associated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I'd say oily and good bedtime
meds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's strong shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even the S one kept that, that potency
where like people compare it to KMD type
[SPEAKER_06]: potency, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of S ones and that,
that P 91 S one that, who is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insane when he posts it or anybody.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a sick one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I'd say that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask if, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you, whether you'd, um,
actually gotten to try the, the S one that
[SPEAKER_02]: floats around or if it's just something
that you've seen from a distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that kind of popped up in San
Diego after I'd already left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been out here a few years now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Were you, were you one of the people?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, no, I think it was grow tech and
someone else when someone claimed to have
[SPEAKER_06]: the original P 91 and had a bunch of
people show up to a collective.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, sorry, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he got all mad at everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't grow tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that was grow tech.
[SPEAKER_06]: Might've been someone else.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, so it wasn't grow tech that popped
up with a cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grotech was one of the people I think that
went better went a few other people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to inform the duty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't have what he thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're talking relatively recent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the past few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that must've happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, after, after I left two or three
years, two or three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I'm still in touch with all those guys
were on group threads and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't, I don't really know about
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about how you met some of those
dudes on, on, uh, San Diego's finest cuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's probably what I think of,
like the most, uh, seminal influential,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, threads throughout all of IC mag that
of course that one jumps out to me because
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in San Diego for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and it was kind of partial to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then some of the guys, but for you,
like, how did you all kind of form into a
[SPEAKER_06]: crew of sorts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, uh, it started with, uh, a guy,
what was arts Drago or, or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: D R A G O R Drago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He and I were talking about it and we
said, uh, eight, you know, eight
[SPEAKER_00]: obligation expert had just, you know,
started moving clones, selling clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had got, I've gotten some,
some other people that I talked to three
[SPEAKER_00]: DM through DMS had gotten some,
uh, and we were, and me and, and drag or
[SPEAKER_00]: started talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, Hey, let's start a thread on,
on IC mag that specifically this guy's
[SPEAKER_00]: hooking us up, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: By that time we'd flower, we'd been
through a couple of flower cycles with his
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts and they were, they were insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was some of the dude.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we said, let's start a thread,
um, showcasing everything that he's got
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll advertise for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, even though it's just California,
you know, and, uh, it, the thread started
[SPEAKER_00]: going, uh, the same people started showing
up every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at some point, you know, I used to,
I used to get every UFC that came on
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had at the time, what was big screen
TV, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, C B L E D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I invited some guys over for,
and my buddy who owned a Submarina,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, brought us a big six foot sub,
uh, for everybody just chow down on,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and we started getting together to
watch every UFC fight and sample each
[SPEAKER_00]: other's wares, which, you know,
started the network, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you grow this, you flower this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll flower this so that, you know,
you didn't have to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember I'd never had access to cuts
like, like this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was 2003, 2004 or, or no,
no, probably a little later than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we were already on IC max.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's call it go six.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was still popping seeds in San
Diego and growing until I got the madness
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then I met eight and hit the
bullet and said, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to trust this dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to buy cuts from somebody I'm
not related to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I was blown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I had, I had the eight at the
time, four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had probably 35 moms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: One cut Rob the 35 cut Rob.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so that's how it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you're sharing information
like that anonymously, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just start going to the get togethers
at Rob's watch the fights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me tell you, everybody was always
trying to outdo everybody in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: times we'd have the get togethers and even
gypsy warned us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, Hey man, have you get
togethers, but you got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, law enforcement is probably,
you know, looking at the shift that
[SPEAKER_00]: leftover paranoia from anybody over 30 at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like prop 15 prop two 15 go fuck
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We suck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're done with that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and that's how that's how it
started, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everybody would come over to my
house and everybody would bring like an
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce of flour, big chunks of hash bubble
hash, you know, edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody would leave after like four
hours and I would stumble down into my
[SPEAKER_00]: kitchen the next morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the dining room table is like,
you know, five grand worth of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happened every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the group was slowly growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would tell people, Hey, if you see
it on this table, take it on your way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of weed, but everybody was
still polite and getting to know each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up with so much more than I
could ever smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many strings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fast through that group and that that's
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're all still friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, nobody in that group ever got
busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody, you know, no rat, no one ever
ratted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still in touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have made it in legal weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others have made it in black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who were part of that, you know,
that original group KRD, uh, he's killing
[SPEAKER_00]: it as he always has a Sean on,
you know, Grace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turned out to be a really great group
and always learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went on that thread back in the day
and you started spouting some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd get spurred and slapped down by
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who started that was a big,
bigger tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember him?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big herb tree.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big herb tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the one who started us on that path
of, of brutal honesty and criticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we all, at least I learned,
I learned so much from being on that
[SPEAKER_00]: thread.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really realize how, how
influential ape was in the, in the thread.
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew he was, you know, part of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't realize how influential he was in
that group.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause it's funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause like he had, he was influential on
me as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he really, really hooked me up early
on with clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: It, you know, like I, I didn't understand
how, how deep of access I was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Given immediately as I got into San Diego.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just drastically different than
any other city I've been to like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just like, bam, bam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's legit from the get-go.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, it was lucky, lucky stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swerve would come down there too.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were partners, weren't they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably at some point or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the shit that guy gets, you know what
I, the only thing I have, the only
[SPEAKER_00]: dealings I ever had was getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swerve cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, from where I came from,
to where I ended up in SoCal in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: two thousands with clone traders.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's okay in my book, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's something else to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have my, I have my different
experiences.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I've never had, I've never had a bad
experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not even that good of a kisser,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: With, uh, with the pictures of his plants
in high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but yeah, man, I love those
clone vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: WIC 650.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: WIC 650.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a part of Cali, Cali connection
too, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or he was involved with getting sort of
his early cuts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those guys were all involved with each
other at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like, uh, just like us
splitting up, you know, flowering duties
[SPEAKER_00]: for new clones amongst the San Diego
finance guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure those guys are like, Hey man,
if you'll take OG, you know, over to San
[SPEAKER_00]: Bernardino for me, I'll drop GDP off in
the Bay for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just looked at the thread in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one is 2008.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I also thought that I could ask you
about some of the other cuts that were
[SPEAKER_02]: around, um, sour dub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a damn good cut, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, I've had it coming
back with the OG that I've got coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, uh, got OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what label comes with an OG,
but I'm anyway, I'm wandering off your
[SPEAKER_00]: path again, thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's our double.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one very fast plant to grow only plan
that I take early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I take everything until it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let it finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't go 70 days and sour double is
not done at 62, 63 days, but that's as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as I take her because the, the,
the terpings are going like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, still great when you take 70 when it's
finished, but you don't get any higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: The depth behind doesn't change in two
weeks or like the last two weeks or less.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great breeding stream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remind me what his lineage is guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who was our dub?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sour dub was a, uh, a sour bubble from bog
cross to, and there's some debate,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, on whether it was NYCD.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it was NYCD cause it has a
lot of sour diesel type notes in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was pretty sure it was res dog,
sour diesel, IBL.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why there's confusion because res rat had
them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you, I've gone back and
forth and so is grace school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sean crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is everybody who's been growing her,
you know, on and off since she came to be.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, there are times when you
really got her dialed in that a,
[SPEAKER_00]: that a sour grapefruit, like red
grapefruit smell is in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're growing NYCD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things she was known for
red grapefruit and I've smelled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, the sour that you
smell is so traditionally, and I heard
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no sour diesel in NYCD.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not.
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not, but in sour double,
there is a sour, no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes back to, to beam from that
original sour diesel gene pool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've got it to go super skunky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I don't really hear people talk about
that much with it, but I've gotten to go
[SPEAKER_06]: super, super skunky to where it was just
like bright in that skunky zone with sour
[SPEAKER_06]: in that, you know, the sour dub.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was gnarly.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was gnarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour dub is, is a great plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The official story, there's lots of
variations out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The story is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bog gave a handful of seeds at a NorCal
music festival of some point to a,
[SPEAKER_00]: to a gangster, to, to a, to a gang member.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did not know that some big dude at a,
at a music fest and Bog was feeling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, it will be the best pot
you've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became a staple of that crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, our, our boy, Grayskull knew one of
the guys in that crew and he gave it to
[SPEAKER_00]: Grayskull and said, Hey man, you got to
change the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, nobody can know that you have this
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like hash plant, but cash because they
were just serious money off this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so Grayskull gave it to a couple of
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In, you know, circle, uh, whoever wasn't
full at the time of all the strains they
[SPEAKER_00]: could handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started growing it and by the first
harvest, everybody was making room for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody made room for sour double in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, we got to come up with the name
of we're going to, you know, talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: this online because that's the one
stipulation that, that Gray has to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to stick with is not to call it cash
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at one point Bog was consulted and
he said, I'd just call it double salad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I was like, that's good enough
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grayskull said, that's good enough for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of the younger dudes who was
always thinking, you know, he,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was, he was probably 15 years,
my junior, and he kind of knew what was
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up with social media hadn't really
started yet, but the younger, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's, let's put something more marketable
than double sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he suggested sour double instead of
double sour, because the S came before the
[SPEAKER_00]: D and he said, it'll always be associated
with San Diego now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all took a vote and sour double
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's called sour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that wasn't, you know, I remember
when I first got the cut, I dropped it
[SPEAKER_06]: immediately without flying.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I was like, Oh, this sounds boring.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would just be like another sour bubble.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I really regretted that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I could have had it much earlier on,
you know, and ran through with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, uh, that's crazy weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I still grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh dude, wait, pop some of those skank
dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get into that later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the crosses that you just
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was, I got double specifically,
uh, because I wanted to reverse it
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to cross SSH and sour double.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever since I heard about SSS.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought that would be a great
mergey of, of Terby, of smell of takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I got the SSH back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the double back from gray.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk real quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me cut you off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about the SSH.
[SPEAKER_06]: The history behind it real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's pretty commonly referred to as 98
SSH now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think crazy is calling another one 97.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think saw cut maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Old SOG 97.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm talking about the SSA,
the 98, when that cut came to me and Sean
[SPEAKER_00]: from a guy in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he gave us the cut among other cuts,
he told us it was the one that won the cup
[SPEAKER_00]: in 98, the high time scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that we took that at every
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy gave us was exactly what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy knew people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought there was that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the first time I heard different was
not so pointing out when he's every time
[SPEAKER_00]: he saw pictures of it and, and heard it
being harvested at day 65, day 70 at the
[SPEAKER_00]: latest and being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you know, that doesn't sound
like the night or look like the 1998 cup
[SPEAKER_00]: winning cut of SSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from everything that he said,
and he sent some pictures, I immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped calling it the cup winning cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think more people know about that cut
from crazy composers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or than anyone else.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: A bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you immediately, you know,
after talking to not so I noticed he also
[SPEAKER_00]: started calling it 98.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's kind of become the
common moniker of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got it from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were told it was Shanti's personal cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say this about that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit Shanti up on Mr. Nice forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, Hey man, I just got 98.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supposedly I just got 98 company cut from
a guy in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Shanti hit me back immediately and
said, well, did it come with a number?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, it did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, if that is given out to anybody,
the person giving it to them must give
[SPEAKER_00]: them the number, you know, whatever the
number was, maybe it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trey position when Shanti was growing,
what it was, but it did not come with the
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, uh, I read the email and I said,
okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we'll see, we'll see what it's
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 15 minutes later, I got a call from
the guy in Canada who said, Hey man,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got a call from Scott or Scott.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got Scott that I'm handing out his
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so the guy who gave it to me never
retracted that it was the company cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it, it seems to me that there was a
break in the communication between Shanti
[SPEAKER_00]: and this store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they just had them mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell you this, it's an excellent cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a, everything that I used to read
about super silver Hanes in Mark Emery's
[SPEAKER_00]: seat catalog or since catalog,
it fits that description to a T and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: fast and it's effortless.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it grows itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give it the bare minimum of what it
needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to get a big gorgeous
plant SSH.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about scent profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the scent profile on that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon, you know, it's got the lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that cedar haze to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those would be the three things I would
describe, but I've never been very good at
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always relied on the other guys and
that's the up for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but cedar haze lemon, I think is a
pretty good summation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that sounds right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got tired of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's because I grew so
much of it there before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you walk into a room full of that
stuff and it's drowning out other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was either that or, you know,
I smoked a lot of it and most of what me
[SPEAKER_00]: and my business partner were smoking at
the time was Ken and OG.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've got to be pretty stout to
keep up with Ken's and the OGs and it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've never been that much of a sativa
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it, they, it definitely leans
sativa, but the true sativa heads will
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you it's too indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's short flowering,
pretty, pretty thick flowers, good yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a nice, a nice indica sativa mix.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a good, like a good soup for summer
hay should be, you know, five skunk one
[SPEAKER_06]: haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way, one of the ways we judge bud
was by how much we had to smoke to get
[SPEAKER_00]: through the Raiders for a few seasons,
pretty intolerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had to smoke a lot of SSH to get
through some of those Raider games.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we pretty much, you know, G for the,
for the bleaker of the years there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in summation, that's, that's the cut
that you used in cross to a reversed sour
[SPEAKER_06]: dub, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: First, the sour dub, your juices,
the shit I'll say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I got, I got, I mean, I'm still
scraping off the surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, ironically, that cross is not at all
what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found enough that I was looking for
in that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I found was if you like super
silver haze, which seems everybody besides
[SPEAKER_00]: me and my buddy, you know, yeah,
super silver haze, then what you'll find
[SPEAKER_00]: in two thirds of the plants will be super
silver haze, but a little bit fatter and a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more body in the stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was an improvement, but,
but the ones that I'm really interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: is the one out of three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, uh, I did what I'd describe it as
the nineties seat catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stock photo of Hayes hybrid.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It longer flowering 18 to 90 days,
big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't like small containers at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put them in big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but flowers that came from those
things are pretty insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked nothing but that phenol of SSH
for like four months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a special cut, especially when you're
not used to really good tivas,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm not, you know, physiology or
what, what is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I pop more of those seeds,
I'll be looking for those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the SSH phenols that came out of it
are so freaking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hash that I made, the hash just falls
off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's why I sent those ones in,
you know, I haven't years, but after a
[SPEAKER_00]: year, year and a half, the reports I've
gotten back from the other growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, okay, that's what I'm just
going to sit on these seeds along with all
[SPEAKER_00]: the other ones in my freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you like SSH, if you are still in
one of those areas where you cannot get
[SPEAKER_00]: clones, that's how I would grade these
seeds is you want to try SSH for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: These seeds are a great way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're not going to find, I don't
think from all the reports I've gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: back, I don't think you're going to find
any sour in SSH sourdough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for sour,
then you look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other hybrids.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about skink dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you're going to find sour.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about the, uh, is it a skunk
dog?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: One used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a skunk dog S one, uh, that I kept
for rounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I went into this phase where I was
going to take it back to the 90s European
[SPEAKER_00]: growing scene where everybody just grew
from seed, didn't keep clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: just keep it moving, exploring all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I ended up getting rid of that S
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really wish I hadn't because that is
a plant that I actually enjoyed growing
[SPEAKER_00]: more than skunk dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, if you followed anything I've done
online from the forums, Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I love Maui skunk dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's one of the greatest hybrids
of all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me years before I reached that
point where I got sick of it and stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking it for a while because it's so
specifically stinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, moved to the S one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the, the word that came to mind,
especially when I grew it, I grew three of
[SPEAKER_00]: them outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, along with a couple of orange juice
bud crosses from, uh, OB.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five or six plants out there and you could
smell them for blocks here in the desert
[SPEAKER_00]: in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really expected the cops to show up and
new medical, you know, at the time new
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational grower laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I hit that with sour double and
everything that I have smelled from that
[SPEAKER_00]: has been, you know, there are strains that
can make your mouth water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I use the term strain today after all
the kerfluffle yesterday online about
[SPEAKER_00]: using strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like just somebody trying to make
his bones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where was this Instagram?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I don't even know what started
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I don't follow the dude who started
it, but I, I'm pretty sure it went back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the old strand versus strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know, you know, but everything I just
described about the last 30 years of my
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have medical textbooks that we
were studying out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a hundred percent gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll say strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say, you know, all the kids can kiss
my ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So skunk dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was in skunk dog?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk dog to the best of my knowledge,
I probably text Sean 50 times a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years asking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I finally remember, I know it's a
Kim D bag seed and I think it's crossed to
[SPEAKER_00]: a skunk from the Island of Molokai.
[SPEAKER_00]: So father, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crossed with a Kim of some sort bag seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ones that I grew, uh, including the one I
kept the Kim is obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never question that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like Kim growing, uh,
except for it kept, if you've ever grown
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk dog, it's got some really weird
branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, uh, it really goes crazy on side
branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants, and I think I've got some
picks up on Instagram, uh, from when I
[SPEAKER_00]: grew them outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like Kim with the exact same
branching from skunk dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that's, that's when I first
started using the descriptor scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it just skanked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you hear our double the
examples I've seen and smelled so far,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I would say that, that if,
if I grew some of these hybrids,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the skank dog out in 1990,
every, I would have sold it as skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been referred to as skunk by
everybody who smoked it or smelled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was in the room with somebody who had a
bag of it in their pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is skunk is the best descriptor,
but I couldn't call it skank dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I called it skank dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that name anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really brought out, amplified the
Kim and added that sweetness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm getting ready to pop some more
Susie's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabby's are cleared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm popping more of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot wait to try something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a tray, a trend in with probably a
half ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I might still actually have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe a half ounce of seeded bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was the, it was the skunk dog flower
with the seeds from the sourdough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My tent for over a year, uncovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, dry right now, but when I found it and
I just kind of crumpled a few seeds out of
[SPEAKER_00]: a flower, the smell hit me and I was like,
Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had to pick just one strain right now
to pop seeds of out of everything in my
[SPEAKER_00]: collection, it would be, it would be more
of the skin.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we talked about on the show,
um, or refer to as like the super skunk
[SPEAKER_06]: double up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if, uh, a cam or sour or something
with super skunk in it is then crossed to
[SPEAKER_06]: something else with sour or cam in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They tend to align and make skunky fucking
shit almost every single time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, it's, it's gnarly.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's, and it's predictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another good example of that was,
uh, Canorado before he, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: started selling seeds, you know,
he was working doing cross and he did a
[SPEAKER_00]: sour double reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, and he hit, I think, every clone
that Colorado has.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he collected everything and he
wanted to send.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to send gray school,
uh, a 10 pack of each one of those sour
[SPEAKER_00]: double crosses to thank him for releasing,
uh, sour double.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so Sean told them at the time,
and I don't mess with post office,
[SPEAKER_00]: but hit up Rob.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll probably do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he doubled up every pack and sent me
and great school, a pack of everything
[SPEAKER_00]: he'd done from Durbin to OGs to all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I popped, I popped either one seed or
three seeds of can be, it was sour double,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, reverse pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a keeper, whether it was the
one seed pop or the three seed pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember which one, but the plan I
ended up with smelled like East coast,
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel on steroids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I got back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Oh nine, it, it had that kind
of sour diesel smell, not, not even a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit watered down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really surprised by that smile.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it makes sense though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember when he did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew those seats for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never explored any gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like I've explored the sour double
gene pool all because can or auto wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to hook graceful up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's always been super cool to me too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like him a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white sour dub is another cut,
uh, which Sean still grows in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that was the other one of them was a
one seat pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was three seat pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I got a deeper cut from each one
of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one was the white sour dub.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it called wobble?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the cut that I kept, we just called
white sour dub.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Sean could be calling something
else, especially with the whole,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the company, maybe, um, or maybe
somebody else kept the cut too,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe can't or auto called it that,
but, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like sour dub cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes around.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you get to grow any gg4 sour double?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder how that one would be growing and
pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, back cross, if you get a little
more sour to me, the one thing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that gg4 kind of lack was, was a distinct
flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and maybe that was a little bit
jaded by the fact that everybody who had
[SPEAKER_00]: sour double at that time was still growing
sour double when, when, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dawn started giving out cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's easier to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It yields more.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than sour dub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but when you're comparing the two,
I mean, I never understood why somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: would take gg4 over sour dub.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had that same point of view.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when gg4 came out, I already had sour
dub.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wasn't really interested in growing
gg4 the first decade of it being out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no interest in it at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: It ended up being a pretty good breeder
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you guys help me out here?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the overlap, uh, in terms of their
genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you compare them?
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's like sour dubs a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't, didn't G didn't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sour double hit with mystery
pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, so they said sour dub
chocolate tie chem sis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know which one came and hit which
or reversed or where they even found chem
[SPEAKER_06]: sis to hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this brings it back to the SDF
threads.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was interesting watching the beginning
of, uh, of gorilla gorilla blue number
[SPEAKER_00]: four, because on the forums, you can see
the blueprint for the modern height,
[SPEAKER_00]: typing of a strength marketing blueprint
was burner online with cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember the beginning of gorilla
glue number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Josie wasn't, uh, he wasn't a
marketing machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he wasn't really caring that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was another one or two members
specifically who, who kind of talked to
[SPEAKER_00]: him and it said, Hey man, you've got
something here in today's legal world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't just let something
like this go.
[SPEAKER_00]: For nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make money off of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure those posts would
still be up on, on one of the SDF threads,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the second one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it was really interesting watching
people make suggestions, say you should do
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was, it was kind of interesting
watching the beginning of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing from, from the way it was done
prior to burner doing this thing with
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the guys who'd been smoking the
longest would tell the young guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what you want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, your friends would tell you,
Hey man, I just found this, this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that turned around with cookies,
cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The height came before the flower for 90%
of the people who were, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're on your second grow of all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in the beginners forum and you're
telling me the cookies is the best pot in
[SPEAKER_00]: the history of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I was always getting a little
grouchy back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don understood, especially with grilled
blue number four, still think it's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if people enjoy it, who gives a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 13, but I seem like I'm the only person I
know who can't stand has plant 13 things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do miss the back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do miss people being able to criticize
each other without 130,000 people sliding
[SPEAKER_00]: into your fucking DMS telling me,
you know, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they were.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tended to get banned from every forum
because of my fucking mouth, but you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Editing all this to a coherent format for
your ship.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be, it'll be interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also wanted to ask about the a dub and
whether that has any relation or is that
[SPEAKER_02]: just a coincidence with the name?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, a dub is sour double hit with a
alien dog V2 or V1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that OB did with alien dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably the V1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if it was OBS or no, no, you know
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was grow tech and, uh,
this other dude who came onto it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairly early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having trouble remembering his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of embarrassed about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a project they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the people who got the seeds,
uh, KRD was one of them and KRD found a
[SPEAKER_00]: dub and he was just listed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was like a dub,
a dub, C dub, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that were kept were a dub,
O dub and something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sour double hit with alien dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's, that's a very specific
type plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's got a unique high, the way I
interpret it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, uh, smoking yourself into a
bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, I can't tell you how many
days I was working in the garden and I
[SPEAKER_00]: would smoke a dub and, and I would find
myself wandering like the stereotype from
[SPEAKER_00]: the eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what am I doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was I mixing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I, I did halfway and hadn't
finished yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something right beside it on the work
bench, that should just put you into a,
[SPEAKER_00]: another state of B that's like smoking
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't buy into all the 30% this 28%
this 30, but when people were first
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to get things tested,
I think that was the second cut that I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: come up with a 30% read.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, you know, the reason I don't put
any stock into it is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are adjustable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about where the machine is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Balanced that now there are uses for it,
of course, you know, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and selecting phenotypes and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's another thing I remember about
a dub was I think that was the second time
[SPEAKER_00]: behind Bruce Banner that anybody dared to
say, I got 30% DHC on getting laughed at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the one that made me believe,
Hey, I don't know if it's 30, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely something up in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great strength.
[SPEAKER_06]: How about, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: We mean, you've talked about it a bunch,
but I don't think most people outside of a
[SPEAKER_06]: few of us really know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dabney blue Dabney blue was something
Sean had more experience with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he brought over some, some of the
Dabney Afghani Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, that's near I've smelled
besides old blue from, from Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a deep blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was, uh, it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what the original Dabney
blue was like, which is also from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's from, uh, remember I got ahold of the
guy or he got ahold of me somehow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was like mini Frisbee golf course name.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Never got the original back though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh wait, no, I take that back.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is in the circle.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if, I don't know if I'm ever
allowed to touch it yet, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the crosses I made with that
was, uh, East coast sour Dabney.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shot over some pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a male male Dabney blue Afghani
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought over some pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went up to my tent and hit East coast
sour diesel with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made a bunch of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a lot of that pollen on the East
coast sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hit a few other things with the
purple joy, which was a purple plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: was kind of purple plant that I dug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that deep, perfumey Afghani.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in Nepalese, um, Nepalese Afghani
hybrid, if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that makes sense too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Nepalese.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but it had that purple flavor that I
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really go for the GDP so much,
the grapes, but I like those old,
[SPEAKER_00]: those old perfumey, stinky small buds,
but it don't take much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those purples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so he brought over the pollen,
uh, the F1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent most of them to the server fund
auction for ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among the other other people who bought
them was a guy who went by Brando MK and
[SPEAKER_00]: he had been head of something for prime
wellness in Pennsylvania, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: league, I guess a big ass company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he happened to take the seeds in there
and pop them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They became prime wellness property as far
as he was concerned, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as he could say, these are my
personal stash, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but they, to this day, they still run
two Finos that they call sweet blue,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, sour blueberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make all the concentrates out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go through the, uh, matter of fact on
their website, they have it listed as sub
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob's sour diesel, um, which it wasn't sub
Rob's sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was our diesel clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that, you know, I had marked
on his packaging was sub Rob, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then he sold across with them in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I've got going.
[SPEAKER_00]: A guy in Wales, bottom in like 2010,
he lives in Wales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he, he told me, uh, he told me,
he says, I've got tens of thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars of seeds in my deep freeze that I
never got to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, some of them are yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't I just send them back your way?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six going in the, in the bench tent right
now in perpetuity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cracked them like eight months ago and
I've just been recycling moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I haven't, I haven't flowered.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's been going on for a while,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I've got to, I got to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got OG and sour double coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to, it's real interesting when
you're running literally just personal
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went from having enough room and we
weren't even big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had no stage in my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would I be considered a big time
commercial grower by today's standards?
[SPEAKER_01]: Same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done compares to the a hundred
lighters, 200 lighters, thousand lighters,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I used to have room for stashing
anything I wanted cracking seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an extra tray over there in the
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different when you are, when you're
just running a little five by 10 by eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask you, cause obviously we
have, we have lots of different clones
[SPEAKER_02]: than names that we could ask you about,
but I did want to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you were, you know, just referring
to your current situation, like what are
[SPEAKER_02]: you working on now?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, what, what do you think the
future holds for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of, um, the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right now I'm not working on anything,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, I've been smoking the SSH dub for
going on a total of the last harvest of it
[SPEAKER_00]: for like six months now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just started going over to another,
when I moved down here to New Mexico,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's another old time, I see Magger
that I've known forever online who lives
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go by and get samples for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it's just, it just really slowed
down the flowering schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus I kind of, I grew a little more than
I needed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't, I don't, I don't sell weed
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well I've been the real work I've been
putting in is judging that SSH dub lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I do have plans for every three
sets of plans I make.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually carry out one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next thing I'm going to do is see
if this East coast sour dab me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was worth doing a senior increase
and see, I got, this goes back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I am derailing conversation again.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was living in Valley Senate around
2013, 2015, maybe my house got burgled and
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a bin with every crop I'd ever made,
um, not to mention all my friends had ever
[SPEAKER_00]: made anything I'd ever bought traded for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in them, I had a, a whole bunch of
those of both F1 and F2 East coast sour
[SPEAKER_00]: dab me that I had always planned,
uh, because of the success that prime
[SPEAKER_00]: wellness had with 10 of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always had plans to work that line and
maybe do some real actual breeding work
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but the thief along with a bunch of
other shit got all the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to find out just how stiff these
East coast sour diesel genetics come
[SPEAKER_00]: through in these seeds and just how our
core, the dab me Kush does, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: and see if it's worth trying to,
to increase and do something with those.
[SPEAKER_01]: These suck bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: These always fucking shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want, I want to do another sour dub
reversal because I missed some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, I didn't get the, the Kennedy
cut in time when I made those seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: going back to that, that plant I got from
Canorado, it can be with sour dub.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: These sour dub crosses are something that
I've begged.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends who make and sell seeds to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to do any of this stuff and
I wanted to move on, but the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: world, the demand in the industry seems to
have moved on from some genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: prematurely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying, Hey, you know,
go get the sherbets and the biscottis and
[SPEAKER_00]: the biscuits and the whatever hell else
pastries are out there, but don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a little bit, you know,
because there's a lot of the, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the cuts that came in the era of
the forums that we should still be
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrating on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I don't, I don't,
I don't want to take the journey away
[SPEAKER_00]: from, from everybody, but at least a small
percentage of people need to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back and start working with the sours
and the M's and the OGs because those are
[SPEAKER_00]: gene pool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And oddly enough, I've talked about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I have people hitting me up all the
time asking for OG cuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause nobody kept them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like not nobody, but in a lot of people,
enough people dropped them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then a lot of these big places that these
people used to run, like they don't even
[SPEAKER_06]: have OGs anymore, not pure OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gets us circled back to SDF,
which is the, the, the thread I'm supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to be staying on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all had at one point, not only did all
the P 91 bull rider, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all we all had, not just one, but we all
had all those cuts in your bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had P 91 in your bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had madness in your bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had hogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, lame eight, I really do
because I wasn't the one who had never had
[SPEAKER_00]: access to that many cuts, you know,
at one time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only one who went crazy and would
just get cuts from eight and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegem and flower room in a tent with 14
other kinds of a single plant each,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, of 15, 15 different cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you would just, you know,
move on from them and you wouldn't keep
[SPEAKER_00]: moms because you got another 20 from
eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and basically we all thought that P
91 would stick around and they just up and
[SPEAKER_00]: disappeared in the matter of like a year
and a half.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn shame.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know what we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like being cut drunk, you know,
we all just ate that shit up and forgot
[SPEAKER_00]: about a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cycle repeats itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how it goes, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always thought everything was going to
be around forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause maybe this is almost more for Matt,
but when I look at, you know, I went
[SPEAKER_02]: through some of the threads and filed a
whole list of, of clones that stood out to
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I look at some of the names,
you know, Chernobyl, strawberry cream,
[SPEAKER_02]: day record, it also strikes me that of
course this is some of these are some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the cuts that Matt worked with earlier as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, it's difficult to make that
connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't, I didn't actually realize,
I don't think I liked that strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: cream.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You, you would have run the same exact
clone that I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause mine came by eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was great, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: If for a strawberry, it was fucking mega
strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I would get cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure everybody did for me where
something went wrong and the other
[SPEAKER_00]: information wasn't passed right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember calling one Bob,
which said for body odor, Barry,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious what other cuts did you come
up with from those threats?
[SPEAKER_02]: What else did you come up with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've already mentioned P91 or hugs
breath bull rider.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I saw it at GDP, great bay,
cat piss, purple, kush, green,
[SPEAKER_02]: ice, Albert Walker, Chernobyl,
uh, strawberry cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: We mentioned old Betsy master crush.
[SPEAKER_06]: Green crack.
[SPEAKER_06]: Green crack was a big one down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So green ice was something that was around
for a very short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Cali green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he had gotten some seeds from the
original GG four, which was gorilla gold
[SPEAKER_00]: for, yeah, by up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was an awesome strain indoor or out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of on the bland side for
indoor weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in Southern California time,
but Cali found a male and he hit green
[SPEAKER_00]: crack along with a couple other cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where green ice was born.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a strain that still to this
day, I still, whenever I talk to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Hey man, do remember green ice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I know I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't have lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, but yeah, that was, I remember
the flavor of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't hit that since probably 2007 or
eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I still remember, I remember that,
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bet you not many people remember it,
but, uh, I enjoyed that very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember AK 48 God's gift?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't think I grew it,
but I say that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go through the forums.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did grow that, but I remember growing AK
47.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember growing cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember AK 47.
[SPEAKER_00]: When's the earliest that came out?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when I was in Portland growing,
uh, blueberry, there was one guy that w
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the very few guys we led in our
secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a grower also, and he was growing
these, these newer seeds, uh, AK 47 and
[SPEAKER_00]: white widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had, he'd selected cuts from both
of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was pretty awesome weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never really had AK 47.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lived up to that AK 47 that what's
his name was growing in Portland back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the day.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good strength.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to think, like I've had a few
good AK 47s.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, there was like a lemon AK.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was the, uh, like cedar AK,
but then there's also the cherry AK that
[SPEAKER_06]: went around San Diego and it was
beautiful, frosty, no density to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fluffy and not very potent,
but it was, it was really good tasting.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was about it for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still floating around.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd used it in the cherry berry that I not
too long ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was stoked to see it again, even though
it's not super potent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it is a great breeder, especially for
those turps, cherry cough drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've already, I remember a couple of
the clones you listed thousand,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, popped off in my mind immediately,
but I've already forgotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I think ones we haven't talked
about yet, like maybe Chernobyl or Day
[SPEAKER_02]: Wrecker, Albert Walker, any of those
trouble was a seed line from TGA.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of different kinds of
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Dago Walker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that Walker, uh, Sean,
I think Sean was the one who got that one
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was the Albert, uh, and Fletch,
uh, I think all Fletch even needed to see
[SPEAKER_00]: was the veg picks of that plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, Hey bro, that ain't,
that's not Albert Walker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned out it wasn't, of course he
was, he was right on with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we called the Walker just cause we were
too lazy to cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know if we were going to end up
keeping it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell you what, man, that plant is a citrus
explosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a nice plant, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tried taking the citrus down and not,
uh, the first reverse reversal I ever
[SPEAKER_00]: tried was Tahoe OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had room and I was spraying it every day
and it just wasn't going well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I said, Sean happened to come over
one day and he got in there and he found a
[SPEAKER_00]: pinprick of pollen somewhere on that plant
and he ran upstairs and he hit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he hit, uh, Dago Walker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: With it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he got three seats, grew all three
of them out and one of them was still
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's called cactus cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cooler comes from, and we always swore we
were going to reverse Tahoe or one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: OGs, uh, and hit it again and try to bat
that citrus down a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty full of that in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great how much citrus was from that
one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was bumped when I found out that wasn't
real Albert Walker.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause that was one of the ones that I
fucked with too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, Oh yeah, we've got the
real Albert Walker.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got that down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turned out not to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never smoked, grown, knowingly smoked
Albert Walker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a bummer because like you said,
that's what I was wanting to try.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same.
[SPEAKER_06]: I I've never seen a real one or smoked it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did, or wouldn't even know what it smells
like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing about it really.
[SPEAKER_06]: That one, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's my only experience with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, uh, what was your favorite San Diego
cut?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was so partial to hogs breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably didn't need to, uh,
for sentimental, if nothing else,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and the clockwork one that came
from, uh, Doug crazy Doug down there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doug knew everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was the one who hooked me up with.
[SPEAKER_06]: James in the first place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and the whole hogs breath crew,
but he had a, you know, like there's an
[SPEAKER_06]: Apollo 13 cut he had down there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, he gave me fire OG really early on.
[SPEAKER_06]: He gave me chem D really early on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, yeah, he was, that dude was
connected to everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to ask here and Matt,
maybe this is obvious, but I, I'm just
[SPEAKER_02]: like, it's not clear to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the overlap between the hogs breath
crew and San Diego's finest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in terms of people, were there lots of
crossovers or.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just family.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the, the hogs breath family was
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They ran unified collective in San Diego
and you know, people that you could go in
[SPEAKER_06]: there and talk to him any time due to who,
who just like local groups, basically
[SPEAKER_06]: local, local different groups.
[SPEAKER_06]: And hogs breath was just that well-known
in San Diego that everybody knew it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, it was the staple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, do we want to talk about the bull
rider?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we as everyone's sick of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know anything about bull rider
myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I only ever had a fake bull rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, bull rider probably overall is,
was probably my favorite of the San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause yeah, I love, I love the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smell and the taste was just,
you know, I barely even remembered if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: being honest, but I remember, you know,
when I first got here, I had just come off
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking blueberry for four years straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had become a big thing for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I thought I was a snob,
you know, but I knew what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and bull rider was the one that took
place at the blue rider for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it gave me all the flavor that I
could want from, from a dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour, but not sour diesel perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was really dark.
[SPEAKER_06]: And did old Betsy, did old Betsy cross
your path down there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but you know, I used to get old
Betsy from the same guy who I got
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else from, but here's where
everything differs for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think back to the old Betsy that he
was getting me, I think of really dark,
[SPEAKER_00]: purple, almost black.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't that big a fan, but it wasn't
just once or twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a few times before he even quit
bringing it when he would bring me his
[SPEAKER_00]: little briefcase full of samples and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because I literally thought it was
just a man cut, but I, I had the wonder
[SPEAKER_00]: since then was I getting the real,
but why would he get it?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, all this other legit shit and
not Betsy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turned out to when I had to start going
other places, when I got P, when I got,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, hogs, when I got any of that,
it was the same thing that he used to get
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but then I see old Betsy plants
growing that are green all the way through
[SPEAKER_00]: and being described.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, maybe like he,
he got mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had more than one connect, you know,
there was only one connect that he got
[SPEAKER_00]: madness from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that he went to get old Betsy
from, so I don't know what genuine old
[SPEAKER_00]: Betsy was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I had the real deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, how about blueberry hogs breath?
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember when that came around at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the model, you know,
the name, but I don't know that I ever got
[SPEAKER_00]: any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I, once I see, I got here in 99 and I
wasn't growing right away, but I was
[SPEAKER_00]: growing again by 2001, 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: By then I was no longer, you know,
buying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing enough to keep myself going
year round.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That wasn't, I just remember when that
finally got released and he let it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you could throw a rock and hit it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was in every fucking grow room of
every fucking kid.
[SPEAKER_06]: In San Diego for a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My gross secret from, well, for the years
I was growing in San Diego, I used to,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I used to use, I used to rent
apartments and they had to have a walk-in
[SPEAKER_00]: closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would just basically take about
80% of the closet and build out of
[SPEAKER_00]: styrofoam, a wall that I could just go
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, got pretty good at that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up, it was kind of cool to build
rooms out of styrofoam, small rooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we got to a point where we built,
it had 12 foot ceilings in this building
[SPEAKER_00]: and we built a 16 by 12 by 12 grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of the four walls were just built out
of completely out of styrofoam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We leave the ventilation system on
overnight and suck in the walls or blow
[SPEAKER_00]: the walls out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you just call in a coked out Russian
to frame it in for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate the, uh, the tip on that book
that you told me to get to the,
[SPEAKER_06]: the after Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it called?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it called?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to go into mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to look.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really killer book though.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really well done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanistan, the kingdom of Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar to a Triniacs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The story as it, you know, as it happened,
I'll tell you what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to do people need to do more
episodes on hash on hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, because it's the, there's no
blueprint, you know, and for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: years I was going through your book stash
and explaining what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted the basic blueprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to, okay, this is where you start
when you make cash and this is what you
[SPEAKER_00]: can expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what you should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do that with growing flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that with living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get that in from any aspect of
growing, but for, but for making dry sift
[SPEAKER_00]: hash, it's just not out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't understand, uh,
why it wasn't out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why isn't there a book?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how you make dry sift hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, now I understand because it's,
it's different every single time,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's such fluid art that has done so
many different ways with the same base
[SPEAKER_00]: tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, I think people need to start
talking about hashish more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrates in general, but specifically
dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you've done some beautiful dry sift
stuff that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't like smoking just flower
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as obsessed as I've been with
growing for my entire adult life back into
[SPEAKER_00]: my teens, uh, it is now second seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a step to getting to making
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the penultimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the destination for the first 40
years of my experience with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and now it's just third to the last
step.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you do a damn good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the hashtag, you know, fuck your legal
weed guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I'm happy for everybody who's,
who's getting it going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy that not nearly as many people
are going to jail for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think it's fucking great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I were 25 years younger,
I'd be, you know, I'd be all over it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so nice to be this age where,
see, for example, you don't always want to
[SPEAKER_00]: see behind the curtain, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, grew up a fanatic of Harley
Davidson motorcycles, loved Harley,
[SPEAKER_00]: loved the lifestyle, loved the
fictionalized lifestyle, loved true
[SPEAKER_00]: lifestyle, loved writing all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to work for Harley Davidson and I
still love it, but now I know it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of jobs for a lot of people to
put that image that I fell in love with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so, that takes a lot of work to
keep them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you see that, it just takes a
little edge of the magic off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually opens up a whole new world,
you know, uh, just, well, but with legal
[SPEAKER_00]: weed, I'm actually kind of glad that,
I'm kind of, you know, missed that being
[SPEAKER_00]: the focus of my professional drive,
because now I get to keep magic and I get
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, tell people to go fuck
themselves and, you know, call people,
[SPEAKER_00]: sell outs for everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to take part in anything
where tax money goes to law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably a whole nother episode in
enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you can rant about that shit for
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy with what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, at this point, I'm just talking,
I'm not even thinking of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in New Mexico, I don't even know the
law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally made myself be in her laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if any of the tax goes law
enforcement out here and I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that it just ruins it for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk about losing the magic, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look, they got some really cool shit in,
in the legal scene out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you what, since it went
recreational a couple of years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality has skyrocketed, which doesn't
take much.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you need is a Cali pipeline for cuts,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't partaken at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been in a dispensary out here
in three and a half years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never shopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did look into, they have macro licenses
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, do they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Max is out, I think at a few hundred
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody who is at least zoned right can
make an honest mom and pop shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attempt here in New Mexico, especially in
Southern New Mexico, where everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: the focus is always on mom and pop,
you know, small down here from food to art
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, it's a great place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could develop a really, they could
develop a really cool cannabis seed here
[SPEAKER_00]: in Los Cruz.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd have to chew one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another, another thing that just I'm zero
tolerance on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for personal grow, I can have 12
plants here, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have six in flower, I'm limited to
six in veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to, you want to set the number of
what I can flower at six and charge me a
[SPEAKER_00]: tax essentially for anything above that,
because you'd have to get a macro,
[SPEAKER_00]: a micro license.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't fucking tell me how many goddamn
plants I can have in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that somebody has 10 plants
instead of six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they got six in flower is not going
to influence anybody who isn't going to
[SPEAKER_00]: break your law anyway to break that law.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just, you're not creating
criminals by letting them have 30 or 40
[SPEAKER_00]: veg plants while they search through a
batch seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, this is so small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Town, uh, do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mom and pop restaurants, mom and pop,
everything that if they would let people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, do those circles, find those
spinos develop the habits you need,
[SPEAKER_00]: the experience you need to find special
cuts out of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you let the people do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to organically grow a nice
cannabis seed rather than the cats who
[SPEAKER_00]: moved from Cal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking shit, but there's people
who moved from California out here to New
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even if New Mexico did very well
to make sure it was New Mexico residents
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the licenses, a lot of those
licenses got somebody in the grow room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, from Cali running the whole fuck
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, again, no, not disrespecting anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want everybody's heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but now you're letting those people
dictate what the local scene grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Island on land.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got El Paso over a very
unfriendly state line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got a whole lot of desert for
a whole lot of miles, a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: Indian reservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got Northern Mexico along the
way away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wish they would do away with the
plant count laws as far as vegetative.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't really make a lot of sense,
especially considering like you're not
[SPEAKER_06]: producing any drug content with the veg
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who gives a fuck about the veg plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: People grow more than six without a
license are going to grow more than six
[SPEAKER_00]: without.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's common sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be happy cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to get a micro license.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things you have to do is
present them with business plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't give you the information over
the phone, but I annoyed one of the clerks
[SPEAKER_00]: who works there so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says, okay, pitch me your business
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, my business plan,
she goes, how much money are you going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make in the first year?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, not.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I just want to pop seeds,
man, and be able to sort through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to sell pets of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do any of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I did, I'd do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't fucking tell you anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she's like, you know, that's just not,
you know, your business plan will have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will have to come up with
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'd so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not looking any further.
[SPEAKER_06]: Business plan, bro, we're stoners.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look out of your business plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, it's it's not a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to force people to to consider
these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also we live in a water rights
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's you know, I don't have any
water rights, although I do have a well on
[SPEAKER_00]: on my lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's no longer used, but it qualifies me
to buy water rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm like, look, I'm not going to need
any water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm not going to be growing enough
where I'm just not going to go fill my
[SPEAKER_00]: seven gallon jugs of water down in the
grocery store parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tests less than a million.
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, your business plan just
doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I'm sorry, I just want to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, business plan.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you need a business plan.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to make no money about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I don't know, but I do appreciate some
of the things they're doing here in New
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it being a low populated state,
it allows them to kind of push towards
[SPEAKER_00]: grassroots a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sure they still fund the pigs
somehow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, they do.
[SPEAKER_06]: They always do always find a way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get your cut or it ain't
happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's going to protect you, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's going to keep you safe?
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't get their cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, you know,
it'd be just be a great place,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for any for for Asian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 120 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got plenty of humidity in late
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like you look at pictures
in those books like that book you just
[SPEAKER_00]: got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it looked a lot like my
backyard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks a lot like Bakersfield,
too, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's very similar.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: High temps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It also burns up all the turps,
though, I'd imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it what did I grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew three skank dog or I grew three
skunk dog S1s.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, gee, of some sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit with orange juice bud from Obisul,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, they start this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The everybody knew somebody was drawn by
someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody within a mile radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm kind of downtown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm zoned commercial residential.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not bad enough room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a big ass empty one room casita
out back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had I had the potential to do a cannabis
business if I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, you know, having kind of
missed that window, it allows me to just
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy being all around all time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, do you have any shout out you want
to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you mean like for like like it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any shout out you want to do for the
closing out?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just say, hey, give a shout out to my boy
X, Y, Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows who everybody knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
