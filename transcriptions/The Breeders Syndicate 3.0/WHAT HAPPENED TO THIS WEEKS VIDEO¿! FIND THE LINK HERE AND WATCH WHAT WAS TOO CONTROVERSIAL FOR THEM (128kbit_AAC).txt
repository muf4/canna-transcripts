[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Reader's Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_00]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_00]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_00]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_00]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be wondering where our current
video for this week is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It aired, and then it was taken down about
an hour, hour and a half after airing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was reported erroneously by... Can't
say for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They accused us of drug dealing,
which is laughable since we're a history
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't sell anything on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can imagine, we were showing a
specific seed bank, and their prices are
[SPEAKER_00]: on their website, and we were commenting
on how ridiculous some of the advertising
[SPEAKER_00]: was, so they used that against us.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, even though YouTube is pretty
awful about how they're handling this
[SPEAKER_00]: since we can't appeal it, you will be able
to go to vimeo.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So vimeo.com forward slash nine four seven
six two three nine three zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, vimeo.com forward slash nine four
seven six two three nine three oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can watch a video there in its
full unedited glory.
[SPEAKER_00]: The YouTube version is gonna be audio
only, unfortunately, so you lose a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the context on images when we're talking
about stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted you to be able to go
somewhere where you can still have access
[SPEAKER_00]: to the full video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to go watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we're not gonna be bullied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't scam.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't work with scammers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't be highlighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll always fight back,
and I really don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's gonna slow this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The information will get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just one person anymore that you
can try to stifle, like a lot of you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: did for a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole lot of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that said, yeah, go click the
link.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it in the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully YouTube doesn't take it down,
because we're leaking outside of YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it'll also be up on the screen so
you can see it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just enter it in your, I don't know,
address bar and go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of love.

Discord where we get together and solve
[SPEAKER_00]: old, strange history together daily.

from IG, and it's an amazing resource for
[SPEAKER_00]: old catalogs and knowledge.

growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come check it out.
Thank you.
