[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_05]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_05]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_05]: seat.
[SPEAKER_05]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_05]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_05]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Syndicate is a collection of seed makers
that want to push back against all the
[SPEAKER_05]: smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_05]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Matthew, and I'm here with my co-host,
Thousand Fold, and today we're going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: talking to Big Earns, Spindle,
and Local, all from our Canna Luminati
[SPEAKER_04]: group.
[SPEAKER_04]: So welcome, fellas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thousand, take it away.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, welcome, everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: So sort of like the outdoor growing
episode, we're hoping to start a little
[SPEAKER_08]: like recurring indoor growing series.
[SPEAKER_08]: And today we're bringing on, as Matt
mentioned, some of our homies.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to talk through some,
for this episode, some pretty basic indoor
[SPEAKER_08]: growing topics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then at the end, we'll kind of
conclude with like a more open kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: philosophical question about what people
think makes for a good growth.
[SPEAKER_08]: But to kick things off and to warm
everyone up, I thought we would just go
[SPEAKER_08]: around and talk about how long have you
been growing and what have you been
[SPEAKER_08]: growing recently or now?
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we start with Spindle, Michael.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew my very first plant in 1995,
I think it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just had started some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked at a golf course at the time,
and there was an area off of the 13th hole
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of had some trees and brush that
they didn't clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just put some five gallon buckets
out there with some seeds and grew my
[SPEAKER_00]: first plants that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually came out pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think probably by 96, I started my first
indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I could really call growing,
you know, otherwise it was just a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: plants I'd water a few times during the
summer.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to ask you each, I'm going to
ask each of you more about like the actual
[SPEAKER_08]: journey.
[SPEAKER_08]: But for now, Michael, what have you been
growing recently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I've been growing some Super
Booth, some Sour from Notso, some of
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt's Riot Berry, which was excellent,
some Uppercut from Caleb, some Big Sur
[SPEAKER_00]: from Caleb, and just getting into some new
stuff from Pac, some of the Blue Dreams
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's quite the lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I always have a few Quimby's in
every run.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's a recurring feature of your
runs, huh?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll definitely come back to some of
those plants later.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about Earn?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I probably have been growing the
the shortest period of time out of all
[SPEAKER_02]: these people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been, I started growing in 2001.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just, you know, kind of got like a
clone from a friend that also didn't know
[SPEAKER_02]: what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And gave me spider mites on my very first
grow, you know, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just like really quick,
I've always been like the kind of person
[SPEAKER_02]: that like hops into hobbies, like head
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I am for this,
is just like super hobbyist and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just getting to kind of like
live like my 18 year old like dream of
[SPEAKER_02]: like being able to grow this shit that I
saw on High Times, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so it's been a cool school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as like what I've been running
lately is, you know, stuff from the dudes
[SPEAKER_02]: in the group.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got several Appalachia things going
from High and Lonesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're both East Coast, you know,
and I like really have this like thing
[SPEAKER_02]: about like wanting to support people that
are like local, and like get stuff that's
[SPEAKER_02]: like being bred in my area and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been trying to support that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, he's just like a sick
fucking dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you just happen to be supporting
like one of the best breeders in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easier to support when it's like
dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, so yeah, I have like some
of his like a Bubba times D Appy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a Santa Cruz rep times Appy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some Appy F3 going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just ran his mule skinners.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like really trying to look through
his stuff, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: When are you two going on that fishing
trip?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but soon, hopefully anytime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be real cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's so cute.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm jelly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm jealous too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Local, how long have you been growing and
what are you growing now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I started actually like flowering
plants in 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is that like six, seven years?
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now, currently, I'm running some
Asterix Death Star, Band-Aid Haze 7,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then Santa Cruz Direct number six from
pack.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no reason to be putting Asterix on
that goddamn Death Star.
[SPEAKER_04]: I drive me nuts, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Death Star.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give us some context.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us about the Asterix one of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's... I don't know what
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like it was... I mean...
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a cut that's very hard to trace
provenance on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the direction it came, but like for
the people who have experienced Death Star
[SPEAKER_04]: before and had it from like the Death Star
crew, it's Death Star.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely, definitely Death Star.
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, it's like the most perfect Death
Star reproduction ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, either way.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll say as well that the Asterix tells
you so much about how much these guys care
[SPEAKER_08]: about what they know or don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's, yeah, I think it's really sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I can also add that within like
the last year, it seems like everyone and
[SPEAKER_01]: their fucking moms popping out with the
Death Star.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Grandma's Death Star?
[SPEAKER_04]: It made it out of circles, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it used to be a cut that was only in
certain circles.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could only get it here in certain
circles.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's one of the few that like the real
cut made it out of those circles into
[SPEAKER_04]: places where people were selling clones on
the clone market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because of that, it's accessible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's one of the few that like,
I think is a really dank line that made it
[SPEAKER_04]: into the clone market, like the actual
cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in this case, it's a good thing or
probably would be gone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: In hearing from you all, I did actually
want to draw on one thing I think that
[SPEAKER_08]: Earn was getting into.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll do another, I want to do another
round here in this warmup, which is what
[SPEAKER_08]: did it feel like that very first time you
actually flowered something?
[SPEAKER_08]: That very first time?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because recently, right, I got this
feeling and it's totally unrelated.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Loco has been setting up new like
fish tanks for himself.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it kind of gave me that sense of like,
it reminded me of that joy when I first
[SPEAKER_08]: set up like my first like growing space.
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of wanted to hear from each of you,
like what that moment was like when you
[SPEAKER_08]: were first like actually growing,
you know, whenever you think that was.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can start with Michael again.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, Thousand, it was about 100%
fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just being super scared of getting caught.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having to go in the middle of the night to
cut the plant down and just hoping I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get pulled over on the way home with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for real.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'd like to be like, oh, it was so
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was awesome once it was dried and I was
back at home, you know, with the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the actual process was super scary.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet you taking it home would have been
freaky that time as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it was nerve wracking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, once it was in the closet
and I could actually look at it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights because I was always going at night
to water and stuff and seeing like the
[SPEAKER_00]: night nice pinks and purples on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was, I was pretty fucking stoked,
you know, and I was proud of myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like it's nice being able to do
something for yourself, especially when
[SPEAKER_04]: you're young, you know, I think I imagine
to make this whole conversation pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It right is like there's several different
generations of growers here from modern
[SPEAKER_04]: times that have only grown indoor to like
my generation and then all the way back to
[SPEAKER_04]: Michael's because he was growing well
before me, you know, all the way back.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not that old, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's just so much older, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was growing in the old days,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's the real kick in the balls is
these guys like local and panda that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been growing for like such a short amount
of time and they just hit home run after
[SPEAKER_00]: home run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you see their pictures and it's
just like, oh, what the fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what it reminds me of is like in
skateboarding, like back in the day when,
[SPEAKER_04]: when I would be skateboarding and doing
tricks, like we'd be busting like 360
[SPEAKER_04]: flips thinking we were just so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you played like the Tony Hawk game and
see all this crazy shit you can do in the
[SPEAKER_04]: game.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I go on Instagram and watch kids
doing the Tony Hawk moves real in real
[SPEAKER_04]: life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I couldn't even comprehend the gravity
physics of any of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminds me a lot of that with these
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I didn't have a quick start.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a brown thumb.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a lot of failing to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like earn even just since he's been
in our group, I've watched him progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, and like jump me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a lot in how, and how his product
turns out routinely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, that's something else,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something else to watch.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: For the record, I should say that for
myself, I've been growing only for about
[SPEAKER_08]: four years as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm in between earn and local,
um, in terms of, uh, growing experience or
[SPEAKER_08]: at least time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: What was that initial moment like for you
whenever you think that was?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can remember it like full on
like, you know, um, ordering I,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I started indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I ordered like some shitty like
Mars Hydro kit and like got like a four by
[SPEAKER_02]: four tent with like a light and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like setting all this shit up in my
basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like super excited about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I had like a whole four by four tent
for one clone to start because I just like
[SPEAKER_02]: had no other seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just so like, and I would just
like sit down there with like a chair and
[SPEAKER_02]: with my tent open and just like smoke a
joint and just like watch this fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what I was doing, but I was just so
into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like, man, like I've wanted to
do this for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, just like for whatever reasons I
haven't been able to, and now I'm able to,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm just like, it's just so cool to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I still definitely have that feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I like, like I have the like,
you know, whatever some, some plant that
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super stoked about and I'm getting
ready to flip it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, dude, I'm so fucking stoked
to just see what's going to come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it's still really fun to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Local.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so my first time like actually getting
set up growing, I mean, I was like maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: 18 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and was obviously kind of broke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I bought piece by piece,
um, throughout like the first growth
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but like it was still fun to watch it
because like it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was growing, but I had like a shitty,
uh, five bar spectra or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and a two by four tent and kind of
just, uh, went with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing great, but, uh, started learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each round after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that says something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it like, uh, a particularly scary or,
you know, exciting moment for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that was in a really like,
uh, weird, you know, uh, place in my life
[SPEAKER_01]: where I just didn't care about stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, but yeah, that's really,
that's an interesting contrast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, it's the different
generations though, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you don't have to tell us,
but I mean, as the context for this,
[SPEAKER_08]: because you weren't necessarily like,
I don't know, like it wasn't a passion
[SPEAKER_08]: when you started, is that accurate or
like, why, why were you, why were you so
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of like, I don't know, uh,
epithetic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more so that I was interested in
growing things like just plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and when you're broke, you don't want
to fucking buy a weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's the last thing you want to
spend money on, especially when eights are
[SPEAKER_01]: 45 bucks a piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, fuck that, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I wonder if Matt actually wants to
tell us about his first kind of moments.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, like I've talked about it
before, but my first, uh, moment after,
[SPEAKER_04]: after I was on my own and decided I was
going to grow by myself, um, I thought I
[SPEAKER_04]: was going to be smart and avoid paying all
this high dollar for lights, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I figured I would outsmart everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I went to, um, Walmart and got,
uh, some halogen grow lights that they
[SPEAKER_04]: called them halogen grow lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were just basically how it was in
heat lamps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tried growing a seedling from bad
seed with this halogen seed lamp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was the most painful thing when I,
when I showed my friend who was another
[SPEAKER_04]: grower at the time, that was way more
advanced than me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I showed him and I was all proud of
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, is it supposed to be like
this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like a seedling, like,
you know, a foot tall with like just a
[SPEAKER_04]: little kind of leading on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, dude, put that out of its
misery now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember so heartbroken.
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can save it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not killing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, bro, kill that please.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, so mine was not a good
experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine was a very disheartening experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was one of those times where I had
to realize just, did you think you're like
[SPEAKER_04]: smart at shit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you can't just run headfirst into
something that you know nothing about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like going from my dad's shit when I was a
kid to that was just 90 day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no place that I could outsmart
anyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was a big learning curve,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent a good month wasting time on that
bean pole.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a seedling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because I mean, it's really nice to
hear from you all about how you started,
[SPEAKER_08]: because I think, as we've already seen,
like it's very different for different
[SPEAKER_08]: people in different contexts.
[SPEAKER_08]: How we also kind of came to, how do I put
it, how we got to this indoor growing
[SPEAKER_08]: episode actually was I was actually trying
to figure out a hydro episode with Spindle
[SPEAKER_08]: here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately, we couldn't get,
we couldn't, we didn't manage to convince
[SPEAKER_08]: Bittersweet to come on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we kind of adapted this to a more
general like indoor growing episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in that time, I was starting to think
more and more about less about the tech,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, less just like isolated
conversations about tech and gear and
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff and more about, oh, I actually
wonder what people's journeys individually
[SPEAKER_08]: were like.
[SPEAKER_08]: Michael, I think you started to get to
this in your intro.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to know like, how did you get to
this system or setup that you're using
[SPEAKER_08]: now?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, how long did that take?
[SPEAKER_08]: How, you know, from a very broad,
you know, perspective.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'd like to hear from each of you
about this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like how long did it take for you to
develop your system to where it is?
[SPEAKER_08]: And what were some of the major lessons
along the way?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the beginning, it was really
hard because I would buy like high times
[SPEAKER_00]: or cannabis Canada, cannabis culture,
magazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd see the articles and I'd see the
like the metal halide lights and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was nowhere in Eugene that I
could find that stuff for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me and my buddies would have to drive
all the way to Portland just to find a
[SPEAKER_00]: store that actually sold the lighting
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I wish, I wish those tents
would have came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know when people started buying
the grow tents or they started being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, I wish those would have been
around, you know, when I was younger,
[SPEAKER_00]: because those things are just super
convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the system, my first closet grow
was in just soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I kept doing, you know,
after that first successful one,
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept doing research and I'd see articles
and one of my buddies approached me with
[SPEAKER_00]: setting up his garage to do like a
nutrient film technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just bought a bunch of gutters from
Home Depot and we'd let the water pass
[SPEAKER_00]: through and the plant sat in the gutters
raised up on like hydroton little baskets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we had a good run in the
winter and then the summer of the run just
[SPEAKER_00]: completely turned to shit because at the
time I didn't understand, but it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat of the water, like once the garage
started heating up, the water temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: started heating up, we started getting
bacteria everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we didn't have anyone to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, there was, there was no YouTube
to look up videos on how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really it took me a good five or six
years to even figure out why that run
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, so I had tried the
nutrient film technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried ebb and flow once I moved to
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one seemed real simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I saw somebody on the old forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, I think it was Ivan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what he went by.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Jack Mayhoffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I saw him do like a post with,
he was using cocoa, I think, but it was
[SPEAKER_00]: drained to waste.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I saw the drain to waste,
it just all clicked to me because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh my God, that is so much easier
and so much more precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can just use, you know, a little
condensate pump to get rid of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff, you know, and there's not going to
be any mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once I saw those posts and I wanted
to try it myself, I knew I before doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it, I knew it was going to be the easiest
way for me, you know, and now that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: older, I, you know, I'd love to be an
organic gardener, but I simply don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the time, you know, with working as much
as I do and the amount of work it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to have any failed runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting older.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure every run that I do,
I get to see the potential of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not the, you know, a hundred
percent greatest organic knock it out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the park, but it's always good with the
system that I run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's easy to dial in.
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you've kept this current system for how
long would you say, at least like,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, loosely?
[SPEAKER_00]: Drained waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty, I'm a little bit ignorant
about nutrient film.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, could you give us a, like a very,
like, you know, a high level?
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine, have you ever seen an arrow
cloner?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant basically is suspended above
where the water passes through and the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots just hang down and we use,
you can use PVC pipes or gutters or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a constant flow of water with
nutrients in it is always bathing the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, but it never stands still.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the water's always moving all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little different than, like,
let's say, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one where the water culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different than that where in,
in that system, the water sits pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: stable in one spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you aerate that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, the water's always moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always passing through.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is also why when it gets heated and
a little bit warmer, but all the water
[SPEAKER_04]: stays warm and it gets really super
aerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely, it's, it's super
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to, you'd have to spend the
money and really be on your game to have
[SPEAKER_00]: like a large scale nutrient film technique
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some dudes had it down, but yeah,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took chillers and all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of expenses and one problem
overnight and your plants would be dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if a pump went out or something or
your chiller went out, you could be pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much finished in 24 hours.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, I grow in Rockwell now for the
drain to waste because I can get away with
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something breaks and I don't see it for
12 or 14 hours, the plants are still fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've, I've gone more than 24
hours without watering in Rockwell before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still been able to pick up and just
go, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's, it's very flexible.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did have a general question for you
about, you know, the very broad field of
[SPEAKER_08]: hydro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you say that over the last few
years, one technique has kind of emerged
[SPEAKER_08]: as the most popular or favorite.
[SPEAKER_08]: And is it this one is what Biggeron would
call the meta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, drain to waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're doing anything on scale,
which I'm not, but if you were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like one of the big facilities,
I'm pretty sure of 90, 95% of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: running drain to waste.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: So over time people have converged like
towards this, this approach.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say for the deep water culture,
that seems like mainly a small home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Situation where someone wants to go two or
three huge plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I rarely see anybody stick with DWC for
like a whole career of growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's usually like a, a path someone takes
for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there are people who have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just so rare to see someone be like a
hardcore RDWC dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a lot of extra work.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's, I actually, I did that for
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_08]: You go and you tell us about, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us about what you learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I mean, I started with soil,
just like happy frog or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like from the hydro shop and got
some like the general hydro one part
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a flora Nova and like a,
wait, sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just ask you here?
[SPEAKER_08]: Were you watching Mr. Fuck Mr. Canuck
grows?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched Mr. Canuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: His fucking editing is next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as far as like cool, Mr. Canuck,
he, so he's just his like, he has really
[SPEAKER_02]: good editing, nice cameras.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out Mr. Canuck, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not going to trash this anyways,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I, yes, I was watching stuff like
that and was, um, I went to the hydroponic
[SPEAKER_02]: store, talked to this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sells me a bunch of shit that I don't
need basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go home and just, you know,
grow some shitty plants for a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then I got really, at some point,
I don't know why, but I got really
[SPEAKER_02]: obsessed with like the fact with like soil
that like, I couldn't control like,
[SPEAKER_02]: like if there was some kind of nutrient,
excess or, you know, or whatever it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just couldn't control it quickly enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like, I got obsessed with this
feeling of like needing to be able to like
[SPEAKER_02]: really monitor each of those parameters
with like pH and stuff, which is what led
[SPEAKER_02]: me into DWC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went to DWC and, um, you know,
I'm not growing at scale either,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I am doing like a perpetual kind of
deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I had, I had this one run where
like a lot, I'm going to echo a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: same stuff Spindle said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I had this one, I had this one run
where I was growing autos at this point
[SPEAKER_02]: in, uh, DWC, which like, whoo,
dude, crush me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, they, uh, they were looking great
one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like great, like the best plants
I've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next day they're like
drooping and brown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, what is going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I'm like trying to save
these plants and I couldn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like they died, like, like three plants
died.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, that was like my first real
failure where I was like, I couldn't,
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't get anything from the group.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and was like mid flower, you know,
and I'd put a lot of time into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, man, that's sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started reading into it and stuff,
checking my water temperature really
[SPEAKER_02]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran into the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water temperature starts getting up.
[SPEAKER_02]: To like 72, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to be like 65.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I'm like, I'm looking at like
water chillers and I'm like, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have, I'm running like a four
by four and a two by four, and I'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: to buy a water chiller for each camp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's $700 in water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, no, I'm not doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so that was the end of my deep water
culture career.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did like a couple of runs in it and it
really taught me a ton about just like
[SPEAKER_02]: managing pH or managing.
[SPEAKER_02]: BPM and stuff like that, but it was just
too expensive for what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also wanted to be able to hunt like,
you know, a good population size.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was tough for me to do in deep
water culture as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, you also, there's a lot of
things you also, if it's recirculating,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you, you know, there's, you have like
all the plants are feeding from the same
[SPEAKER_02]: reservoir.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then like you are, it's, I mean,
that's not accurate, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not controlling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what each is getting and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I ended up coming back into soil
and tried to do the organic kind of deal
[SPEAKER_02]: for a little bit, which realistically was
me using organic nutrients and doing drain
[SPEAKER_02]: to waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so I wouldn't necessarily
even say like, I'm not going to sit here
[SPEAKER_02]: and tell you I'm an organic, you know,
I, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That I have any real good base for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that led me up into where just doing
drain to waste cocoa with Canna nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went down to just baseline Canna A
and B, grew plants for a few runs with
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then now I'm adding stuff in to just
like, see how it affects stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was adding like silica and all
this, all these different like additives
[SPEAKER_02]: and just not really having like an
understanding of like why I was doing it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's come back to silica later.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I think it's one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: So your current approach and how long have
you been doing that?
[SPEAKER_08]: You say it's pretty stable now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, basically I've been doing the same
stuff for, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've ran through, I'm on my second bottle
of Canna now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how long that takes, you know,
I mean, not that long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've only been growing for two
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just feel like I've done,
I did a bunch of approaches like really
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly because I just wanted to see it
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And now have settled on the drain to waste
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Remind me to come back to like additives
later.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we'll have a nutrients kind of
recap later, but yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Local.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us about your, you know, current
system, how you got there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now I'm running, um, cocoa drain
to waste, um, using, uh, Canna,
[SPEAKER_01]: A and B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've been rocking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just say one thing before we get any
further.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I know three of us use Canna.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are not sponsored affiliated.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not marketing for Canna just happens
that, you know, we'd like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're all good, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I've been rocking that for about,
um, well, not Canna for two years,
[SPEAKER_01]: three, well, three years now, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I've been doing a cocoa drain to
waste for three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I kind of got into that cause I
was, you know, doing organic, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: air quote organic grows indoor and wanted
a little more control, more, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, space to pop seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so cocoa was my best option.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any like in terms of like what you
experienced, like, did you go have to go
[SPEAKER_08]: through any like, I don't know,
big failures or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my first one, um, which was
overfeeding some plants, not all plants
[SPEAKER_01]: responded negatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, cause I was, um, my first run,
of cocoa was using Jack's three,
[SPEAKER_01]: two, one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it was a little high in N for some
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, you know, some things weren't the
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other things were pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I switched over to something that
was, um, you know, a little less,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, high in nitrogen, um, or at least had,
you know, calcium heavily associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I don't think it's a good source for
every variety per se for calcium,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, when you use Jack's, do they still
have, like, have a, is it a bright blue
[SPEAKER_00]: color still?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I remember one solution being blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember which one, but it was
like blue and then kind of like a brownish
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I always went back in the day,
the first time I ever tried Jack's,
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember being like this super bright
blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, why do they add dye to
their nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's so weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a plant can't want dye, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's just like the raw form.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the form that it comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's weird, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: No clue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, while y'all were talking, I did kind
of have some thoughts around some of the
[SPEAKER_08]: trade-offs between like the various
styles.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for me, one of the things that seems
to be common between, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: quote unquote organic, um, and quote
unquote hydro is there's some degree of
[SPEAKER_08]: finessing and troubleshooting before you
arrive at like a stable approach.
[SPEAKER_08]: Would y'all agree with that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it feels to me like for both of
them, once you've kind of dialed it in
[SPEAKER_08]: enough, you can kind of take it for
granted at that point and kind of run with
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the interesting thing for me,
as someone who is still like, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: Pete based potting mix is that,
um, you know, one of the trade-offs there
[SPEAKER_08]: is that I don't have to do as much kind of
fine tuning.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of buffered and like kept safe,
you know, in certain ways from things,
[SPEAKER_08]: but I may not at the same time achieve
like, say quite the same degree of like
[SPEAKER_08]: stability as like a hydro grow or,
you know, something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are your thoughts on some of these
things?
[SPEAKER_08]: I imagine, I imagine some of you have
factored these things in, like what the
[SPEAKER_08]: risks are, you know, set up costs,
uh, stability, you know, those kinds of
[SPEAKER_08]: trade-offs kind of open to the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of riffing a bit, you know,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Local please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just going to say, um,
you know, one of the big, uh, drivers for
[SPEAKER_01]: me switching to Coco is, um, I wanted to
have, you know, it's a growth of a hydro
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, but not have to invest in an
entire, you know, hydro type setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Coco, you know, I can hand water it and
get really, really good results and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, really fast growth in a tiny
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought it was a really cheap
approach to having a semi-productive
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes I think, uh,
one of the things with like, you can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: organic in peat, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's more of a soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thousand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, um, what's nice about growing
that way is you have, uh, like a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you, you, it's, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a lot of work to come out with,
um, a really like a good product.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you'd have to really fuck
something up to grow garbage that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whereas like, if you take a
hydro system, um, a couple of mistakes or
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of misunderstandings about
certain things, you can grow some really
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty weed, you know, fragile.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's one of the benefits of
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I also think it's a lot harder to hit
this, uh, like a really high ceiling with
[SPEAKER_00]: organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you need to really, really be good
and be on your game, have an understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: of what you're feeding and when,
and when those nutrients are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I think is a lot easier to hit,
um, in hydro, you know, I like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and I consider what local does
hydro as well, even if it's not a system,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because he's controlling what
the plants are feeding and what's
[SPEAKER_00]: available to them all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, going back to like the ebb
and flow and the deep water culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I didn't like about those systems is
that number one, you have to completely
[SPEAKER_00]: empty, um, the reservoir, like dump it all
out and then change it every week because
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant as it's getting watered,
especially if the water is recirculating
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time, it's going to pull what it
wants out right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early in the week, it's getting
everything it wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas as the week progresses,
those nutrients are going to be less and
[SPEAKER_00]: less available to the plant because it's
already drank them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that also does is that alters the
pH of what's available to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're having to stay on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the way, uh, I think all three of
us are doing it now, we always know the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants pH is the same wherever we want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always getting a constant supply
of the nutrients, um, that it wants and
[SPEAKER_00]: has available to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, so you're not having to
worry about certain things getting low
[SPEAKER_00]: when we don't have the big systems that
are monitoring what's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of the plant after water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's kind of like when I had
that kind of experience in DWC where you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: get into Lake flower and then the plants
would just not really be eating and they'd
[SPEAKER_02]: just be drinking more than they're eating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden you check your
reservoir and your pH is like went from
[SPEAKER_02]: 6.2 to like 5.5 overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like your VC just shot shot up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you're like trying to like do this
math in your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how the fuck do I, how much water do
I add back in to cut this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, it's just a lot of
variables and there's been a lot of these
[SPEAKER_02]: times where I'd be in my basement,
just fucking dumping water everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just fucking getting rid of those
reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, it's a lot of work,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're just in your basement,
like dumping buckets of water,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a lot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're lucky enough to have a drain in
your basement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a, I have a, I have a soap pump
down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just think about that in California
where there aren't many basements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when you're talking like sometimes
you know, if you have, say you have four
[SPEAKER_02]: plants with a reservoir, that's like damn
near 20 gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of water, a lot of nutrients,
a lot of everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's, it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are all these different ways of
evaluating these different grow
[SPEAKER_08]: approaches.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I really like what's Mendel said
about basically, I think he was unpacking
[SPEAKER_08]: what consistency means in a way,
like having a higher floor, but maybe like
[SPEAKER_08]: a lower ceiling is, is like more
consistency and that's a trade-off,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: But then you have different kinds of
trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, like I was saying with hydro or
soilless, you get the system for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The trade-off is that the labor is not
necessarily during the run when you have
[SPEAKER_08]: fine tuned everything, but it is the
process of actually fine tuning it all to
[SPEAKER_08]: begin with and getting it stable to begin
with.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where the labor goes for organic.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, it's similar in the sense that like
your ability to prepare your soil,
[SPEAKER_08]: troubleshoot it, test it.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of that is upfront labor that once you
want, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you've kind of gone through that,
then your grows are like, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: easier, but you have to do all that labor
upfront.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if you're in like a, you know,
your hand watering and your, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: potting mix or whatever, like me,
the labor is constant, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about hand watering and keeping an
eye on things and tailoring stuff to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the last, sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: You go, you go in.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's, I was just going to add that
that's kind of the thing that I like about
[SPEAKER_02]: drain to waste is that it just allows me
to not think about the nutrients anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: To a certain degree, I get to a point
where I can just mix my stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what my water's coming out,
whatever, you know, I mix it, I feed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm able to just focus on a lot
of other things, like just good watering
[SPEAKER_02]: practices and like making sure your
environment's like in a good place and
[SPEAKER_02]: like making sure that your plants are
looking good, you know, just things like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's just like much
more important than focusing on any
[SPEAKER_02]: certain nutrient line in itself,
you know, to a degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I definitely want to make that point
too, because like, I've grown good,
[SPEAKER_02]: what I think is good weed with general
hydro, with fruits organic, with like
[SPEAKER_02]: other, you know, tons of brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, it's just more about like,
uh, paying attention to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I think like good watering
practices and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll definitely come back to that about
you go, Michael.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to reiterate that I'm not
saying that organic has a low ceiling
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm saying like a really good
organic garden has a really high ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's, it's a lot, um,
easier to get to a somewhat high ceiling
[SPEAKER_00]: in hydroponics than it is in organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes, in my opinion, it takes some
real skill to hit that high ceiling,
[SPEAKER_00]: but organic gardeners that do their
products, absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I should.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely not trying to imply that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I, when I say like, uh, higher floor,
lower ceiling, I do mean that very broadly
[SPEAKER_08]: and like that's still me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to offend anybody because
people get super fucking pissed off and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen organic.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a reason why we have five people
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they if we get, if we get in trouble,
there are five targets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we didn't gang up and take them out,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Five times one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that too.
[SPEAKER_08]: That too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, well, I think the last, the last thing
I think for me that emerged from our
[SPEAKER_08]: conversation as well is like the different
forms of like risk mitigation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for example, like, again, like Michael
was saying, if something goes wrong for me
[SPEAKER_08]: in like a peat based potting mix,
um, there's usually time.
[SPEAKER_08]: For me to resolve that, or is something
going wrong?
[SPEAKER_08]: I imagine in like, uh, DWC set up,
like Erin was saying, it happens very,
[SPEAKER_08]: very fast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and your recovery window, your time,
your window in which to recover is like
[SPEAKER_08]: much smaller, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is the reason again,
this is the real reason I think why I
[SPEAKER_08]: wanted a bunch of us on this, because we
could actually talk through some of these
[SPEAKER_08]: like nuances.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas, you know, you get those like
click baiting videos that are like,
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hydro versus Pete or like organic
versus synthetic outside of like any
[SPEAKER_08]: context and like bad information.
I think.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think like any style, if you just take
the time to learn it and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to grow good wheat,
you know, you just have to be willing to
[SPEAKER_02]: learn how to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ultimately the end goal there,
you know, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: About the nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to learn about like how to grow
plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like, you just have to mentally
prepare yourself for someone in the
[SPEAKER_08]: comments to be like, so what's the best
approach?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's no best approach though.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: The best approach is what works for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I'm also like a big thing
about like getting seeds, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like all everybody, like when I came into
growing, I saw all these websites selling
[SPEAKER_02]: clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had no idea what that was about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, I'm just some random
dude that like wanted to try to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I get online and I see there's I
can buy a cut of literally you name it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like they're a thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so I just really think that
people should get seeds and find plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that grow good in their environment and
what they're set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the way that you will find it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're definitely approaching that
that broad topic of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: what makes for a good girl.
[SPEAKER_08]: But before then, I didn't want to kind of
I think who was I talking to about this?
[SPEAKER_08]: Must be an oriental local.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were talking about uncertainty around
popular additives.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought there'd be an interesting little
segue into that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we were talking about silica.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: As one of the additives that is very
popular and commonly prescribed,
[SPEAKER_08]: but also like not not really knowing with
any certainty, like whether those things
[SPEAKER_08]: actually make a difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of curious for like y'all to go
around and think about, like, I don't
[SPEAKER_08]: know, have there been additives that
you've used that you're like, I don't know
[SPEAKER_08]: if this is just superstition or like,
I don't know if this is just like dogma or
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, silica is the bad one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big one for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the conversation we were having
was about how I'm I'm always trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: just figure out better ways to like when
to water my plants and like when to like
[SPEAKER_02]: how like, I don't know, like, I don't
really necessarily want to mix every
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient that I'm going to use into a rez
and just like feed it all in one go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I'll just break it up a little
bit, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had mixed some silica in with my
canna just to see what it would do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it precipitated like pretty bad
because silica like drives the pH up like
[SPEAKER_02]: insane and like all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just that's one for me that like I have
done it with and without side by side on
[SPEAKER_02]: the same exact plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't tell the difference
personally.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember we were talking to Farma Dan as
well, and he was saying that he did think
[SPEAKER_08]: there was a difference in I think he said
it was like stem thickness or something
[SPEAKER_08]: that he could tell or yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone else?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna kick all your asses in the
silica conversation right about now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which kind of silica were you using?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so I yeah, so I've used like a couple
different kinds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, like the dry potassium silica.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so that's that's one thing that I
think like, hey, you guys know me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am still on this block when it comes to
organic to nutrients like it just never
[SPEAKER_04]: been an interest of mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one thing I have learned is that
potassium silicate is something great in
[SPEAKER_04]: gardens if you're like reusing your soil,
especially because in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: it takes so long for it to be consumed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's unless you're reusing your soil
and reusing your medium, throwing silica
[SPEAKER_04]: in in potassium silicate form isn't going
to do much.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is, you know, stuff like
PowerSI.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, not sponsored here by anyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: But PowerSI, which is a once I've used and
I was going to say I've used that one as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was doing the deep water,
I was using that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's my favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't use it the way everybody else
does, because the way I found it works
[SPEAKER_04]: best for me was adjusting nitrogen
deficiencies and like calcium magnesium
[SPEAKER_04]: deficiencies on the fly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever I used it, I would use it in
concert with other nutrients to make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would almost be like mainlining it to
the plant, like watching watching it
[SPEAKER_04]: change before my eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like within a few hours, I would see major
changes in how quickly it would uptake
[SPEAKER_04]: other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as what the monosilicic acid,
which is what PowerSI is doing itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, of course, it's going to increase
the stem strength and structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what silica does.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a more effective, readily
available silica.
[SPEAKER_04]: But how it helps carry other nutrients is
super, super interesting to watch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's been my favorite thing for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I screw up my plants,
it helps me adjust it on the fly and get
[SPEAKER_04]: it back to peak health instantly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you always notice it too, because your
plants will immediately just go,
what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Pray straight up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite good for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I use as a PH up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: The PowerSI?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, monosilicic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: PowerSI I only use as a foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my reservoir is sterile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say that there's no benefit for
silica, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that for me personally,
I've focused more on uping calcium and
[SPEAKER_02]: just good watering practices, honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say that all the time, but no shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just waiting for the pot to be light and
then watering it then and learning what
[SPEAKER_02]: your pots feel like when they're light and
stuff like that has probably been the
[SPEAKER_02]: biggest thing that has made my plants look
healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get on Reddit right now and you
look at all the beginner posts about my
[SPEAKER_02]: plants look like shit, I bet 90% of them
are just overwatered.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not realizing about pH fluctuations
and thinking it's the wrong kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I using the wrong kind of nutrients?
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times it's just not even reaching
the plants and just not uptaking the
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrients at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we can do a little segue here and
talk about troubleshooting because I think
[SPEAKER_08]: that as a kind of process as well,
because I think that sort of to me,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's kind of interesting as someone who's
still pretty new.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you see something going wrong,
where does your brain first go and what
[SPEAKER_08]: are the kind of successive stages?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Ern said, for me, initially,
I always did assume it was watering
[SPEAKER_08]: because for whatever reason for the first
couple of years, there was a high thing to
[SPEAKER_08]: figure out or I don't know why,
like the dry wet cycle thing was just
[SPEAKER_08]: like, I don't know why it was still
confusing to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm kind of curious to know whether y
'all have any kind of sequence of
[SPEAKER_08]: parameters to look through when you're
troubleshooting a problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe start with local.
[SPEAKER_08]: Local has been real quiet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Has it passed out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't even know what additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local's using and I want to know that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess in terms of additives,
the way I kind of see additives is if all
[SPEAKER_01]: your essentials are in check, then like
additives are really cool, but it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes it might be best to adjust your
main feed and then consider additives
[SPEAKER_01]: after the fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Ern was kind of mentioning
that and his working with Kana,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but I think that's kind of the
way I see additives is using them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever seen any real benefits from
any particular additive local?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it depends what you're trying like
to achieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it's an actual like deficiency,
maybe like, or maybe you want to add a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more extra like, I don't know,
calcium, like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: PCAL is pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's helped me a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use it every watering maybe like
once every other week or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: But can you tell us a bit more about that
one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium phosphate I think is like the is
the chemical nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has a good amount of calcium and a
good amount of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice additive for like flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I really like it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like lack calcium by any means,
but like it doesn't hurt to add a little
[SPEAKER_01]: extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also find that under LEDs, your plants
will definitely benefit from calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, or other additives just because
they're metabolizing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a little faster or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's kind of my take on
additives.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you played with anything else that's
been interesting, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really all I use is Kana AB,
maybe some like some of their PK,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I really don't ever use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It I kind of just add like a little bit of
PCAL every, you know, two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes I'll do one of the
nectar of the gods bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like that's just like sugars really
for the bacteria that I inoculate my my
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it sounds kind of intuitive,
but like it still it still does something,
[SPEAKER_01]: I assume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're establishing a beneficial
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: My EC isn't too extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's it's nothing exaggerated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I still use my go all through my
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use my go when I'm transplanting and all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put it directly on, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys notice a difference from not
using it to when you do use it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do kind of like I like to use it
like especially like a transplant with my
[SPEAKER_02]: clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll inoculate the roots then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, man, like it could just
be like it's like evaluating the roots is
[SPEAKER_02]: like hard sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're like all looking pretty
healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like but it does seem like they form
just like more thicker roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it just helped like my kind of
thing that I'm thinking about is like if
[SPEAKER_02]: there's waste material in the soil and
stuff like that and the bacteria are just
[SPEAKER_02]: like kind of like like they're able to
help with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm growing in small pots as well,
like local.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, anything I can get to help is
good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do want to say for the record that there
are a number of things I use that I've
[SPEAKER_08]: never systematically verified as like
being beneficial, but I still use every
[SPEAKER_08]: every rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, for example, like 17 bottles of
advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you didn't necessarily know what what
they're all doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No fucking clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the formulas are 10 times better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that was the thing that I think
like additives that have like I've really
[SPEAKER_02]: noticed all for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I did was when I switched to
Kanna, I switched over to Cocoa and all I
[SPEAKER_02]: grew with was Kanna A and B.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no other additives, nothing for the
entire from start to finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I added back in the calcium
phosphate that locals talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I noticed like the transition like
from like when they start to stretch,
[SPEAKER_02]: when they like start to slow down on
stretching into flour, I was I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they just looked a lot healthier around
that time period for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like the whole stretching period using
the calcium phosphate, the calcium
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphate seems the plants just look
healthier comparatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local, is there a particular brand of
calcium phosphate that you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just I guess any that you can find at your
like garden center.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not I'm not a build a soil guy,
but build a soil sells calcium phosphate
[SPEAKER_02]: really cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Twenty five pound bag for like 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like a teaspoon per gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it lasts forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like the thing is, is like it has to
be watered in solution, if that makes
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the particulate has to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so you have to use like saponin or
some kind of other like something to hold
[SPEAKER_02]: the calcium in solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the actual rock particles,
because it's rock phosphate, it like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: derived from rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't dissolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it doesn't, sadly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I use I use the sap, the sap like
saponin from I get it from Crybaby and
[SPEAKER_02]: just mix it with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like it holds it in suspension
pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also alternatively have top dressed with
it before and just watered it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've used it before, like at
transplant, like I put it in my root zone
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like throw a little teaspoon,
you know, sprinkle some that helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Them adjust as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, anything else on any other like
notable or interesting additives?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're completely unnecessary,
but that's just power SI and maybe a full
[SPEAKER_00]: year of calcium or kelp like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would kind of maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, I think the nutrient
companies are so on point at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The additives are really they're
unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of them are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love power SI because it helps
with the stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I pull your feed power SI every
three days during the first 20 days of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, my plants won't elongate too much
and I can keep the canopy a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: even.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about all I have for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a moment when Matt left and I
thought he would, you know, Matt's
[SPEAKER_08]: actually kind of confessed to me in
private that like growing conversations
[SPEAKER_08]: bore him.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thought he was going to do that,
like I'm going to go to the corner store
[SPEAKER_08]: for some milk and then just not not
return.
[SPEAKER_08]: But he's not still here.
[SPEAKER_04]: What actually happened is, you know,
I've been using this proxy today and it
[SPEAKER_04]: ran out of steam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Already, just by starting this episode,
it's already dead of batteries from a
[SPEAKER_04]: whole battery.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was pissed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to go get the other thing that I
use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Live review.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, live review.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like, really, it's already dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't smoke that much, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, well, I did want to move on to again,
I think quite a philosophical topic,
[SPEAKER_08]: which was troubleshooting.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Erin kind of gestured towards it
before.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just curious, like, do you all have
any general thoughts on like your
[SPEAKER_08]: troubleshooting process or advice for the
noobs who are like, you know, trying to
[SPEAKER_08]: figure out what's going on with their
plant?
[SPEAKER_08]: Plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say generally the answer, if you're if
you're just learning, the answer is
[SPEAKER_00]: generally not going to be more fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's most likely going to be less water
and less intense lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can't trust everything you
hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the LED companies, they're
constantly pushing, you know, these lights
[SPEAKER_00]: at 12 inches give you 1400 PPFD or
whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really asking for trouble with that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get away with 600, 700 PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just watering your plants less and
making sure the environment itself is
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, humidity and temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to do a lot more for a
beginner grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then trying to really blast your plants,
you don't have to grow like the jungle
[SPEAKER_00]: boys, you know, like that's you don't,
you know, those guys, they have perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get away with just taking it slow
and easy and having beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I would have if I could like tell
myself like, you know, starting out again,
[SPEAKER_02]: like what to do, I would go straight to
like a two part drained away system and I
[SPEAKER_02]: would learn it like the back of my hand
and I would dial my environment in and I
[SPEAKER_02]: would, you know, it's so it like like what
Spindle was saying earlier, how he was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, well, maybe it's not like maybe it's
not the best as like some, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: rings out and Mendo with like the best
soil in the world growing the best weed
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know, all this stuff, but it's
like, maybe the ceiling isn't that high,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's better than anything I can
get around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, I mean, for me, that's,
you know, that's the goal here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're actually getting pretty close to
like, yeah, what makes for a good grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm still like really excited for that
part of the combo, but local thoughts on
[SPEAKER_08]: like, troubleshooting slash, you know,
what advice would you give to people?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how frequently are you watering
your plants is a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest, like a handful of my
problems, maybe within the last three
[SPEAKER_01]: years, if they're even problems,
I guess they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, I acknowledge that me not,
you know, watering them one night,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, gets my plant a little pissed
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But God damn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that thing where I forget what we
were talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were talking about troubleshooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, advice for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you know, keep on schedule with your
watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Spindle said, don't overfeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make sure you're environment isn't
too extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you don't want it to extreme in
humidity or you don't want it to extreme
[SPEAKER_01]: and heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you just got to learn how to
adjust your parameters to get your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, I'm not really too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'll do it like for the sake of
getting my plants happy, but I'm not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to monitor and, you know, have like graphs
and shit display my VPD, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, just that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think what you and Spindle both have
implied as well is sometimes there's not
[SPEAKER_08]: just one parameter in isolation that's
wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually like an interaction between
multiple parameters.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're blasting the plants with
light and you're not feeding enough,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, there are two approaches to
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can up the feed or you can lower the
lights or you can do both.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they do all interact, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a complex system.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the difficulties with
troubleshooting is that you may see
[SPEAKER_08]: symptoms and assume that the symptoms tell
you one thing, but actually these are
[SPEAKER_08]: downstream consequences of like something
else happening further upstream,
[SPEAKER_08]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the other thing I would mention in this
is also if you're making changes to not
[SPEAKER_08]: make more than I would say one change at a
time, ideally, if you can afford,
[SPEAKER_08]: if you can afford not to gamble.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you start changing multiple
variables or parameters at once,
[SPEAKER_08]: you're not really going to know what's
doing what.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for me, when I was starting out
getting to these like manic flurries,
[SPEAKER_08]: trying to fix things, you know,
I tried to change like two or three things
[SPEAKER_08]: at a time and then not know what was
actually working or not working.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think like something that I do now,
like in my own practice, like for the
[SPEAKER_02]: troubleshoot, the first thing I will do is
like if I see a plant that just looks bad,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just water it with just nice,
clean, just, you know, pH water,
[SPEAKER_02]: just like nothing in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just see how the plant responds in
that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also, you know, before I've like just
literally watered plants until they will
[SPEAKER_02]: fade, I just like have taken the nutrients
away and veg to just see what it does and
[SPEAKER_02]: how long it takes for it to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't, it's not like you're,
if you don't feed your plants one time,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not going to die.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they can make it one time without it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just think that like the
propensity of new growers to like overfeed
[SPEAKER_02]: is so, it's so easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even me, like I got the nectar for
the gods stuff to just kind of mess around
[SPEAKER_02]: with and just going off of like what they
recommend, had my plants like super curled
[SPEAKER_02]: up, like on nitrogen and stuff,
you know, like it just takes time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to learn where your nutrients are
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not going to be a substitute.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a cure all answer,
you know, you got to just kind of go
[SPEAKER_02]: through it and learn them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think there is definitely a culture
of more is better.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to work, we're definitely
going to unpack that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe just to take a break, maybe from
some of the like strategy and tech and
[SPEAKER_08]: philosophy stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't want to ask y'all what your
favorite things to run ever have been just
[SPEAKER_08]: so that we can like, yeah, have a little,
a little shift of tone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we start with local this time,
local, like, can you tell us what your
[SPEAKER_08]: favorite things ever have been to run?
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite thing ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty obvious one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say as of now, it's the sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can pick two or three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one I've had for like three years
now, I popped it from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's really, tell us a bit more
about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it's lineage and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, bittersweet SD, one of our homies
made that using two P91 S1 selections from
[SPEAKER_01]: packs that he got from Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result of those two parents
crossing, he made the sweet pea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's a really fun cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw some really cool things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, really potent, nice smells,
nice taste, nice bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like it kind of checks all the
boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I know everybody says that,
but like, man, this, this stuff is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of wish the P91 got a little more
hype than it has now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, just simply based off of the
stuff that I've seen from the crosses
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it's put out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Michael, you know, instead of,
instead of me saying a particular plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, can I go off like my favorite run that
I've ever had?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, when I first got the Bubba Kush in
2001, I set up a room, uh, to do ebb and
[SPEAKER_00]: flow and I'd never tried it before,
but I thought, you know, I've,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read enough about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a bathroom right next to this
bedroom and I'm going to go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I have very little understanding
about, you know, how many times to water
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, uh, I was growing in hydroton and I
misunderstood the watering schedule for
[SPEAKER_00]: ebb and flows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I was doing was I was just
flooding the table one time every 12 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, the strange thing about this is
that by under watering that Bubba Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to get that thing so big that
it grew next to the OGs, the same height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that extra stress just really
brought something out of the Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, on top of that, I, at some point I
started getting fungus gnats in one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tables and I'd boughten this stuff called
natural and, uh, mid-flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was using probably twice as much
as I was supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reservoir when it would pump in
would almost look like a melted chocolate
[SPEAKER_00]: milkshake and just smelled God awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some reason, that batch of Bubba
Kush came out with just beautiful,
[SPEAKER_00]: huge nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually out yielded and outsized the
OG Kush that was in the other table and it
[SPEAKER_00]: had the most beautiful lime flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful neon green color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I would say it was one of my most
uneducated and probably it potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: could have been my worst run ever,
but the stars aligned and it just turned
[SPEAKER_00]: out to be like my most fantastic favorite
run of Kush.
[SPEAKER_08]: So were there like lasting lessons from
that for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not really.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just like a weird one off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because the OG came out pretty
shitty on the next side of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew it couldn't handle that kind of
dry back, but I learned with the Bubba,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I really wanted that thing to move and
move fast and not take three months to
[SPEAKER_00]: veg, I needed to really put some,
some, some dry stress into that plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just made it into something
magical.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it definitely is a fascinating
topic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, the different individual plants and
the different, uh, tendencies and needs,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that I put in the table with,
uh, like the shoot super short Afghans,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, like Bubba or let's say, um,
Matt's berries, like the right berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's really hard not to overwater them
next to my other, uh, more OG leaning
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really have to pick out what's
going to be running on that reservoir if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all getting the same feed at the
same times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that was definitely a huge
lesson.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big learning curve going to full
Afghans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, Aaron, favorite plants or runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, um, kind of like the two plants
that I've kept the longest now at this
[SPEAKER_02]: point have been, uh, LA times bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and then I have, uh, bored again from
crybaby that I've kept.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's born again is the first time that
I ever had to penalty.
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, a diesel cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was born again is, um, it's the white
lodge cut of clockwork orange to the
[SPEAKER_02]: cheese, sour lemon tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, uh, it's kind of,
I think it's like a little bit of a,
[SPEAKER_02]: like in talking to crybaby, it was like
supposed to be like a little bit of a joke
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's like a little haze like,
uh, like the way it grows and stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and anyways, it does, it's a super
vigorous plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I ran it, it was,
uh, well, I flew to New York for the
[SPEAKER_02]: weekend and came back and it was like
touching my light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some of it was like above my light,
you know, just like very, very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very vigorous plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, first her penalty for me,
which was like, I mean, dude, like I loved
[SPEAKER_02]: her penalty now, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, that's like a really cool,
I really liked that smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, and then the LA,
what's up to penalty syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: To penalty is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems so far, it seems like it makes
everything better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I don't know, but then the LA times
bubble gum that I have is, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty racy and just like a short
finishing point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like the first plant from like
a legit reader that I grew like CSI,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: CSI is like, yeah, he would like,
there was like runs where I just ran seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: of stuff that I didn't care about because
I was scared I'd kill them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the first run that I popped.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like, I'm not going to kill these
plants for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, has anyone here actually ever come
close to, oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: You may have already mentioned some of
this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what's the worst state your plants
have ever been in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've killed a crop.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how bad do you want to get,
bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I remember when I first learned about
micronized sulfur and spraying wetable
[SPEAKER_04]: sulfur, um, someone else has given me like
totally different ideas on how to treat PM
[SPEAKER_04]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to use Nukem, not so need to use
Nukem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, everybody else is saying
to use this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, screw it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just mix them and use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you mix, uh, oils and sulfur,
what happens is it just melts your goddamn
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just absolutely totaled my whole flower
run.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the second I did it and I was like,
oh man, after that I learned that like I
[SPEAKER_04]: should have already known that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was an idiot for doing it,
but I never burned sulfur.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never had to deal with any of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great for PM dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a game changer going from having to
use like harsh harsh chemicals the few
[SPEAKER_04]: times that I had had it like in San Diego
and everybody would just you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: they blast to the hard cans and that stuff
like you even being around it and smelling
[SPEAKER_04]: it, you know that that's not going to do
you any good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to say the brand name or any
of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to get sued.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're like, yeah, it's probably cancerous
and crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So knowing that there are other options
that are safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, when people think of sulfur,
if you've only burned sulfur, and this was
[SPEAKER_04]: a big reason I didn't want to use it the
first place is because you think,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh my gosh, it's like rotten egg.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like this is an indoor indoor
where I live.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like maybe I don't want it to smell like
that, but it smells like wet beach sand
[SPEAKER_04]: when you spray it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a really pleasant smell to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the plants actually like it a lot
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the PM usually come in off of the
cutting that you you bring into your room?
[SPEAKER_04]: It can come off cuttings depending on
where you live.
[SPEAKER_04]: PM can be like you have a whole bunch of
plants around you and it's just thriving
[SPEAKER_04]: in your area coming under close.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I like to be naked and everyone
's program that I go into.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just I don't care whose it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just like to be naked and they better
understand because I'm just trying not to
[SPEAKER_04]: leave gardens is what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, it's yeah, it's like typically
people when they bring in clones and trade
[SPEAKER_04]: clones, you're going to run to the PM
because it's in a lot of people's rooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in a room that's never had it,
like you don't have your IPM running for
[SPEAKER_04]: it, you're going to run into different
clones for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of times you can come in on
clothes, you can come in on your deck
[SPEAKER_04]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes nudity doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: You try.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a short vector.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's short path.
[SPEAKER_08]: What were you even talking?
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of remember what I even asked.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like how.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you talk about plants and stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's all my favorite plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think I got distracted by talking
about like how messed up have you like how
[SPEAKER_08]: devastated, you know, have I can't even
talk right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I've wasted a bunch of
plants, I will say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like, like I wanted to learn about
like I wanted to try making rosin,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like hash and stuff,
which I have done successfully.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I first tried it, I did not,
you know, wasted tons of plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just not tons.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wasted plants, you know,
trying to do that stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just it's all a learning process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like you you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, with cannabis, like you
read about stuff and there is a ton of
[SPEAKER_02]: good information, but it's also mixed in
with like tons of bro science from the
[SPEAKER_02]: last 30 years that you have to sit through
and decide if it's legit or not,
you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that might be a good segue into
the kind of what I think is like the tail
[SPEAKER_08]: end of this combo, but I think quite a
also quite a big topic in and of itself,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is, you know, what do you all think
a good grow means?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what is good?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, what are the because we like
like some of you have mentioned already,
[SPEAKER_08]: like there's some myths that float around.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's about yield.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about this or that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's about pumping them with
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about pumping them with light,
you know, those things.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are your thoughts on some of these
myths?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, any pet peeves like for me,
for example, I got really hung up on the
[SPEAKER_08]: idea that plants should be given one
thousand PPFT, for example, for flowering,
[SPEAKER_08]: like it was a rule.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I insisted on it for a couple of runs
and it was actually just fucking me up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I had to take a step back and be like,
why are you doing this?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, why are you just sticking to this
weird number that, you know, someone
[SPEAKER_08]: pulled out of a hat seemingly?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can pick any any myth in
cannabis, you know, like to start with
[SPEAKER_04]: here, how people germinate seeds,
you know, is wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I always found it to be best to stay
as clean as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: But other people have different opinions
on that, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably one of my biggest pet
peeves, though, is I like people to be as
[SPEAKER_04]: cleanly as possible and not introduce one
bacteria to where they may be popping
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, yeah, that's probably my only
major one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not too picky.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone else like, you know, what has
anyone kind of like absorbed something and
[SPEAKER_08]: then kind of regretted that, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I did the same kind of stuff
like with lighting as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, there was like growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it just takes time to like,
like all of it is just like you get this
[SPEAKER_02]: light that's like the first time you ever
get an LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you have the sun in your
basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like, it is so fucking bright,
you know, and it's like, I know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the first time when I first started
growing gum, like I had this clone in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I didn't I had my light turned
down all the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't realize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I had it turned up to a good
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for like, like a month,
this clone just basically sat in like
[SPEAKER_02]: stasis, like didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, what is fucking going on
right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just like look at my stuff and
it's like, oh, you're an idiot,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, it's really easy to just
overlook one little thing like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, then you kind of beat yourself
up about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, you that's the only way you're
going to learn those things for me,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like is to fuck up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've still never even seen LED.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like not in my own room.
[SPEAKER_04]: LED lights over plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think one of the one of the
general myths that I've seen that's like
[SPEAKER_00]: been going on for the last couple of years
is kind of the whole and it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: joke now, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the whole Athena jungle boy feed three
three point five EC deal, which I think
[SPEAKER_00]: what a lot of people don't understand is
that if you're not running LED super hot,
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms like between 85 to 90 degrees
pushing CO2 and super high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants, you know, not drinking a
lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in those perfect conditions,
they get away with those super heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: feedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a home grower, when when the
room's a little bit cooler, like let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: you run 80 and your humidity maybe is
closer to 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plant starts drinking super fast
that way, because having the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: lower and the temperature higher makes the
plant drink more, you'll burn your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I think that's that's like
one of those myths that a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in myself included, I didn't
understand why I was doing it originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that I understand how the plant
uptakes nutrients and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize, OK, I can push my plant another
way and feed it much less lower amount per
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding and still get the results I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I also think that just in
general, like what just to add on what
[SPEAKER_02]: Spindle was saying is that like it like
there it being able to feed three and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half BC isn't the goal that you're working
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even if you do have those perfect
conditions and you're able to feed it
[SPEAKER_02]: easy, that doesn't mean that you have good
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we've everyone now has smoked
jungle boys and cookies packs and like
[SPEAKER_02]: knows what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not like people aren't like
going crazy over that weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like I don't I don't have any
rooms that run that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any tents that can have those
optimal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what their plants
necessarily need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like maybe in those conditions,
that's what some of their strains actually
[SPEAKER_00]: require.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't have that situation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just such an interesting impulse
to me, though, underlying all of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like basically the idea is that
maximalism is good and it doesn't there's
[SPEAKER_08]: no real justification for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't think any of us really need
to be getting four pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's not that's not our goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think they have very different goals
than we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so they're able to do things we
can't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I mean, it must work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to some level for some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they can't all be producing
terrible weed, but no.
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe what we're getting to is that
like with breeding, right, like this,
[SPEAKER_08]: there's always going to be a context for
your growth.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what are you growing for?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's what we're approaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you were kind of asking like
what the goals are of what a good grow
[SPEAKER_00]: would be to each of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that the question?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think that's a I think that's
another way of asking it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe we can have a go at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, for each of you, what do you aim
for?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, what what what makes like a
happy grow or happy run?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, local, you need to chill out with
the Oreos and shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can hear it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But local, you go, you're up.
[SPEAKER_08]: What makes a happy plant or run for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's I mean, that's really hard to
quantify.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as long as my plants aren't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, looking extremely deficient in
one thing and resin content looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I would expect it to turn
out to be, then in a way that is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a marker for a successful run.
But.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always things that can improve,
you know, but that's that's kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: the minimum I see as like, you know,
I'm going to smoke this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, I'll qualify that like
success here is definitely in quote marks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the whole idea is that we all have
different senses of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of just curious about unpacking
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Aaron, thoughts on.
[SPEAKER_08]: What makes for a successful or happy plant
to run?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm kind of the same as local,
you know, it's not like I'm a I just want
[SPEAKER_02]: my plants to look generally healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I kind of gauge that off of like
I take cuts pretty often off of my mom's
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff and like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want them to root,
you know, around the same speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm always just like watching
stuff to make sure that everything seems
[SPEAKER_02]: to be going the way that I expect it to
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of what it like.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of like my goal right now is
to just look through different stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: find weed that I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, these guys have access
to stuff that like I've never smoked like
[SPEAKER_02]: named weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like from anyone like I just don't have
access to that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been like me just kind of finding
like a place of like stuff that I like and
[SPEAKER_02]: then kind of trying to go from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, like a successful run is to pop
a pack and make it through and like feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like I saw a good expression of that line
and like be able to make a decision if I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to continue growing that direction.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think for me, one of my kind of
idealist thoughts on this on the subject
[SPEAKER_08]: was a good grower means that, like you
said, the plant can express itself as
[SPEAKER_08]: fully as possible or like kind of fulfill
its potential to like the maximum degree.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I say idealist because, you know,
you don't really know that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the only way you can actually know
whether it's fulfilling its potential is
[SPEAKER_08]: if you've run it multiple times and
possibly under different conditions.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I still think it's like obviously a
noble goal to be like to see each plant as
[SPEAKER_08]: having a certain degree of potential and
in your grow just trying to see whether
[SPEAKER_08]: you can meet that, you know, in some form.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's one of the ways I think
about it now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Michael, thoughts on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at this point, I've had enough
harvests under my belt and like it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount that we harvest, you know,
it used to be like how many pounds per
[SPEAKER_00]: light and how much you could get would be
the general winner of what was a good
[SPEAKER_00]: grower or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at this point with, you know,
weed not being that valuable on a monetary
[SPEAKER_00]: level, really I see success as popping a
pack of seeds that I'm actually interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in and then having, you know, being happy
with the end result of 50% of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I pop a pack and I get seven
females, if four of them come out and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: excited to smoke them or I'm excited to
share them and show them, that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: successful grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's another good, that's another really
good angle, I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that has, like you said, more to do
with like the probabilities around you
[SPEAKER_08]: know, running out of pack and what the
individuals end up being like.
Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's important where you get
your seeds from, you know, like you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're spending money doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to waste time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only have so many harvests in a life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're getting something that is
reputable and that you're happy with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you buy a pack of seeds from
someone that, you know, is new to you and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're junk, you don't find anything
you'd keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't keep throwing money at those same
people, you know, like go with the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that are, you know, giving you something
to live for, something to be happy about,
[SPEAKER_00]: something to be excited to show your
friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking about this, you know,
in terms of like a difference in
[SPEAKER_08]: philosophy between like different people
in the community.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are obviously a large number of
people who will say, I just want to be
[SPEAKER_08]: happy with what I bought.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care who I bought.
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought it from, but I bought it and I
just want to feel okay with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you shouldn't tell me that like I
should care, you know, where I got it
[SPEAKER_08]: from.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there are the people who I think
are more like us, who are in a way like
[SPEAKER_08]: perhaps like never really satisfied and
always looking for better and better.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you do have to look at every little
parameter that you can control,
[SPEAKER_08]: i.e.
[SPEAKER_08]: what the genetics are, who you bought it
from.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it is interesting because it's a
very divisive thing, it feels like,
[SPEAKER_08]: in the growing community.
[SPEAKER_08]: The people who think it doesn't matter
where you get stuff from, you can always
[SPEAKER_08]: find good stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the people who are like, I want to
keep looking harder.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it reminds me of something that
we used to say a lot, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like people used to be real passionate
about cars and I'm going to buy American.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you'd hear those people like,
I'd only buy a Chevy or a Ford,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'd never buy a Japanese car,
you know, because they want to reinvest in
[SPEAKER_00]: their country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have the other, you know,
whatever part of the population that's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want, you know, a good car that's
cheap and it'll run.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I think each individual has
to decide what's important to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not giving my money to someone that I
think is a white supremacist or a child or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those things are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm sure a lot of people don't
give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, yeah, this guy ripped off Caleb
and his whole line is basically just CSI
[SPEAKER_00]: repos, but they're a little bit cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, well, hey, I'll just get it from
Caleb because the dude's legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather spend a few extra bucks and get
it from the guy that deserves the
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition than the dude that just copies
everything Caleb does.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just a different mindset,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it is important.
[SPEAKER_04]: It isn't like, where I spend my money to
me matters because I know like that's a
[SPEAKER_04]: vote for this person existing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a vote for his family.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a good family man out there about his
family.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not, I'm not like, I'm in this for
making lifetime friends on top.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I don't just have customer
relationships with any of my, like people
[SPEAKER_04]: know that they know me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we become friends over time because I
give a shit about the people I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: interacting with.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, it's just, it just depends
on what you're into.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people are just like, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who it's from, if it's dank, it's dank.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of those people also don't like
clearly have not even gotten to the point
[SPEAKER_04]: where they even understand what dank means
to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they haven't even made it that far in
their journey.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still that mindset in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's, that's where I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love seeing the people that I care about
succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit excites me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also find the people that want to
take advantage of their friends that
[SPEAKER_00]: succeed more than anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's just, there's different
types of people in this world,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's like, Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going?
[SPEAKER_08]: You going?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was just going to say coming into
the weed scene, like as like a newer guy,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and just like meeting people on
discord and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I didn't have like a clear
understanding of like what, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: like how, you know, like how small the
scene is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, it's like these dudes know each
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And stuff, you know, and like you like,
you're definitely voted, like whether you
[SPEAKER_02]: like it or not, you're like making a
decision with your money.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you spend on it in such a small
scene, like that kind of money,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, like really goes on, you know,
that really goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if like Matt loses one or two people
away, it's not like seed sellers are like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, have millions of customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's very small.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you, yeah, I mean, you should
like buy obviously like, I want to smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: good weed, but if the choice is smoke good
weed and support shitty people,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just will not smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there, this also goes two ways
with some of us too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, um, there's a lot of us as seed
makers and this really screws people up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when they email me and they're like,
yeah, I'm going to drop three grand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they proceed to like, you know,
like down talk me and be rude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just be like, dude, I don't need your
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: You sound like an asshole.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm not even into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's not, it's, it doesn't matter if
it, it would keep the business running
[SPEAKER_04]: longer in many cases.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just doesn't matter to me because bad
people don't need to touch plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact of the matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it passes down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think bad juju flies with this shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you see it time and time again,
where people support bad people making
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds and time and time again,
bad things happen to these people
[SPEAKER_04]: throughout their lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this stuff travels and carries on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a very spiritual person,
but some things in life are just evidence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants are living.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, plants are living beings.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I do think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, like, I think about like,
um, when I have gotten plants from,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've like, you know, gotten packs from
people and started growing them out and
[SPEAKER_02]: like been mid, I mean, I've been mid
flower and found stuff out about the
[SPEAKER_02]: people that made them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, I, there's nothing in me that
wants to smoke those plants anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just, I've thrown them, I've thrown
whole plants out just truthfully.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just am very much like, I got like a big
part of this is really cool as the
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like now that I'm a part of it,
I don't, I, yeah, I just can't support
[SPEAKER_02]: like shitty people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only, not only that, but if people
don't, you know, if not enough of us vote
[SPEAKER_00]: with their dollar and in the end of this,
we're left with, you know, a compound and
[SPEAKER_00]: seed junkie.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all, we're all in the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's going to be a shitty world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also think that even if,
even if one were ethically or morally
[SPEAKER_08]: indifferent to that situation,
there are enough good options on the
[SPEAKER_08]: market that you can consider things like
ethics and community when you make these
[SPEAKER_08]: decisions, because it's not like we don't
have enough sources at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can buy a pack from pack or
high months or Matt, or any of these
[SPEAKER_02]: people that are in the server that are
legit people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing it the right way and not,
you know, not fucking people over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can find a, I mean, I would say a
keeper in every pack almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at this point with a lot of that
stuff, I mean, I've grown through a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: there's like, not, not a lot, but like at
this point I've grown through enough of it
[SPEAKER_02]: that like, I've found plants that are
really good, you know, and it's not like
[SPEAKER_02]: these guys are trying to lie to you or
anything, you know, some, in some of those
[SPEAKER_04]: cases, there are people that I had to
force to sell their seeds like high alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even pack, like these are guys that
like existed and were making stuff that I
[SPEAKER_04]: thought was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, guys, like I think other
people need to see this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really, really good, you know,
and high and lonesome took years and
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: He did not want anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was around before me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he knew like what goes along with
selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: He knew what, he knew all the headaches
that come with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So none of that was interesting to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just likes plants, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, some of these guys, you have to
drag in kicking and screaming,
[SPEAKER_04]: but sometimes it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that he was definitely one
that was worth it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've popped 72 seeds from CSI and I've had
two plants I was disappointed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same, you know, where I was
like, wow, this is kind of goofy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also one of the most difficult
line lines to breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm not surprised, you know,
everything else was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly what it should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the special thing about that too,
is that like he's pretty open about it and
[SPEAKER_04]: says like, you could expect X amount of
booth from this line, blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_04]: blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And being able to tell people with
transparency what to expect, again,
[SPEAKER_04]: is a loss are in seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people don't get that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like just, but just for case in point,
any of these hype strains with any of
[SPEAKER_04]: these like food names, are any of those
like what they're implying?
[SPEAKER_04]: In that case, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we even naming this shit for?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not just call it XYZ123?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit's so annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what, you know, like when you put
blueberry on something, it's blueberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When dynasty says something is going to be
strawberry or pineapple, it's pineapple.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if it's cherry vanilla,
it's cherry vanilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cherry vanilla, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like that's, that shit's
important.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue sushi, I don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck's that even supposed to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had a marijuana that tastes
like a hamburger either.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not an appealing one.
No.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think that was a good,
good exchange about like how we make our,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, buying decisions in this space.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's always going to be a really
interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it weird that it's like all passion
or no passion with it on those answers?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's what divides people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't seem like there's a lot of
middle ground on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: People either tend to be very passionate
or very blase.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's, that's what it seems like to
me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember Sean pointed that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a team sports almost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's hard to not have
communities without that to, to not,
[SPEAKER_04]: because communities are all built on like
passionate ideals, at least the best
[SPEAKER_04]: communities that stay, that stay together
and stand firm or built on passionate
[SPEAKER_04]: ideals and passionate ideals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: They become strong ideals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that definitely leads that team sports
type thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been trying to think of how to,
to keep our group from experiencing that
[SPEAKER_04]: as best we can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I'm, everybody sees me and I'm I
have my own very, very opinionated way of
[SPEAKER_04]: dealing with things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, like trying to
tender that with the idea of it,
[SPEAKER_04]: my own personal opinions affecting the way
other people think, maybe that isn't so
[SPEAKER_04]: smart and trying to figure out how to
maneuver that it's, it's interesting,
[SPEAKER_04]: but yeah, it's always evolving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I too, I think too, like I've
always appreciated, like when I just come
[SPEAKER_02]: in here and having an honest conversation
about like what, what expectations are
[SPEAKER_02]: from what you're growing and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you just don't, I mean,
like when I started growing, that's what I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted was that community to be able to
like talk to the dudes that are like,
[SPEAKER_02]: like growing these plants and working with
them and like get like an idea of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what are they looking for out of this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like what, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just like, it's so much work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you pop a seed, like you don't
realize that you're going to be with that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant for like, you know, you might be
with that plant for a year or more,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's a big commitment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I want to like know about like
what I'm doing and like what, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just so much to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's people that do take it
seriously enough that can tell you that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that I just don't understand why you would
support people that don't take it
[SPEAKER_02]: seriously.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to kind of like tie this together
with some of what I was saying about what
[SPEAKER_08]: makes for a good grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, I like, sorry, tied this
conversation about buying seeds together
[SPEAKER_08]: with that, because for me, one of the cool
things that you get out of buying stuff
[SPEAKER_08]: that is reliable and has descriptions that
you can actually like somewhat trust is
[SPEAKER_08]: that you get to see, you're going to get
to see what people actually say you're
[SPEAKER_08]: going to get to see.
[SPEAKER_08]: So last night, for example, I was actually
asking Matt, Hey, I'm growing this like T
[SPEAKER_08]: 1000 times underdog oracle.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm seeing like some OG leaning things.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, do you think that this is like an
oracle leaning thing?
[SPEAKER_08]: And getting to see that for me is also
part of what makes a good grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, you have questions about
lineage, you have questions about
[SPEAKER_08]: expressions and you get those questions
answered in the grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good grow to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, so we're coming up to where are
we?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're like almost at the two hour mark,
15 minutes away or so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anyone else have any other kind of
like broad reflections on grow philosophy,
[SPEAKER_08]: grow tech, kind of like what I was saying
at the very beginning, this episode is a
[SPEAKER_08]: bit broader.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's meant to be about, yeah, broad tech
and broad like philosophy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think for subsequent episodes,
we can probably pick like topics like mid
[SPEAKER_08]: to late flowering or IPM or stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But for this one, does anyone else have
like any other reflections or like talking
[SPEAKER_08]: points?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one and usually I go last,
but this one I want to hear what these
[SPEAKER_04]: guys have to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the main things with indoor growing
and it was a long journey like trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: chase OG kush cuts over, you know,
that was a real popular thing when I was
[SPEAKER_04]: coming up with OG kush, which kush cut do
you have?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it one of the original legit ones?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember coming across this grow,
or not this grow, this weed in a
[SPEAKER_04]: collective in San Diego called Point Loma
Collective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Point Loma Patients Collective.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was called Tokyo OG, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was the dankest, dankest OG kush
cut I thought I could ever, I was chasing
[SPEAKER_04]: this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember they told me it was a lady
would come in and drop it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the lady was the grower and the
brieger of this cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I remember being in there and
hanging out and waiting for her to come do
[SPEAKER_04]: her drop and trying to catch her,
like just to talk to her.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, hey dude, you know,
let's talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I missed her.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one time she came in when I was there
and I was so bummed and later on,
[SPEAKER_04]: we became friends in life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's when I realized it wasn't that
it was just a special, special OG,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was special.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a great OG kush cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was how well she familiarized herself
with that single cut and truly,
[SPEAKER_04]: truly what I felt mastered it to bring out
its best peak expressions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: She outgrew every fucking OG griller in
San Diego and everybody think having her
[SPEAKER_04]: cut, but it was always obvious when it was
her grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she never passed her cut out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was always obvious when it was her grow
because it was so expertly done and you
[SPEAKER_04]: always knew what it was going to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, shout out to her.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was also a big learning lesson for
me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's the, sorry, Matt, what's the
prompt for people?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what are you asking us to think about
here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, like the fact that, you know,
like there's a lot of clone chasing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do all this clone chasing people trying
to find this clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of times it's not about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's how well you can grow a single clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was kind of what I, I learned an
experience through that whole,
[SPEAKER_04]: whole section, you know, and I don't know
if clone chasing is as popular as it is
[SPEAKER_04]: now, or was then as it is now with this
generation, but that was a huge learning
[SPEAKER_04]: experience for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if anybody else has had
similar experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that's really a lost art
at this point, because if you think about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, Matt, you know, 20 plus years ago,
you'd be lucky to be able to get one
[SPEAKER_00]: elite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like let's say you've got an elite clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably all you're going to be
growing for the next 10 to 15 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to learn that plant inside
and out, you know, like if you've got an
[SPEAKER_00]: OG, you're going to, you're going to learn
how to grow OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whereas now there's so much
available to all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, there's very few plants that I
want to grow more than two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if I do it's for nostalgia more
than anything else, because I'm worried no
[SPEAKER_00]: one else will keep it and it'll be gone
forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, uh, there was a time when I
first started going to dispensaries here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the valley and, uh, you'd go in and
there'd be, you know, 20 different jars of
[SPEAKER_00]: OG, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every name you could think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, you know, I didn't realize at
that point that, uh, Ken had been selling
[SPEAKER_00]: S ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would look through all those jars and
I'd be like, they're all OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just tell some growers,
know what they're doing a little better
[SPEAKER_00]: than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like this guy, whereas now when
I think back, now I'm thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: huh, I wonder if maybe there were
different, that many different OG cuts or
[SPEAKER_00]: if there were just a few handful of cuts,
maybe five or six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these people grew really well or
really poorly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I still, I'm, I'm not a hundred
percent sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I hear SFV, the examples I've
seen, they look identical to the original
[SPEAKER_00]: OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I saw when I moved here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there was no SFB OG back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm still confused about
that too, but I think your point's very
[SPEAKER_00]: well taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when someone knows how to grow
something it's going and they make that
[SPEAKER_00]: their love or their passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet if I was able to smoke a high and
lonesome's Appalachia, it'd probably,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, be the farthest thing from
skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so yeah, I definitely see where
you are with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it reminds me, Matt, we should,
one of the other, one of the kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: topics that we could cover in a future
episode is like preservation and
[SPEAKER_08]: propagation, you know, like all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember like Chimera also had some
stuff to say about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it would be funny if we could maybe
include him in one of these.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone else local?
[SPEAKER_08]: Any, any last thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to press the unmute button.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got electric boogalooed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think running a clone, like if you're
set on a cut, I think every time you rerun
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you're going to learn something about
how it does express.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think like, obviously in that you're
going to learn what you can tweak to make
[SPEAKER_01]: the ride a little smoother the next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do think that that is like,
you know, something really important,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when you're kind of learning a
cut, you know, to learn what you can do to
[SPEAKER_01]: maximize its potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like OGs and stuff like,
goddamn, I wouldn't even know where to
[SPEAKER_01]: start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like any OG hybrid I've had has just
looked like ass under my conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's because I grow in pure cocoa
and that's like not the way to grow OG
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did want to I did want to highlight
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you talk about rerunning a plant
and getting to learn it better,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is obviously true.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in rerunning a plant, you actually
learn more about your setup as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: That too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Bodhi used to say, don't just
grow your plant, grow with your plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Say it's not just you, you learning the
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also your plant learning your
environment and adapting as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good point.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any last?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that just to what Matt was saying with
the learning its environment and that kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, that's the biggest point
that I would make would be honestly,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, don't worry about getting plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't don't be so stressed about getting
parts for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think that like these things do
have work that you can find stuff that is
[SPEAKER_02]: on that level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of a seed pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that you're more than likely
to find something that grows better in
[SPEAKER_02]: your environment that way as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like you get to do the selection
from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just would say, like, I just for me,
clones don't seem like something that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: super it's not something that I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: To make it clear, I guess we're talking
about like clones in two different ways.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's like clones with uppercase C,
i.e.
[SPEAKER_08]: elite clones that people look like.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: Clones of your own stuff that you're just
rerunning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I definitely like, I think that it's
very valuable to like run your stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple times and learn it because like
all these guys will tell you that like
[SPEAKER_02]: that they like the clones settle in and
like do different things and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like it is worth spending that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying maybe just spend time with
something that you find cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: What someone else finds quote unquote
elite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when you really find out who the guys
were choosing these old elite clones,
[SPEAKER_04]: the way they were running their plans and
you see their pictures on the forums,
[SPEAKER_04]: you will appreciate the word elite a lot
differently, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people realize, man, I'm way better
growing that dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm growing way better shit than them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in a way better situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe what I'm choosing is more elite to
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's that's a legit thing to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that can happen a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's every everything is subjective
when it comes to what is quote unquote
[SPEAKER_04]: elite in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's that's a big, big learning
lesson.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say as well that I'm sorry,
Michael, just quickly say that there are
[SPEAKER_08]: lots of hierarchies in this in this
community and people wanting to preserve
[SPEAKER_08]: those hierarchies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether they're hierarchies of clones,
hierarchies of breeders, people are
[SPEAKER_08]: fighting to preserve these weird ladders.
[SPEAKER_08]: And often they are just mythical.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they're just made up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Smoking mirrors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Michael, what were you going to
say?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think there's there's benefits
to both because you should definitely look
[SPEAKER_00]: through seeds and find what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, if people talk about
something that you missed out on for long
[SPEAKER_00]: enough, you know, it'd be nice to try
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like when I hear about Day
Wrecker and stuff like that, I wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: around for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That never made it into I'd never heard of
it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something I'd want to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not saying it'd be like the
elite cut that I'm going to grow the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there is such a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But getting to experience those things,
I think it means a lot to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people that missed it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard about Chem D and Chem 91 for 20
some years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see them like the real thing,
to know the real thing is in front of me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, not just something made up,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I try to tell these kids so
often, not kids, people that are coming
[SPEAKER_04]: into the scene now, that like the way that
you get those clones, it's so hard to buy
[SPEAKER_04]: them and get legitimate copies by buying
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I don't think they're for sale.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if they do, it's usually through the
back door and like they're not going to
[SPEAKER_04]: get good provenance on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to be able to ask
someone, hey, did you get it legit from
[SPEAKER_04]: this dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like that's never going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're never going to be able to really
reassure yourself taking the buying route.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just be a good person and make friends
in the community, learn shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how we all fell into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like everybody in our group knows
like, fuck, I put all my clones out there
[SPEAKER_04]: and said, fuck it, take what you want,
crew, don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's how it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it takes a lot of trust and building
time, sharing time with people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not about buying shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those things are there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those things are there to get and to be
had and to try at just knowing the right
[SPEAKER_04]: people and just being decent human,
really.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, one thing about, sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, Michael.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a latency thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Blame me being by the South Pole.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just say that
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to say too, like I had bought two
packs of chili Verde and I didn't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: pop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went and I got from purple city
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a clone of the chili Verde.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew it out and I sent is a HPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent him pictures and I was like,
this is really nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, oh, you know,
that's not actually my cut of chili Verde.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just one they picked out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was, I was kind of disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, huh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I popped a pack of chili Verde.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found something so much better than that
elite that they were selling all over
[SPEAKER_00]: California in that first pack where I was
like, oh my God, this is why he calls it
[SPEAKER_00]: what he calls it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you find it chili Verde if you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: His original cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, when he brought it down here,
it smelled like, like carne asada,
[SPEAKER_04]: the chili Verde.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smelled exactly like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was mind blown.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every, every chili Verde that I
smelled since is someone else's selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's nowhere near as good as his was
the purple city one was really sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then the one I found in the
seed pack was just like, so unique.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, yeah, there's unique shit in
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the point I was trying to make,
I think, with respect to what Matt was
[SPEAKER_08]: saying about how you become connected and
actually create relationships with people.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a confusion in the,
in the industry or community where people
[SPEAKER_08]: don't know if they're meant to be acting
like customers or like community members.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not even their fault because lots
of discords or communities, they are like
[SPEAKER_08]: treated like customers and they,
they become used to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they, they have entitlements as a
customer would feel like they might have.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas once they come into a real,
you know, quote unquote real community,
[SPEAKER_08]: like ours, it's totally different.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't act like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't just assume that these are all
transactional exchanges and that you can
[SPEAKER_08]: just expect certain things.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I kind of say the thing
about the clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just because like coming from
where I'm at, like being an unconnected,
[SPEAKER_02]: new grower, the best way that I could get
access to good weed was to find good
[SPEAKER_02]: seats.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, yeah, buying,
I'm so thankful that I didn't get into
[SPEAKER_02]: buying stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, cause you just hear nightmares
of people ruining their entire grows from
[SPEAKER_02]: getting some weird pests or something,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, once you get a pest and
you've torn down your room three times and
[SPEAKER_00]: you keep getting it back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The gift that keeps on giving,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a demon right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the wheel at the Santa Cruz super
might.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing that thing a few times,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a bed bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can live in the sheets for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me and CSI joked about the spider mites
that like would drink fluoromite and like
[SPEAKER_04]: laugh at you as they chug it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen it all, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like to the point of where it like,
it was completely obsolete to even use any
[SPEAKER_04]: of those harsh pens anymore because they
were just so like they didn't work
[SPEAKER_04]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to find legit means of using like
real predators and stuff to kill these
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we need to have an IPM episode as
well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, you know, we're coming up to the
two hour mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we've covered a lot of ground
today.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope to see.
[SPEAKER_08]: These guys back again, and we might even
have different people coming in maybe as
[SPEAKER_08]: well for future indoor growing episodes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We might end up having a proper hydro
episode as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully we'll see some of you back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything else from anyone or
Matt?
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: When people are watching this,
it'll be later.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't wish him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can wish him a happy birthday
when this airs, but yes, this is new,
[SPEAKER_00]: new, a pretty, a new drop coming pretty
soon from goat farm and already up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm about to put a Brian Berry coffee.
[SPEAKER_04]: Michael can be a host.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can help me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't have to say crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any last shout outs from anyone?
[SPEAKER_08]: Local shout out to my line.
[SPEAKER_01]: John glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Chuck glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else got any shout outs?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for just having me on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is cool to talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you got Michael.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you shout out to it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I'll shout out glass by C2.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like my favorite glass on earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the only thing I'll use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll second that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's no bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all use it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not because he's sponsored.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because it's legit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Watch the episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: Watch the glass episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a really, really good one.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are sleeping.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got anything birthday boy?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, just happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy to be invited.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just happy to be along for the ride,
