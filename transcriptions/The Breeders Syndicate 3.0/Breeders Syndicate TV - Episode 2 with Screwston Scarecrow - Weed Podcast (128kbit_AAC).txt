[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, let's get to the episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's me, Chuckie Pollins, back again with
a little episode, episode two of Breeders
[SPEAKER_04]: Syndicate TV.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm here with my buddy Scrooge from
the Breeders Syndicate Discord.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's happening?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just just chilling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Burning a hole in my pants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just dropped a cherry on my dick.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got sweat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got sweatpants on, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: All my sweatpants got fucking little holes
in them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And shit, because, you know, I dropped my
cherry on them and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But but yeah, man, I'm glad to have you
here today, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been doing I've been doing these
little episodes with people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the viewers will have only seen
the EpiHills one by now by the time this
[SPEAKER_04]: one airs.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, man, basically the focus of the
podcast is to kind of talk about what's
[SPEAKER_04]: going on in the Breeders Syndicate
Discord.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on with Matt and the Ken
Illuminati guys, like all the Breeder
[SPEAKER_04]: dudes and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And today I wanted to have you on and just
kind of talk about you and what's going on
[SPEAKER_04]: with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with this podcast, it's kind of it's
more than I guess highlight some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: other people in the Discord that maybe
aren't Breeders and just are regular
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kind of want to just see what
everybody's got going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you could start me off, bro,
with maybe how you first came into contact
[SPEAKER_04]: with weed, maybe like the first time you
smoked, first time you saw it,
[SPEAKER_04]: like how old were you, stuff like that,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I so I grew up in Southern
California for like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: till I was 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my uncles are really close in age to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we grew up like brothers because it
took my grandma and grandpa a while to
[SPEAKER_00]: have another kid after my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my uncle, Matt, sold weed to,
you know, his girlfriend's brother was a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, I guess, which I didn't find that
stuff out until, you know, being an adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, I came across some weed in his
room one time and, you know, we all got
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking beat for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't smoke any till, you know,
after I came to Texas and I was like 12
[SPEAKER_00]: and me and my friend took some some weed
from his mom and rolled a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took his mom's little joint roller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like the two bars with the
plastic piece in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we've rolled one way too
tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from that first that first smoke,
I knew, oh, shit, I like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that started my journey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you so you got high for your first
time then the first time you try to smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I feel like I did, but I know I
didn't inhale at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I didn't know the mechanics of
inhaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I thought you're just holding it
in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess some got in somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might have been when I was coughing or
whatever, because it wasn't until like a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of months later.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was smoking a cigarette in front of
someone and they're like, you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking inhaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like showed me how to inhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, you know, that was a whole
nother revelation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I was probably I would have been a
freshman.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess I was younger than everybody in
my class for the most part.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I was 13.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my parents didn't really smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my mom, I found out recently my mom
smoked maybe like four or five times as we
[SPEAKER_04]: grew up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was just like when she was going
through shit and she would do it while we
[SPEAKER_04]: weren't home.
[SPEAKER_04]: But but my parents weren't really
partiers.
[SPEAKER_04]: My both my parents were my dad was in the
military and my mom was in the Navy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like it wasn't like they were hardcore
about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like they just didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But and we just didn't have a lot of
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like getting money for like weed and
booze was just like not even the option
[SPEAKER_04]: when you got three kids anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So but what well, for my parents,
at least I guess some parents do that
[SPEAKER_04]: shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: First time I got high was not the first
time I got weed or rolled a joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: This fucking guy, he was a senior,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: His name was Donovan and he kind of had a
lisp and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he he was real cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was just fucking weirdo in my math
class.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like really bad at math.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was behind.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they had me in a basic some kind of
math class my freshman year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this guy had failed a bunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I took notice of him because he'd come
in every day and literally just sleep all
[SPEAKER_04]: day.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just slept every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the times that he would talk,
I thought he was hilarious, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: He reminded me of like a Cheech and Chong
type of motherfucker, dude, like somebody
[SPEAKER_04]: from a movie like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And his eyes were so red.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, dude, I just want to know
more about him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to talking to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he showed me like he brought Hot Times
magazines and would tell me shit about
[SPEAKER_04]: like Black Widow and White Widow and like
all this shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just like captivated me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he he gave me some seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went over his house one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had like this fucking ghetto set up in
the garage with like heat lamps and shit
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, plants this big or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he that day he gave me like it was
Reggie.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I had seeds and shit,
but like a joint basically to roll.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he gave me a paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went home like the next day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like the weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: My parents left and I tried rolling it up,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I got so much slobber and shit on
the joint that it was just terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't like I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had never been around people that smoked
or nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: My mom smoked cigarettes, but I never
fucked with cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, bro, I just like tried hitting it,
tried smoking and all this shit on the
[SPEAKER_04]: front porch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I just did nothing happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really understand like what was
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it wasn't like it was probably
two years later when I was like 15.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started hanging out with like some older
guys that could drive, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we would in Kentucky like your
parents, a lot of people weren't cool with
[SPEAKER_04]: weed back then, especially.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you would we would call back.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would back row is what we would call
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like me and, you know, three,
four guys or girls, whatever, would hop in
[SPEAKER_04]: a car and hit up like a one lane road that
goes on for like 20 miles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we would, you know, roll up and smoke
on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's like some of the first times I
really remember getting actually high
[SPEAKER_04]: because, yeah, but we we that's where I
picked up smoking blunts, bro,
[SPEAKER_04]: was with them, with those guys,
because we had Reggie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like to smoke to smoke that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to have like flavored ass fucking
wraps and shit.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, it's also it's a lot
harder to roll a joint with compressed
[SPEAKER_00]: weed with brickweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like that shit just doesn't want
to lay right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Years later, dude, I got one of those
fucking before I learned how to actually
[SPEAKER_04]: roll.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got one of those little plastic
cigarette rollers like you were talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about your your your family had.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those those were all right if you
actually would grind it up and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, the first few times I didn't
even I mean, I still don't really use a
[SPEAKER_04]: grinder much today unless I'm using the
volcano or a joint specifically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, once I really like to break it
up with my hands, bro, and just feel it
[SPEAKER_04]: and something about that process,
like the anticipation of it and like it's
[SPEAKER_04]: meant it's a mental thing, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, well, I mean, also functionally,
you know, a blunt rap isn't going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked up with your with your fingers
being sticky, you know, like like a paper
[SPEAKER_00]: clock, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to break it up like I get the paper
prepared and then I break the weed up with
[SPEAKER_00]: the grinder just to like trying minimize,
you know, messing with it with sticky
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers because paper tear pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you get it now, if you're rocking
some shit like swishers, bro, that shit's
[SPEAKER_04]: garbage, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: The the fucking I don't know if you
remember or if you all have swishers,
[SPEAKER_04]: but swisher sweets, they're fucking
usually when you get them here,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're they're bone dry, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you crack they're like you open them up
and they're popping apart and falling
[SPEAKER_04]: apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have sticky weed and you're
rolling with those, those are garbage.
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, I mean, dude, honestly,
like I need to get off these
[SPEAKER_04]: motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, right now I got the I do the
volcano as much as I can.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like if I'm on a podcast or when I
first wake up, I like a little nicotine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll smoke a I'll smoke a blunt.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just something I like to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know people shit all over it,
but it's just what I like to do,
[SPEAKER_04]: bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like flavor or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried the palms or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I do not like those at all,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They exactly like smoking a palm leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what you'd expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I look like this, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I pass up on like a lot of shit in life,
like mainly food and things, sweets and
[SPEAKER_04]: shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can enjoy a little bit of nicotine,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the best thing for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know it ain't.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's you know, it is what it is,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't drink.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, you know, if it kills me,
bro, it kills me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just I just I just enjoy I enjoy a nice
blunt every once in a while, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but at that party, when we all
met up with with with the guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: dude, only person that didn't smoke it was
earned, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody else was kind of like,
I like this shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is this was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And fucking I know I talk about Rob Clark
all the time, but to this day,
[SPEAKER_04]: H&L brings this up, but he like blew his
mind in my mind that Rob Clark's just
[SPEAKER_04]: smoking blunts back to back, like smoking
joints, smoking fucking bong rips,
[SPEAKER_04]: all the shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like all night for hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, especially the weed that y'all
brought to like that says something
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's a lot, you know,
you watch these fucking podcasts or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you see these events and shit
where people are smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, y'all are smoking weed that
like you can smoke a fucking half ounce
[SPEAKER_00]: and just kind of be buzzing a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like that ain't shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, no fucking all the different
kinds of shit that y'all brought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that's pretty fucking impressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me let me talk about this for a
second, actually, because it was so
[SPEAKER_04]: awesome, dude, like one of the guys
brought a bunch of like black film
[SPEAKER_04]: canisters, you know, like little half
quarter size kind of jars or little
[SPEAKER_04]: plastic flip things or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they passed them out like four or five
to everybody and they're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: fill them up with whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, of course, there's,
you know, 30 different options to choose
[SPEAKER_04]: from.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not like like hanging out with
your homeboys where it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, pretty much not all the same
shit like rec weed, but like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of times you're sharing cuts or
popping similar shit or, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this shit was like, I mean,
I'm talking from like haze to like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, geez, and all this weird fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, you know, because these are from
guys from different states and different
[SPEAKER_04]: parts of the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're all in the same discord,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: But everybody kind of brought their own
little thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and or their own flavors and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And H&L brought a bunch of them mango
hazes, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just being able to like experience
that on a level like that and just being
[SPEAKER_04]: able to try all the different ones like
the rank stranger, the electric mango.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a couple other ones that he had.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, it was awesome, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would fill those.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were like, fill up the canisters with
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we go out on the bass boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're there to bass fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're out there for like eight hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we fill up these little canisters.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got local sweet pea in there because
I got all the different things in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And dude, it was awesome, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fucking just I don't know what I
thought about this shit for everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a kid like just being able to hang
out with some of you guys that I didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: really know who they were at the time,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: But but just dreaming of like being
isolated in a country, rural area,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially where, you know, weed is not
legal and it's not fucking cool really
[SPEAKER_04]: with anybody other than the, you know,
other than like the stoner kids or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever the outcast people like have an
opportunity to like hang out with dudes
[SPEAKER_04]: like that and smoke their weed and like,
you know, and all of them are sweethearts,
[SPEAKER_04]: bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all really good to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it was a dream come true
for me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dude, I bet I I feel you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not it was not safe here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, it's still not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a hell of a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're not going to go to a
fucking prison after fucking life,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, any, you know, none of that
craziness anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before, yeah, no, it was not cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, fuck, I didn't get connected to
like the online world or fuck,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because I don't know, it's not like
that out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep your mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it was I get the experience of
like, I want this, you know, being the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking kid in in school is like,
no, I want to fucking do this like and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone being like, shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you're not it's that's not
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fucking go to college or whatever,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now I guess you can totally
fucking do it legitimately, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cool to see the change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for me, like going from Kentucky is
probably is a lot similar because,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, a lot of people there are,
you know, church going folks and stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: like that from where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people do look at or for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say like in the last like five,
six, seven years, people like change their
[SPEAKER_04]: tune.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we just went medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year, so so people are like coming
around to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, growing up, like catching
getting caught with weed and shit was not
[SPEAKER_04]: good, bro, and especially growing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like growing it, that's why it took me
forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It like took the first time I grew was
probably 17, 18 and like a little cabinet
[SPEAKER_04]: thing that I bought from fucking Lowe's,
bro, save up money working at Quiznos.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I bought this like little tool
cabinet, cut a holes in the back,
[SPEAKER_04]: mounted the PC fans on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was using shoe boxes and a little
net pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was doing I guess it would be DWC,
if you want to call it that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, and there and I was doing it at
mom's house.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my brother ratted me out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had it in the closet.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't get but, you know,
10 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they were healthy, like they actually
fruit for the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went up to this little hydroponic store
and I read on I was on 420 Chan at the
[SPEAKER_04]: time, like trying to learn how to learn
how to grow and I was downloading a Jorge
[SPEAKER_04]: Cervantes videos grow like the old ones
from my back in the day where he's got the
[SPEAKER_04]: dreadlock wig on and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was downloading those off like
Pirate Bay and shit watching them and
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to learn how to learn how to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I saved up enough money with my
buddy and we got a house out in the middle
[SPEAKER_04]: of nowhere.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right it was like perfect time.
[SPEAKER_04]: They like it was the first time I really
seen grow tents come online.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got like I got a grow tent and I got
a real big giant like there's like the
[SPEAKER_04]: shoe box.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the totes for like shoes that go
underneath your bed.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not that tall, about six inches
tall, but real wide.
[SPEAKER_04]: This tent was probably like a two by four
or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had an old old DFL spiral lights
with like low fucking reflectors with the
[SPEAKER_04]: clips in the big ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just brought that out a few times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every time I get to the point where I
was going to do like 1212, my landlord
[SPEAKER_04]: would like show up like one time the house
started vibrating like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I was literally in there fucking
with those plants and the house is like
[SPEAKER_04]: vibrating, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck is going on, man?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I go outside and my landlord,
which never come by, he never comes by.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's on the roof with some other dude like
blowing leaves out the gutter and he's
[SPEAKER_04]: like, yeah, bro, I'm a little come in and
put a new sink in sometime next week,
[SPEAKER_04]: just giving you a heads up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like every time I do some shit like
that, that would happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe to keep it on you, bro,
I'm high and rambling.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's what's the first time you maybe
started to grow and stuff and mess around
[SPEAKER_04]: with that or got the idea of it or tried
or or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, it was pretty much
immediately trying just because I didn't I
[SPEAKER_00]: did not you know, obviously I didn't have
a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doing like touring for other people,
washing cars and mowing lawns and shit
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I could not keep up with the amount
that I smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I figured fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm you know, my only option is to grow
this, which I have no agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: background.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's you know, I didn't have anybody
who who actually grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a ton of you know, like one of
the guys I bought weed from and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the high schoolers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He you know, he pretended to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he'd be telling me shit and I'd be
trying it and fucking fail entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I didn't know the whole 1212
thing to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was it was a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was just trying to grow for
the longest time unsuccessfully,
[SPEAKER_00]: very unsuccessfully.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you ever have somebody tell you that
Donovan guy was talking about in high
[SPEAKER_04]: school?
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to grow a couple of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did try to pop a couple of those seeds
years back when I was probably like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, 13 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he told me to use a black light,
bro, back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he just said, put a black light on 24
hours and let him grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, of course, you know,
they got enough energy and shit that
[SPEAKER_04]: they'll pop up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like, I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm like they popped about the
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my dad asked my dad found them,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had him like a T.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, back in the day, the big TVs
like the CRT or whatever, they would have
[SPEAKER_04]: big entertainment centers and a lot of
times they'd have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, with the doors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put put a couple of pots and soil in
there and some of those seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just this motherfucker never came up
there, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for some reason, he can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: He came up there and open that up and he
was like, what's in there growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just like, oh, you know,
I was fucking around some tomato plants
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff, you know, and he bought it or
maybe he did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he he told me stories about what got
me one to try that is because he told me
[SPEAKER_04]: stories about how he smoked like when he
was a kid, which was like he was saying
[SPEAKER_04]: like Colombian red and Acapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was talking about five finger lids
or licks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think his lids, ain't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All this shit like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he did mushrooms and acid and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a bunch, but he would tell me shit
about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was really into watching movies,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we watched like Fast Times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we watched, of course,
Cheech and Chong and like just kind of all
[SPEAKER_04]: this got me curious about everything,
you know, over the years and fucking with
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I unfortunately couldn't even grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually entered into it more from like
like dealing side of it, because like you,
[SPEAKER_04]: I realized quickly, like I can't afford to
fucking buy weed, bro, like I want it to
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everybody kind of realizes that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I realized pretty quickly,
like, man, like I'm going to have to do
[SPEAKER_04]: some skip of the flipper here or something
and make something happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's like everybody's journey,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you you get a zip, you you keep
a fucking a quarter oven.
[SPEAKER_04]: You sell the other three.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is 20 years ago,
mind you.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, break it down and you pay
for your smoke, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's yeah, I was bad at that,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept I kept trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one of those the little like balance
scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, got it my fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought an ounce and it's, you know,
just swag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, you know, man, I just end up
smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I tried the same thing
whenever I had, you know, made the switch
[SPEAKER_00]: to draw only.
And.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, fuck, man, I bought a quarter
pound and was like, oh, I'm there's no way
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be, you know, before is just
because I had too little.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it wasn't that good as smokes
too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but then you got, you know,
me and my friend taking a fucking eighth
[SPEAKER_00]: out to just go drive around town and fuck
off and doing that every day, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then getting home smoking more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was so bad at selling weed that
one of my one of my best friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: I met him because he was selling selling
phones at T-Mobile in the mall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried to sell him weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, hey, you know, you you need
any weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, do you need any weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my fucking dumbass is like,
oh, well, let me check out what you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I end up fucking buying some of his
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that, you know, everybody was a dude
right in my town.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to want to be or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like for for a long time, I would just
rock with this one guy when he ended up
[SPEAKER_04]: going to jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the time, my only income was weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember at that time he got locked
up for a month, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he he was pivotal for my success and
what I did because he was not from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he was from like Cincinnati.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he had connects, you know, out of state
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And long story short, he was my plug for
like fucking 10 years, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he ended up going to jail at one
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it made me realize I fucking I need
to have other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, yeah, I would take more risk
after that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if somebody was like, yo, I got weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, any kind of weight, I would go
check it out, even if it was kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: risky, just because like I said at the
time, I just didn't understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like how I would be able to manage a
normal job, bro, because I've been doing
[SPEAKER_04]: this for so long that like it gave me
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like at that point, I was young,
still growing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you don't even develop fully
until you're like 25.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm I'm just getting to the point I'm
at 20s where I'm starting to use my head a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when he went to jail, bro,
like I would meet anybody if I saw you
[SPEAKER_04]: buying real estate, like, yo, man,
you, you know, you buy weed and then like,
[SPEAKER_04]: and if they were like, not really,
if they did say, yo, I got weed,
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'll go check their shit out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me, I did I did the same shit as
you did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sucked at selling weed for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I smoke it all until I met this guy by
chance, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was making music at the time and I was
making beats and I was making beats to the
[SPEAKER_04]: channel, like collab with people,
you know, I couldn't I'm not like a rapper
[SPEAKER_04]: or nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I could I was just trying to find
somebody to rap over my beats.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I met this kid and he he's a lot
younger than me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when he came over, we smoked and shit
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, you know, my dad sells or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or he's like my stepdad sales.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, oh, for real.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just like everybody,
you know, at that time would be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I got weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it usually was shitty, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this fucking guy, I go over his house
one day to record with him and his dad
[SPEAKER_04]: comes down and he brings two ounces of
whatever it was at the time, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the best weed I've ever seen in life,
other than maybe like some GDP or
[SPEAKER_04]: something that I'd seen a couple of years
before that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was like the start of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like at that point, after over as time
went on, I quit even hanging out with that
[SPEAKER_04]: kid and recording with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went our separate ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like for like literally like 10 years,
I fucked with that one guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that made me that set me apart from
all my competition in town because they
[SPEAKER_04]: were all fucking with literally the same
two plugs, the main big guys.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was able to differentiate from them.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is mind you, back in like the 350,
$400 a zip like days, it was good times
[SPEAKER_04]: for like a couple of years, because like I
said, I was the only one with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And back then that was before like the big
hype shit really came into play,
[SPEAKER_04]: bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was before whiz and all those
motherfuckers came out with cookies and
[SPEAKER_04]: doing all that bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically it was just more a variety
of weed back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the weed back then, I feel like it's
better than like weed to this day that I
[SPEAKER_04]: was seeing the black market or rec weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, but he was pivotal to my success
there for a long time and pay my bills,
[SPEAKER_04]: bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's ranting.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, so you're fucking around with
weed, you're growing, trying to figure it
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like at what point do you feel like,
or maybe at what point you have your first
[SPEAKER_04]: successful harvesting?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember what it even was?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I had thought I had finally gotten
to where I was harvesting something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't call it successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like oh, six, oh, seven,
even into oh, eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just getting like, because I would
grow way too fucking big in the bench
[SPEAKER_00]: because I still didn't I don't know,
I guess I didn't fucking put together the
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I would end up with super fucking
just like tiny little brats, real wispy,
[SPEAKER_00]: like not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was cool, you know,
but like really wasn't even worth fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: trying and dealing with any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't I didn't actually have like a
like a true successful harvest until
2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went off to the military for a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I don't know, when I got back,
I was like, No, I'm gonna fucking do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read the whole book, I had actually got
like real internet access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because before that, like, you know,
we had a computer and internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my mom, but it's like, that computer
is right outside her her room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't be fucking on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I searched up tits one time and
got fucking caught, you know, like there
[SPEAKER_00]: ain't no way I'm going to be looking how
to grow weed and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, but then I left the house
in 05.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was, you know, I was basically a
fucking street kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, living in this ghetto ass
fucking apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely did not have the Internet for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we didn't have cable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just bad bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, dude, like I I was so disconnected
from the because like I had a phone that I
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't even send text messages on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like call me or nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like I got out of the military
and a phone with the Internet on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like actually pretty decent,
you know, working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's when I started actually
like researching stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know the.
[SPEAKER_00]: The because I dropped out of school so
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made like learning things difficult and
the army really helped me like learn how
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn stuff, like how to teach myself
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was able to like really fucking hit
the ground running and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start getting actual harvests and.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't it was bag seed what I had,
it was either because I had started
[SPEAKER_00]: getting I had also went back to,
you know, like, well, I'm going to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: weed again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was I was pretty
honestly, I was pretty reckless at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I knew I had been jacking up my
cortisol levels like really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a day to day life thing for,
you know, three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made it to where like when I got
out, I just didn't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like this ain't shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Driving back with 50 pounds from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I didn't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can relate to that, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got I got robbed at one point in life,
dude, when I was really young and it
[SPEAKER_04]: happened one time, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was literally over and like a
fucking ounce, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: At gunpoint, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the time, like, bro, the way I
operated was I never always looked at like
[SPEAKER_04]: anything over eight ounces was a felony
report where I was at.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would always try to, you know,
obviously I'm not getting the best
[SPEAKER_04]: discounts operating like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was playing the safest way that I
could.
[SPEAKER_04]: And bro, yeah, I understand how you what
you mean by not giving a fuck because up
[SPEAKER_04]: until that point, like I never had like
issues with anybody over weed or like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you have a couple of people you
get Graham front or whatever that wouldn't
[SPEAKER_04]: pay up shit like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually some chick or whatever,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But up until that point, bro, you know,
I had made a name for myself in that town
[SPEAKER_04]: in my hometown and some cats that had
gotten robbed themselves ended up set me
[SPEAKER_04]: up type shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was reckless at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had fucking three girlfriends.
[SPEAKER_04]: I literally left the party.
[SPEAKER_04]: At two a.m.
[SPEAKER_04]: been drinking, you know, weed on me,
money on me, all this stupid shit,
[SPEAKER_04]: bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was young.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, bro, got held up and everything
was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but after that that moment,
it made me realize like, yo, dude,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you're if this is the life you're
thinking about trying to do and sell weed,
[SPEAKER_04]: it ain't it ain't all fucking rainbows and
gumdrops or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you want to say that?
[SPEAKER_04]: So at that point, like it got a little bit
more serious, you know, for me,
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's like I'm not trying to go
back to work, but I'm also not trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: get robbed again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's that's when I changed
everything up, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't really give a fuck,
but I also was really cautious about what
[SPEAKER_04]: I did and who I dealt with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got really into doing shit like
drops.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would drop shit on like back roads and
shit, bro, for people and not even like
[SPEAKER_04]: meet face to face because up until that
point, bro, I was treating it like a
[SPEAKER_04]: college kid probably would do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just motherfuckers in and out all day
long.
[SPEAKER_04]: People I barely fucking know, you know,
people that are friends of people's
[SPEAKER_03]: friends that, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: However I can make a dollar, basically,
you know, I would do it because,
[SPEAKER_04]: like I said, up until that point,
man, I had never in my life dealt with,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, intense situations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially with like weed because the way
I had been operated before is like weed
[SPEAKER_04]: makes friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, like weed is not that
expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like at the time, especially like some of
the when I was dealing with Reggie,
[SPEAKER_04]: like the shit was cheap as fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like the idea of somebody robbing you
for, you know, 50 bucks worth of Reggie or
[SPEAKER_04]: something like, I don't know, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a fucking weird ass thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But people did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as years went on, there were people,
I mean, I remember stories of some of my
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the people I ended up getting as
customers, bro, talking about how in the
[SPEAKER_04]: city, like a mom with like a kid in the
car, which I would never recommend going
[SPEAKER_04]: and picking weed, especially back then
with a kid in the car, but getting robbed
[SPEAKER_04]: for like a quarter, bro, and gunpoint like
the city for weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but I can relate to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I went on a rant there,
but I can relate to you about having those
[SPEAKER_04]: moments of not giving the shit anymore
because you're like, damn, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wanted to ask you maybe how did how
did I guess you said, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the military kind of straighten you up as
a person in your lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_04]: But is there anything that like as other
than that, that maybe you've taken away
[SPEAKER_04]: from, you know, being in the army that
you've been able to put into your grow,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe like discipline or something?
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you have you used anything that
you've picked up over the years from being
[SPEAKER_04]: in service and applied it to the grow in
any kind of way or the plan or weed in
[SPEAKER_04]: general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess doing clean technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what taking cuts and stuff like that
would be something that because I was a
[SPEAKER_00]: medic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, we learned how to make
sterile fields and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, just the fucking I don't know,
the the ability to learn greatly increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it turns out I just need someone
fucking beating it into me to get it
[SPEAKER_04]: sorted hard headed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, we've talked about like the
beginnings and where, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you get to the point where, you know,
getting out of the service and you're
[SPEAKER_04]: getting harvest under your belts and shit
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe maybe we could talk about,
you know, did you did you eventually find
[SPEAKER_04]: you a crew to be a part of?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you eventually I mean, how did you
figure out about Breeder Syndicate?
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you figure out about Matt?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you could take us there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so I actually like I read about Matt
long before, you know, back then in like
[SPEAKER_00]: 2011, 2012, when I was when I was lurking
on the forums on like THC Farmer was where
[SPEAKER_00]: I mostly looked at stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, I saw a fucking link
to that whole post.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, saw people arguing back and
forth over it, shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like at that point, I knew that I
didn't know enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: To even be able to figure out,
you know, who's telling the truth,
[SPEAKER_00]: who, you know, any of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just I was like, well, I'm just not
going to get his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same I did the same with Swerve.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was like, I'm seeing too much
like negative stuff and don't know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: parse what's, you know, what's real versus
what's, you know, someone having a
[SPEAKER_00]: monetary reason for saying the things
they're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was still at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not quite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't understand the value of clones
outside of like multiplication of plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like I didn't grasp that like,
oh, no, you can keep this exact one like
[SPEAKER_00]: it took after popping, you know,
continuing to pop seeds and taking clones
[SPEAKER_00]: from them and stuff like that just to just
to make more plants because I was doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: sea of green style like on a flood table
at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, after two years of doing
that, I started like, oh, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: that one was significantly better than
than the other ones, even though they're
[SPEAKER_00]: all very much, you know, they're probably
fucking S ones of whatever they had
[SPEAKER_00]: growing that fucked up that the pounds are
moved into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, then I started to realize,
oh, you know, like I can I can keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: good one, the quote unquote good one from
the bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I just I knew that I didn't know
enough back then to even try to to parse
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just stayed away, which then ended up
making me buy seeds from like places that
[SPEAKER_00]: were just straight up bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, buying the greenhouse,
the the circular packs where there's like
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking one seed of each thing in it,
you know, like not understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just not not getting it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they were the ones who didn't
have, you know, I thought that they had
[SPEAKER_00]: the bona fides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, of course, everyone knows about
fucking greenhouse seed, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I didn't understand the nuance to it
yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they also like when I think when
everybody starts off, you think like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, they sell one seed at a time like
that's cool, because like I got four
[SPEAKER_04]: hundred bucks, so I could get like one of
each seed, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you think it's like at least I'm
thinking like a tomato or something where
[SPEAKER_04]: you like you pop it in and you'll get
something good, like consistent every
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like like you said, I'm buying like
crop kings and are well, I love marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: dot coms or whatever that type of
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like it just yeah, it wasn't working
for me, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't excited about what I was growing
like at the end of the runs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was like, what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like once I really started to finish up
runs and stuff, I was just kind of now I
[SPEAKER_04]: will say there's been stuff like white
label seeds every once in a while you get
[SPEAKER_04]: a plant that was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, like that was rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, you fucking you just I know
back then I would go on Google and just be
[SPEAKER_04]: like best marijuana seeds or whatever,
you know, I wasn't like I'm like you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, man, these guys on these
forums and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only forums I really even paid
attention to was, like I said,
[SPEAKER_04]: for 20 Chan and bro, like they were on
another level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there were some of the people on
there kind of hateful and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I don't know, it was just wild
on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was also scared to like,
man, what if I get on here?
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is like, you know, back in time
in Kentucky, I was like, man, what if this
[SPEAKER_04]: is like all like going to get me in
trouble on here or something?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't fuck with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But so I watched a lot of the moot,
like I said, George Cervantes and all
[SPEAKER_04]: that, or Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always say George, but Jorge Cervantes
and all those dudes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would watch videos and YouTube came out
like perfect timing then, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there were starting to get people.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were certain people starting to try
to put shit on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember this video.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like some dude in like Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy didn't even talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just like or he wasn't talking with
somebody like dubbed over it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like him going through like a
grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, you know, it was the old setups
with like the HIDs and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I realized quickly like I'm not going
to be able to fucking use those because
[SPEAKER_04]: like in my spaces were always small.
[SPEAKER_04]: I burned my house down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have the money, didn't know
anything about that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I would start it off with
those fucking little shitty ass 6,500 CFL
[SPEAKER_04]: compact for essence and all that bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was what I started on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up getting back in in God,
it was like oh, seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was right after those LED UFOs came
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'd saw it in high times
because I was I was a very proud owner of
[SPEAKER_00]: a high time subscription.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I fucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, me and my friends hustled up the
money, seven hundred fucking dollars to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy one and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I thought it would this
will grow the entire fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, dude, back then they didn't have
there was like no, it was just blue and
[SPEAKER_00]: red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you would walk out, when I'd walk
out of the fucking closet, everything
[SPEAKER_00]: would be green and like melty like
mushrooms almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, like it was very
disorienting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say I kept looking at the it was
like the 150 watt or 100 watt high
[SPEAKER_04]: pressure sodium that I want to say that
Mars Hydro fucking made back then,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I remember like on eBay and stuff
you could like there were certain shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember going on eBay and was able to
find like grow tents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, back then I was just how I
stumbled on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember like reading on like 420
Chan and shit like that about HBS is a
[SPEAKER_04]: metal halides and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like I said, like the heat
restrictions and like my space,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to figure out how can I I kind
of put two and two together at a certain
[SPEAKER_04]: point, like for compact, for instance,
are not going to give me like dense nugs
[SPEAKER_04]: and shit like you were saying earlier
about wispy ass nugs and all shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I realized that at a certain point,
you know, through reading and doing
[SPEAKER_04]: research like, yeah, any better lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've seen that fucking little little
bitty like 100 watt, like I said,
[SPEAKER_04]: 100.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it had a ballast and all this
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was going to try to rig that up in
like a cabinet or some shit, but I never
[SPEAKER_04]: ended up doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I just ended up kind of falling
away for a long time and flipping packs,
[SPEAKER_04]: dude, for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wasn't until like fucking two
years, maybe before COVID hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That I started growing like seriously or
again, or fucking with it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for like two years, I just brought
like white labels and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I came across like CSI on the
fucking some panel thing he did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like a month or two later or
something like that, I fucking saw Matt
[SPEAKER_04]: and not so on the Matt show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was like a recording of maybe
like an IG show or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really remember what the episode
even was, but for a long time,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would watch, just watch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm like you, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were talking about earlier about not
trusting people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, is this dude for like monetary
shit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even in particular, but I was just
kind of skeptical of people already
[SPEAKER_04]: because of like I'd already been in
discourse and shit with other people with
[SPEAKER_04]: like other hobbies and shit I was into at
the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had like gotten like kind of ripped
off and like, I don't know, just a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: dumb drama and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like you, bro, from the far.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just kind of like watching for afar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I finally like, I don't remember
why, but I was like, man, I think it was
[SPEAKER_04]: my old lady.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was like, you know, why don't you join
their discord or whatever and just see
[SPEAKER_04]: what's going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I remember it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I joined this other dude's discord that I
don't want to name on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a fucking little dweeb, but I didn't
know anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was just trying to find a community
like we talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in the country, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wanting to connect with somebody or at
least chat about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Feel a little bit more comfortable as time
just went on, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I joined this discord for literally
like a day or two and they were weird in
[SPEAKER_04]: there, bro, like really fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kind of already felt like this is
us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I left that and then literally I wasn't
even going to try to join nothing again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she was like, why don't you just try a
different one one time?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I saw that Matt's was like paid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought to myself, like,
you know, you had to pay like five bucks
[SPEAKER_04]: or whatever to get in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, man, maybe that'll like be
enough to keep like the shit heads out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll actually be able to like get in
here and chill, you know, and that's kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of how I ended up joining the discord and
shit, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that, that experience before I
I'd been, you know, started listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched the Adam Dunn one quite a bit in
like 2016, 17, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after when COVID started, that's when
like everyone started, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: really podcast streaming just a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that started getting, you know,
much more online there because everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: else, I guess, the regular people started,
normies started.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, getting online more,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had put off listening to the
Breeders Syndicate because like I saw it
[SPEAKER_00]: on my Spotify list and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, no, because I'm not I'm still
not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was still unsure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, finally, I ran out of
all new material to listen to because I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: just be like cleaning the house,
fucking, you know, running errands,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that shit while listening to podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I finally was like, well, shit,
there's nothing else to listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was hooked fucking right
away because things made sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like to where I was like,
man, I wonder if this is why.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not I still don't know shit,
you know, like and that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was it sucks because, you know,
I kind of like started to put together
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, oh, man, all this fucking
time I've wasted, like learning stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't real, you know, like learning the
marketing, essentially, which is cool and
[SPEAKER_00]: all, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like in terms of growing, you end up
not having a good grasp of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have good if you don't have good
like reference points.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're it's all fucking useless
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all just random.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was when I started like,
oh, man, you know, like, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me fucking let me check this stuff out
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I and I started popping, you know,
like asking questions because I ran out of
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the past episodes and saw that it's
on IG live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started that's actually what made me
start using Instagram was going to watch
[SPEAKER_00]: the episodes and just like trying to
trying to learn, participate and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I got so lucky, dude, because
like, yeah, I bought a bunch of white
[SPEAKER_04]: labels and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I wouldn't even say a bunch
because at the time I had like 110.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm popping and I was doing like you
were doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm growing and like I think at the time,
like seven gallon fucking fabric pots,
[SPEAKER_04]: like four plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're getting big, you know,
and not to take my own horn or nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like those first few harvest that I
did, I'm not saying I never had a bad one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've definitely had bad harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a bad one.
[SPEAKER_04]: My last harvest was terrible just because
of fucking thrips and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But and my dad being sick and shit,
I just like I was my headspace was not,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I've talked to you about this
before, but my dad, I thought he's about
[SPEAKER_04]: to pass away and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going through a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just like my grow and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't give a fuck about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I trimmed it down to basically whatever
was in flower at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I finished it up and I brought indoor
stuff or outdoor shit in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lesson learned there, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did some of my trimming up inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then literally like two or three weeks
later, I got thrips in the in my garden,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only thing I could think of
because I've been, you know, I've been
[SPEAKER_04]: growing for a good time, a good,
good while.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the first time I've ever had a
real pest problem other than like some
[SPEAKER_04]: hats or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think I got lucky, dude,
by something about CSI, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I watched him on a panel one day,
because I was looking for information,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I felt like I was tapped out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like I started growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, and I like kind of was just doing
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew I knew how to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I fucked around as a kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like I went much to it,
like put the seeds in the ground,
[SPEAKER_04]: water them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, like every new grower,
I'm over watering my shit, doing stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know, not doing the greatest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I watch I'm looking for information.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm more on how to grow better.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also was curious about genetics
because what really got me into this whole
[SPEAKER_04]: journey to like kind of look for guys like
y'all and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was actually Granddaddy Perp and people
shit on me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like that fucking weed was the first
some of the best, I guess, the first good
[SPEAKER_04]: weed I had ever really had, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was like right out of high
school.
[SPEAKER_04]: That particular weed was so good at its
time for me that for up to like up to the
[SPEAKER_04]: point I met my buddy's dad, the dude I was
recording music with, I hadn't seen weed
[SPEAKER_04]: like that, basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and I'd seen that GDP like four or five
times throughout the throughout my time
[SPEAKER_04]: doing what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then even the dude I end up fucking
with for like 10 years, he ended up
[SPEAKER_04]: getting that same GDP.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like that I wanted to experience that
again, because it's like we talk about it
[SPEAKER_04]: on the show or Matt does and in the
discord, like sometimes you smoke shit
[SPEAKER_04]: back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not what you really think it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe you just your memory of it was
terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like I feel like I'm so familiar with
that because I smoked it so many times
[SPEAKER_04]: over the years, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was buying like, whenever that came,
dude, I would get a pound of it,
[SPEAKER_04]: bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said before, I would normally
fuck with like QP's half pounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I see when that came,
I would get a pound of it so I could have
[SPEAKER_04]: it and I could smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can just remember it and I will
always remember it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always look the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always smell the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always smoke the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of those few weeds you could smoke at
the time for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And mind you, I'm smoking all day long.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my job, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like every time somebody buys a bag,
you want to smoke a blunt?
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course I want to smoke a blunt with
you, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm playing video games and Super
Smash Bros and selling fucking half
[SPEAKER_04]: quarters and quarters and zips all day.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that GDP sent me on that mission,
bro, because I had popped some from I love
[SPEAKER_04]: growing marijuana dot com dot com.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was fucking like not even close,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not even close.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it made me wonder like, you know,
what is going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, like I started looking for that,
like using that term.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like GDP actually searching for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I came across the fucking kin stuff and
something about all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just like, dude, this don't feel
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like in the video with like these
rapper dudes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I just was like really confused
by all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The kin was an S.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always forget his last name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, dude, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I started watching them panels with
CSI.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know how he is.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's real humble.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way he talks about shit,
I don't feel like he was trying to sell me
[SPEAKER_04]: something.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like the first person I had seen
that was like, man, I feel like he's and
[SPEAKER_04]: he's talking about how he's been doing it
in his family for, you know, whatever was
[SPEAKER_04]: 30, 40 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, if anybody fucking knows
this guy knows.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I go and look at his website,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, oh, man, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a scam day right here,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought the same fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, no, I'm not getting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way he's got all of these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at this fucking website.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cash only.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sitting here thinking like,
what the fuck, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: And at this point, it's been like it just
like opened up medical in like Colorado or
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think like Michigan was coming up or
like, I don't know, somewhere in between
[SPEAKER_04]: all this shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's another reason why I was back
in it, too, because these places were
[SPEAKER_04]: going to wreck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was going to visit them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went out to Colorado and I went out to
Michigan, a couple of different places
[SPEAKER_04]: over the years of stuff has come online.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always thought it was so funny,
dude, that the black market weed that I
[SPEAKER_04]: brought with me to get me there was often
better than the shit I was getting from
[SPEAKER_04]: some of these places.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, the experience was still
cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the time, some of those places
would have like four or five strains or
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivars or fucking call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it just wasn't it wasn't what I
was expecting out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when I went to Colorado, that was
just a dope trip in general, because it
[SPEAKER_04]: was beautiful, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we went and did like a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went to like Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went to like a couple of other other
spots.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went to this like rock and mineral show
that they have this big massive one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was cool because I'm you know,
I'm getting high legally pretty much
[SPEAKER_04]: walking around.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like the first the experience of
like going somewhere and not being like
[SPEAKER_04]: pursued or feel like you have to be
careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like look over your shoulder was like
a breath of fresh air.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as time has went on over the years,
when I got the opportunity to move up here
[SPEAKER_04]: to Michigan, bro, and just do shit legally
and not worry, I took it, bro,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I was like, man, like I made it
for so many like that time I got held up,
[SPEAKER_04]: bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Rob, that was like my only time like I
would never have any other problems,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, getting caught up or anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I looked at it that is like a sign.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I met her years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, you know, I got out of doing all
that bullshit years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't have a need for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, man, like, you know,
as years went on the market, the black in
[SPEAKER_04]: black market, even it's tanked.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like the way I had operated for
years like back then was having the best
[SPEAKER_04]: of the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once everybody had access and even the
dude I was talking about for like 10
[SPEAKER_04]: years, eventually even he had like all
cookies, all, you know, gelatos,
[SPEAKER_04]: all the shit like it was all everybody had
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like, basically my advantage in
my market was gone because everybody else
[SPEAKER_04]: had had the same exact shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and you see it, you see the
disappointment in my I saw the
[SPEAKER_04]: disappointment in the quality with even my
customers because like these are all the
[SPEAKER_04]: same channels that I'm getting the same
shit from right that I have for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're complaining that it's not
getting high or like it's bunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's of course, it's like runs or some
skittles or whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever it was, you know, and who knows
if that's what it actually was.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, it got to the point where I
wasn't even having fun anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wasn't easy anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, you could still get,
I don't know, I would say probably 150
[SPEAKER_04]: close to 200, depending on what you got.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then that norm is probably like 75 to
120 25 for a zip in Kentucky now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's like, basically, you're getting
Oreos or lava cakes or shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's pretty much how it is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's fucking pitiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, you know, it's like,
God damn, I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I still keep in touch with
people and and watch what's going on and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fuck, the games just gotten so fucking
diluted.
[SPEAKER_00]: To where now it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure there was like, there was
that to a degree back in the day of people
[SPEAKER_00]: just shopping based on price points.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't I don't know how it was out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But out here, we had like a tier system,
basically, where it was either swag,
[SPEAKER_00]: baby drill or drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like within those three tiers,
the price can change a little bit up or
[SPEAKER_00]: down, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not a oh, this is this is more
fire than the last batch, every single
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't as many people pretending to
have better weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the weed he had was like
literally you got to imagine, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm in a small town of maybe 15000
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in that town for years, the Reggie
trade was dominated by cartels and they
[SPEAKER_04]: would basically distribute between two
guys, two main guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those guys would distribute to the
younger guys and basically in the projects
[SPEAKER_04]: and government housing and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those were the dealers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, with his weed was just so
much better, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, there was a tier system
kind of for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say this is before I met him.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was more like people started
calling shit like ten dollar a gram,
[SPEAKER_04]: but or ten, but or they would say,
oh, this shit's fifteen dollars a gram or
[SPEAKER_04]: fifteen a gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they would say, hey, hey, I got
Reggie.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got shit that's like ten dollars and I
got shows like fifteen.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was only like for like a year or
two.
[SPEAKER_04]: At a certain point, I remember this one
dude I started fucking with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I met at this factory while I was working
and he was getting shit like I want to say
[SPEAKER_04]: it was like Fruity Pebbles, like Blue
Dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't really remember the other names
other than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just remember those two in particular.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was always something different each
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was just like people started
calling that like Drow or Kush or like it
[SPEAKER_04]: was a lot of stupid little names.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that was only like a year or two
where they had like that tier system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it got to a point where it was
just like twenty dollars a gram,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there were still a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those people I was telling you about the
distributed to everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were still trying to pass their shit
off, though, is like twenty dollars a gram
[SPEAKER_04]: type or three, four hundred dollars an
ounce type shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it wasn't really worth that,
especially when I brought when started
[SPEAKER_04]: hooking me up with all this shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a whole different level
because he had money.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he worked a really good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he hustled.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had money, money.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: So he was trying to get the best shit,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was getting weight and he was
getting like it wasn't just like it was
[SPEAKER_04]: the first time I went to a dude that was
like it wasn't just one thing of each like
[SPEAKER_04]: different price point.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, yo, like this is all this
price and I have all these varieties that
[SPEAKER_04]: you can choose from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You mean like basically any amount I could
probably ever want, you know, and yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: so there wasn't really much of a tier
system other than like I was saying ten
[SPEAKER_04]: bud or 15 a bud or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after a while, everyone was just
trying to do 20 a gram because,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, grabbing it out, dude,
fucking sucked.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Tom Tom was because I could I
don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you're in a place where it's
illegal still, you don't want traffic like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like you're charging people for,
you know, and the more you buy,
[SPEAKER_04]: you get the discount, obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I mean, I would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's that's gone away,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I remember when man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a friend who was getting in,
you know, he he was the broker,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting in very large quantities,
at least, you know, for for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like me and the rest of my
friends would fucking boom, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: split off with six piece for you,
eight for you, two for you, just what we
[SPEAKER_00]: have for our market.
And.
[SPEAKER_00]: That when he started in order to to gain
market capture, he did the same price,
[SPEAKER_00]: although it's like, well, fuck,
why would I buy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I buy anything more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, you know, my fucking why would I buy
10 pounds when it's the same price as if I
[SPEAKER_00]: buy one pound, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck, does it matter?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's my do was to like you only
got the discount, bro, if you went up to
[SPEAKER_04]: the P. And I never did the P that often
because like my my customer base,
[SPEAKER_04]: they were kind of picky.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, my whole business model
was having the best shit and variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I didn't want to get stuck with I
mean, I can work to a P in a week pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like I I try to avoid people that
wanted to wait because I always thought to
[SPEAKER_04]: myself like those are the motherfuckers
that are going to like try to get you or
[SPEAKER_04]: tell on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I really focus on like like more
like your mom and dad type crowd that got
[SPEAKER_04]: a job.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you know, I stayed away from
older people or younger, real young dudes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I stayed away from other dealers for
the most part, the best I could,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like I got held up because I had
because I decided to have a partner.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my partner is basically why I got got
in my sticky situation at first time,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, or the that that time or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was just like, after that,
after that, I'm like, I'm not trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: chill with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, my dude, basically, it was like
350 zip or 400 or whatever type shit all
[SPEAKER_04]: the way up to where you get a QP,
you get a discount, then you get a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit of a discount to HP and then you get a
discount to P. And that was it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, even if you bought more than one
P, you ain't going to discount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that was the problem is, is this
dude, there was no like he would be
[SPEAKER_00]: selling QPs to at the same the same
breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, well, fuck me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kills the secondary market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because who do you think I'm selling shit
to?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like that was going to be my my
Q customer that I would make, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 bucks off of or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I don't got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that's just that's standard
fucking practice out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I would know, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was that's just like sit all behind
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll catch up with when I went down to
Kentucky and that's when I go and hung and
[SPEAKER_04]: he's still up to his old chick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I mean, I could get you obviously
extremely cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: I smoked some of their shit and,
you know, it literally was like lava cake
[SPEAKER_04]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just because I didn't really bring
any weed with me because I got to go down
[SPEAKER_04]: to Indiana, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I go down there and I'm just like,
they're everywhere, bro, in Indiana,
[SPEAKER_04]: like on this highway with laser speed
checks, all that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like I usually bring like maybe
like a half quarter with me and,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, or sometimes not even anything
just because I'm like, bro, it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's not worth getting pulled
over to just for some weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I don't when I was younger,
you know, we're talking about getting
[SPEAKER_04]: wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was younger.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now I'm older and got, you know,
an old lady.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't do that kind of shit no more,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not worth my time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, my dude was like that,
too, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I can't knock it, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he paid my bills for years,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and eventually, you know, as time went
on, you know, I got better deals than
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was really taking good care of me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, but you know, I always appreciate
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that shit was fun, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed it sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, at the same time, being able to
grow, maybe we could dial it in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of forgot we're even on a podcast,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked a few times and we've known
each other for a couple of years now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I almost forgot we're on even doing a
podcast, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, maybe we could talk about like
what's going on now, like currently and
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of highlight the discord and maybe
some stuff you're growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now and talk about some of the guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I am right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently smoking some garbage cloud,
which is shoreline by Santa Cruz Blue
[SPEAKER_00]: Dream from pack at Santa Cruz Goat Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from my second run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to do a third with three
of the clones because I still can't pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely what I was hoping for,
like more than I could have asked for out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that pack, honestly.
[SPEAKER_04]: What were the garbage clouds again for
people on the cross for people who maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: not know anything about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoreline by Santa Cruz Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think maybe you said that,
but I'm fucking big.
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it's fucking killer, killer,
killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: What what's the like what kind of flavors
are you getting on it in the in the smoke?
[SPEAKER_04]: How's the smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in pretty much all of them,
they had very good representations of both
[SPEAKER_00]: parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that first that first run of them,
I could only cut out two just due to and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not because they weren't good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because they weren't as potent as the
other five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, really good expressions from
both parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am I'm liking the shoreline leaners.
[SPEAKER_00]: More and that may be because I am a bit
biased when it comes to that cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that that's like a.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pretty pivotal cut for like my
development as a smoker, like that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: got me to, you know, make the switch from
not smoking swag anymore and only buying,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it might be that,
but I tend to like the shoreline leaners
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the potency on them is fucking
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple where the blueberry from
the blue dream pops through and like
[SPEAKER_00]: blends in with the nasty, funky fucking
rankness ashore that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really fucking nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's awesome, dude, I actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I got one in reach, well, Matt says we
can't show plants, I guess, because the
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube's I was going to pull one out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I literally got got sleep disturbance.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are all about goat farm,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: The same same guy from the discord.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got garbage cloud, Kim dreams,
Terp Queen and.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the other one, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: All my tags are a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't see them from here, but anyways,
I got a fourth one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, yeah, I got I got that one going,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a full pack and all of them have
made it so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got full packs of well, yeah,
got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to you're going to like that
one quite a fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it's nasty and it's strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I gave one of the weak ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: To to a friend and he was like,
oh, my fucking God, this is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like breaking my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I let him know,
like, dude, that's not that's not even a
[SPEAKER_00]: good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try this one and gave him gave him the
number six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It like has my fucking ears raking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I I'm excited about South Coast H&L.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got the East Coast Hour Diesel times
the Southern Gothic, which is Irene,
[SPEAKER_04]: the Southern Gothics, the Irene to the
Appiah, I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, man, I'm pumped for this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I also got, dude, H&L is taking
such good care of me, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: He ended up sending me some super silver
Hayes F5s.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to run some of that shit
outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: But another one, he ended up sending me
another pack of the Kim dog BX,
[SPEAKER_04]: bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so fucking hype for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, yeah, dude, I got some Crongel
stuff going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt's Blue Sour going.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what else I got going on a lot of
Matt Elite stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple of dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some dogs going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got some of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in the flower tent right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got one or two flower right now and I
got another two that I just up potted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you take clones?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: But listen, I have taken clones of other
shit already.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got two clone things up here filled up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I literally need to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like now I just I had a Madjag episode
with Matt yesterday and then I was
[SPEAKER_04]: planning to do locals episode like an hour
or two after it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he had to work a little bit over.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then obviously, Friday, I had the show
with Matt to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I've just had a lot of shit to
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And literally, I'm not kidding you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to go up flights of stairs and
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have spent probably a day and a half
up potting like two or three tents because
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to clean them up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took them downstairs, cleaned them up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously, I've been trying to like do
my soil shit outside or just downstairs or
[SPEAKER_04]: a different place, obviously, just to keep
the you know, the air clean as possible
[SPEAKER_04]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I mean, you mix up your soil and
shit, bro, in your room with your grow
[SPEAKER_04]: plants and shit or with your grow room.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got fucking shit going airborne and
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So especially like if it's real dry,
some of that Fox farm shit comes a little
[SPEAKER_04]: dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get dust in the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, so I it's literally taken me like
two days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, I got the I've been having
to write up questions for interviews.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've also been doing stuff for just
different stuff for the syndicate,
[SPEAKER_04]: bro, the discord and just doing other
shit, trying to stay busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course, I got my real life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a bunch of animals and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, man, I got skank dogs going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Need to take clones of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also have I actually just bought two
more packs of them from Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only two packs left.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you said you were wanting to get a
pack, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You better fucking get them.
[SPEAKER_04]: After that episode, people started buying
them again with with Rob.
[SPEAKER_04]: If if if people don't know what we're
talking about, go check out Matt's Matthew
[SPEAKER_04]: Wright's last episode on the Breeders
Syndicate, the main show from,
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it would be last Friday's episode
with C.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drip Rob, where he talks about the skank
dog and the SS H.
[SPEAKER_04]: S.
[SPEAKER_04]: D.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I forget, I think HD, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, this the super silver hay,
super silver hay's cross he's got.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's got a little he also he's got
other episodes with C.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drip Rob that you can go watch from like a
while back.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, man, I'm doing the skank dogs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I got just random shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the stuff from the grow contest
going as well from Pac as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know what those are,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, man, I'm rocking, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I even got some auto flowers going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I saw you added some of those to
the for the Patreon packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, I put I put I think like 10 or
20 packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like 60 people that get packs from
the Patreon or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I put like 10 or 20 of them there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if people want to throw them in
the garbage, that's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it don't matter to me now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're literally just going to sit
around and rot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm running some of those myself,
like just to check them out right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, people want to throw them
outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: But speaking of seeds, have you made any
seeds yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not intentionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I'm a I like good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's why I do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, it keeps me like mentally and
physically engaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, like, you know, I do this for
for the flower, not, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is enough fucking ridiculously good
things that I want to check out from these
[SPEAKER_00]: guys who have who've been holding on to
these clones for a long time and been
[SPEAKER_00]: working stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and like, especially now that
I've been able over the past couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: years to like, watch them do it,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it there's enough fire out there
for me just to I'm cool with just popping
[SPEAKER_00]: packs from people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to I might end up doing like an
F2 on this garbage cloud to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe if I can find something that is
better than than two of the parents,
[SPEAKER_00]: like two of the of the clones that I
really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not it's not all of any seed
making anything that I'm ever going to end
[SPEAKER_00]: up doing is just to just to find a cool
cut in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I I make my money elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to I'm not trying to I'm not
trying to do that kind of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't have I don't I don't see
myself as having like the space really,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be dealing with all of that while I'm
and still be able to like go through the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that I want to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's, that's like, that's where
my strength is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just being used to see of green
growing from when I was, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the flood table grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I do now to look through
like my space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: My space probably seems much bigger than
it is whenever I talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because like the amount of stuff that
I pop and the stuff that like I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: through each time I flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just because I keep I keep stuff
small and I do denser planting with it
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm trying to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to find the good one that I can
dedicate the whole space to just growing
[SPEAKER_00]: that one, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I get you, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I I like I like to make seeds,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: For one, I enjoy the process of it in
general.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, too, as I've gotten more involved
with Breeders Syndicate, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the guys in there, a lot of like
Matt's work and a few of the other guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially H&L, he has like most of his
shit are all regs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I really love this shit,
dude, like whether it's a female or a male
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, I treat them the same for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put it grown in the same pots and stuff,
unless I recognize one really early.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I'll take a male and grow it in
a smaller pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like a lot of times I'm wasting some
materials, probably inputs that probably
[SPEAKER_04]: we don't need.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I got it there already and they're
handy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like for me, I got space so I can move
it off to another place or take it
[SPEAKER_04]: outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the time they're dumping,
you know, you only need them for a few
[SPEAKER_04]: days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Collect a little bit of pollen and then
you dust a little bit just here and there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for me, like I have a seed
addiction, bro, like I for a solid year
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I first joined the Discord, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was buying like seeds like every fucking
week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, dude, like crazy amounts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know we all go through that shit,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like for me, I found it's like I just
dust a little bit and just I know like I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: not I don't sell weeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like finding a seed or two here or
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like for me, it's not really like a
problem or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't and I don't mind it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for me, I like it too, because it's
it's already there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I already got to usually have multiple
males on on on hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any expectation from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also being a part of the
community, bro, so many people give me
[SPEAKER_04]: free shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in the beginning, I was so many
people were giving me free seeds and shit
[SPEAKER_04]: that I felt weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so weird about that, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's like the country,
country in me or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like where I'm from, like nobody has
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like when you when someone gives
you something, it means a lot because
[SPEAKER_04]: they're probably giving up something that
they actually probably need to give you or
[SPEAKER_04]: need themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're giving it to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like that's just how we were raised.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like if somebody does something for
you, I don't like feeling like I owe
[SPEAKER_04]: anybody anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, like I don't want to send
people weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like kind of sketch.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, like sending some seeds of what
some chuck or whatever I did, if they
[SPEAKER_04]: don't pop it like whatever, like I don't
give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's just something to share.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, yeah, it's like almost like
currency for me in a way like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: where it's like, you know, and to another
thing, which has been awesome,
[SPEAKER_04]: is like Matt does the 50 tier where he's
where he gives like seeds out like a pack
[SPEAKER_04]: a month, quarterly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's been there's been times where
like maybe he did because that's all like
[SPEAKER_04]: donations and stuff from like the guys
basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like being able to like contribute to
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a mini dream for me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like just hanging out, like going through
the processes of like taking a plant that
[SPEAKER_04]: you like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even if you don't really know a whole
lot, like just smashing them together and
[SPEAKER_04]: just like for me put like last year,
for example, I took the I'm slowly getting
[SPEAKER_04]: through shit off chucked.
[SPEAKER_04]: So last year I ran the I think it was
Space Invaders, Creamy Punch, I guess,
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt selection, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Creamy Punch had chucked some Appy
F3 pollen, male pollen a couple of years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was like right when I joined the
discord and I was trying to learn about
[SPEAKER_04]: like breeding and seeds and all that shit,
because that's what I was interested,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was chucked some Appys onto like a
bunch of shit from the discord,
[SPEAKER_04]: like Pox ATW or his train wreck S1s,
the Triangle Choke and a couple of other
[SPEAKER_04]: ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: But long story short, I ran the Triangle
Choke across the Appalachia F3 and then I
[SPEAKER_04]: ran the Creamy Punch across to the
Appalachia F3 outdoors last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have a jar of it sitting on the
floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just being able to try those out was
awesome, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I found is like that weed was
just as good as like any other fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: weed I had ran, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was outdoor, low inputs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't do soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: I barely gave it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even really feed them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave some cow mag.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was my first year being in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to try just straight into soil
and see what would happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even like that, I still got a good
harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that Triangle Choke cross,
it molded like a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything I had that was purple molded out,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: PM all over it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was like six foot tall,
super purple, dank.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: The structure was nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smelled as good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was dank.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I couldn't smoke it or
didn't want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I ended up throwing it out the
backyard.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, dude, just being able to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really into Pokemon and the shit
growing up, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, I know it sounds dumb as fuck,
but like in that game, you could get like
[SPEAKER_04]: shiny stuff and hunt and like breed stuff
and like get crosses of stuff and
[SPEAKER_04]: something about that, like the unknown.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, my point is, is I enjoy like the
unknowns or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like for like the stuff I've chucked
before, I'm not proud about or think
[SPEAKER_04]: they're cool really or anything like that
at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am literally just now thinking to myself
like, damn, the scum.
[SPEAKER_04]: Funk to hug mixed in with like any number
of these other things that I've ran from
[SPEAKER_04]: like H&L or whatever might be awesome
because it's like for me, I like dank,
[SPEAKER_04]: like gassy fermentation like shit,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want funk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want like what you were saying with the
shoreline.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't tried shoreline.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe that's the answer, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, the these here in particular,
bro, from H&L, the Kim Dog BX,
[SPEAKER_04]: bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man, raunchy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I'm not good at this kind of
talk or description of this kind of stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it was just raunchiness, dude,
like fermentation, not like fruity or
[SPEAKER_04]: nothing, just like raw raunchiness,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: And almost like some of the shit that I
grew from or some of it almost kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: smelled like, I don't know, being where
you're from, maybe you visited the Gulf
[SPEAKER_04]: and like you smell there's like kind of
this almost like rotten seaweed smell
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes, especially in the mornings when
the tide comes in, kind of smell like
[SPEAKER_04]: that, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just right up my alley,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I could get something like that in a
chuck, bro, and not have to like fork out
[SPEAKER_04]: because, you know, bro, if you want to
find anything good, most likely you need
[SPEAKER_04]: to pop a couple packs and do that shit
adds up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm a little seed addict.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't keep up with purchasing,
you know, $100 packs every week.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, it's as simple as that saving
money and yeah, just having something to
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm ADHD, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like the more should I keep myself
doing and busy, the better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And something that I found really
interesting was fucking around with the
[SPEAKER_04]: autos, bro, is like pollinating,
like, I don't know the scientific
[SPEAKER_04]: terminology, but it's used for the stuff,
first signs of like your sex and stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially like on your females,
you get that first white hair that comes
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my point is I was able to pollinate
those specific things with one seed,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was able to pollinate the actual
buds with a different pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, obviously if you're selling
seeds or, you know, if you're worried
[SPEAKER_04]: about contamination, that's fucking
retarded.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the way I did it was I had Matt's
Blueberry IX, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: A male.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hit it to Blueberry IX females.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had some Blueberry autos outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I took some pollen and I dusted those
little, just those little preflowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it took, and then like literally a
week later, I had a male auto of some
[SPEAKER_04]: kind, I forget, like some kind of,
it doesn't matter, but I hit that to the
[SPEAKER_04]: actual main buds as they start to fully
come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just now going through those to
see if they actually, if it worked,
[SPEAKER_04]: because, you know, I'm curious if you
could do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't think you could do that or
want to do that with like your traditional
[SPEAKER_04]: plants, but that was just something I
thought that was really cool about the
[SPEAKER_04]: autos in particular was just being able
to, like for my own personal stash,
[SPEAKER_04]: just I was able to do multiple hits to it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was neat about that is like when
I run the ones that I think are frost to a
[SPEAKER_04]: non-auto, obviously if they don't auto
flower, then it worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then obviously the ones that I cross
to the bud, the auto to auto, when they
[SPEAKER_04]: start to flower within, you know,
three or four weeks, I know they're
[SPEAKER_04]: actually auto.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's pretty easy to determine,
you know, which one wasn't or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I don't know, just a fun experiment I
like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so to be clear, I probably am
going to do like seed projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's going to be, you know,
just for me to, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to like look at stuff also,
I'm going through all these shoreline
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids and I'm probably in a couple of
years going to try and reverse shore back
[SPEAKER_00]: onto those keepers just so that,
so I have a, you know, in case something
[SPEAKER_00]: happens, I have a little bit of a seed
backup to be able to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pop out what I like about shoreline again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was either Farmer Dan or Kush
the Giant that said, and this was on a
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast with Matt, that he said he wished
he had, you know, a lot of those guys
[SPEAKER_04]: operate with clones out there only.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said that he wished he had just
chucked something over the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget what particular plant he was
talking about, but he said he wished he
[SPEAKER_04]: had chucked something over the years
because he ended up losing that cut and
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't have any seeds of any kind of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's important to say for
people who are watching, like just because
[SPEAKER_04]: you cross two plants together,
don't mean you're exactly going to get a
[SPEAKER_04]: representation of like a particular plant
in there, but you know, there's the odds
[SPEAKER_04]: that you can find enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, for example, when I crossed the
Creamy Punch to the Appalachia F3s,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was interesting because I could see the
Appalachia that I used to do the original
[SPEAKER_04]: pollination was a really tropical one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had a little bit of mango, like two or
three months into the cure, but not much
[SPEAKER_04]: mango at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was more like this real tropical-y,
like it reminded me of a tropical-y kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of drink.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that Creamy Punch kind of like really
just like personified that and brought it
[SPEAKER_04]: out and made it a little bit more smooth.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, you can definitely,
that being said, you definitely can get
[SPEAKER_04]: some sort of idea from some stuff
sometimes, but yeah, I mean, like I know a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of people will buy S1s and I've done
this myself thinking like, oh man,
[SPEAKER_04]: like this is like getting the cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we talked about this in the
Discord and it's not always the case,
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think- Yeah, we actually,
we just talked about this today in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I feel you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, you know, that was what I was
telling that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't necessarily want an exact carbon
copy, even if, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, it is not likely with,
you know, S1s, depending on what the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual clone being like reversed onto
itself is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's going to, it's rejumbled,
it reshuffles everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's, if it's not very homogenous,
you're not going to get, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: homogenous results.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some stuff, obviously you,
I mean, fuck those 91 S1s where it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like growing just clones of each other,
the whole fucking run.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I don't, even if that were,
if every clone that you, if every time you
[SPEAKER_00]: made S1s, it was, you know, perfect in
line with how the mom was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not necessarily what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause everything has its drawback.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how good it is, you just,
you know, there's only so much room in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cup and very few things, like very few,
just check every box.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'd much prefer is, it's something
that has a representation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression that I like, but with
improvements on, you know, whatever else
[SPEAKER_00]: is wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever failing it has, you know,
if I, I'm, I'm much more excited about,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, that's what I, that's what I love
about that weed, but in a better form.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can, I understand that completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, I've gone through stages
where I hate keeping cuts of anything,
[SPEAKER_04]: bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really enjoy like that unknown of
popping seeds, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm not like, has there been plants
that I want an expression, a certain
[SPEAKER_04]: expression that the mom or whatever,
you know, whatever that I want to see?
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like sometimes like that's the fun
part.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fun part of popping some of these
crosses that some of these guys make is
[SPEAKER_04]: like, for example, the P Hayes for,
you know, scenes P Hayes is a sweet P
[SPEAKER_04]: times Band-Aid Hayes number seven,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's one of our local from our
discord, one of the guys selections,
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, or a cross he made something that
I enjoyed about running those was the
[SPEAKER_04]: finding the ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a big, the Hayes is that I've
tried.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's certain ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's certain things about Hayes I just
don't like, mainly like the flavor,
[SPEAKER_04]: the profiles and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Hayes, obviously I enjoy growing them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I say, I don't know if I would,
if I had the right setup, I would enjoy
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of my tents are not set up for Hayes
or growing Hayes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The AM Hayes that I grew, which I didn't
finish just because of my, that was some
[SPEAKER_04]: shit that I threw with when dad was going
through all this shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those what blew my fucking mind when you
were talking about like the way plants are
[SPEAKER_04]: and the way they express and the negatives
and drawbacks, something that blew my mind
[SPEAKER_04]: about those AM Hayes was how they didn't
like light.
[SPEAKER_04]: They literally the one and a couple of the
other guys noticed this too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to take credit for the one
knowing that I just, they told me like,
[SPEAKER_04]: yo, they don't like light like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, I want to trash it and
test stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you know, I like to,
I like to think that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to trash it and see it for myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that I don't believe people,
but sure enough, put them directly,
[SPEAKER_04]: the ones directly under the center of the
light started to kind of just not really
[SPEAKER_04]: like look terrible, but just a little
yellowed up and kind of just, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: did some droopy shit and the ones on the
sides were perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I moved, I switched some stuff around
and moved those to all the edges of the
[SPEAKER_04]: tent and sure enough, they perked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So something about like that blew my mind
that it was like, okay, now not only do I
[SPEAKER_04]: have to like flower this longer flowering
variety plant out in a tent that sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I have to like worry about the,
how much the light it gets and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me, I'm popping different shit and
different tents.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm never really running.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm running full packs a lot of
times, but sometimes like, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have two of each, like right now
I've got a full pack of skank dogs,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is six seeds gone, but I have them
at different stages based on how fast one
[SPEAKER_04]: grew or how slow one grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I try to keep plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do train to a certain point,
but you know, as I've gotten more involved
[SPEAKER_04]: in more plants, it's harder to do all that
shit or I don't have all the time in the
[SPEAKER_04]: world to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a real life.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I try to just do it based on yeah,
how tall they grow and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what were we getting at with this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, drawbacks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, just seeing that kind of blew my
fucking mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it was like, yeah, it's negatives
that I never would have thought.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have thought this fucking sativa
would have loved son.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't know where all the
shit's from and don't pretend to,
[SPEAKER_04]: but in my mind, I'm thinking this plant's
going to love like light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It hated it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of funny like that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to turn down the light on,
on the P Hayes pack that I have going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they same thing they started like,
they started getting pretty stressed out
[SPEAKER_00]: from just, and it wasn't, it's,
I didn't even like crank it up higher or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was just what I normally
would put it at for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: their distance from the lion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw that too on my batch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like a terrible grower because
I've seen other guys grow the P Hayes and
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just, well, I had thrips and like I
said, I was had a lot of shit going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually, when those were
transplanted, she transplanted them for me
[SPEAKER_04]: while I was out of town.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I'm not saying she fucked them
up or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying it's not the most ideal
situations.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was like three or four things going
on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I also saw that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to dial a lot of shit back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also made the mistake of running them.
[SPEAKER_04]: She put them in two, two gallon pots
instead of like three or five gallon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that kind of fucked me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause at the time I wasn't really leaning
into a lot of like, I wasn't really
[SPEAKER_04]: feeding a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really kind of relying on like,
what was in, you know, the, the soil and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: These runs, I'm doing the Canaterra dude
and I'm fucking loving him, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I could show you some of this shit,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so happy with everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I've just surrendered to it and I'm
doing exactly what they call for,
[SPEAKER_04]: like other, everything to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not, not everything in their line,
but I'm literally just doing the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the, the Tana Flora's and the Tana or the
Vegas and the Flora's or whatever it's
[SPEAKER_04]: called.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm doing some cow mags from
recharge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was something else, some
mosquito dunks and something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think I'd say it actually,
but yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm loving it, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm running an ocean though still.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for like the first few weeks,
I'm, I'm, you know, when I up pot,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really like pumping them that
hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and right now I'm kind of,
I'm writing like five, 600 PPMs,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe some a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I got a couple of different
stages.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like my seedlings and things like that,
I'm like two, two, 300 somewhere in that
[SPEAKER_04]: area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a little bit more by the time I had
some cow mag in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, man, it's, it's great,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more expensive and I know you can get
stuff for a better price.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to experiment with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was, this happened to be the time I
was going to experiment with the Canada,
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the Canada products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And dude, I fucking love them,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they're, I've messed with bio biz a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't fucking like that, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just, it burned a lot of my plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a lot of those shit they call
for a certain amount and it's always way
[SPEAKER_04]: over, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It fucks my shit up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, I think that's why I had a
little bit of trouble with Canada in the
[SPEAKER_04]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I was, I'm used to shit burning.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really didn't surrender to,
or didn't really like do what they were
[SPEAKER_04]: recommending.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was, you know, that golden rule going
half.
[SPEAKER_04]: And didn't really, wasn't really excited
about what I was seeing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was having some issues with one of
the blue sours.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just like, yeah, I could tell it was
hungry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like, I was like, dude, I looked it
up on their little chart and they were
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know, add whatever it was at the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like 50 milliliters of the Vegas or
whatever the grow part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I did, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And literally like within like six hours,
that motherfucker was like green eating
[SPEAKER_04]: back up and like perked up and I was like,
fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for like a week straight, I just
followed their regimen, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, it feels kind of, I feel like a
goober kind of cause like normally like
[SPEAKER_04]: the way I would do it in the past would
just kind of just operate not completely
[SPEAKER_04]: off visuals, but you know, you grow for a
while and use the same pot size.
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of have an understanding of when
your plants are needing food, or at least
[SPEAKER_04]: the way I was growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would kind of operate in that way of
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like, I would maybe top dress or
I would lean in on bottles, especially
[SPEAKER_04]: during flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like doing it this way, that's been
interesting cause I've tested out like
[SPEAKER_04]: freshly transplanted shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, literally, I forget the bars,
Bittersweet recommended the bar lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're little clone lights, little bars,
four footers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget the brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it doesn't really matter,
but I got them under that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And bro, I gave them 200 PPMs of the can
of stuff and some, and Cal Mag,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're like a week and a half old
that they haven't burnt.
[SPEAKER_04]: They love it, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're perked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm also running these ones in
ProMix.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really use a lot of ProMix.
[SPEAKER_04]: So up here in Michigan, bro, I've just
like had a lot of issues with starting
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds and just weird little things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought a lot of it was my water.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've dialed that in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got really a decent little setup with RO
and a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually need to do some work on it
today, but I couldn't figure out what it
[SPEAKER_04]: was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back at home, the water, the city water
had a lot of calcium in it and other
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew it had a lot of calcium in it
because on my fish tanks, you get a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: calcium buildup and stuff like on the
filters and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that water was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, this water, I'm operating off of
fucking whale watering.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's dog shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes out like 300 PPMs last fucking
tap, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not RO'd, but it's semi-filtered or
some shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a pre-filter down there on that
system, on that whale system, and it's dog
[SPEAKER_04]: shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do have to run RO.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did switch to the ProMix with the
Micaraza, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if, I'm sounding like
Rob, or not Rob, but anyway, I'm sounding
[SPEAKER_04]: like somebody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, it actually really, my seeds,
they sprouted great, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really impressed with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's a coincidence.
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta take that shit with a grain of
salt.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm gonna start maybe trying to start
all my shit in ProMix.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got eight to 10 days there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went ahead and started at, I guess it's
probably been like seven to give them
[SPEAKER_04]: food.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been really smooth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Normally, I run in the Happy Frog or a mix
of Happy Frog and Cocoa or a mix of Cocoa
[SPEAKER_04]: and Fox Farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes Fox Farm can be a little too
much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I'm just really impressed with
the ProMix, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, do you run any ProMix?
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you fucked with ProMix at all?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you do a lot of organic shit,
but have you fucked with ProMix at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not really, not other than a clone
that I've gotten from a friend who has it
[SPEAKER_00]: in there, because that's what they use or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just get, either I make, you know,
I'll make three cubic feet at a time,
[SPEAKER_00]: just using a cubic foot of Pete,
cubic foot of castings and a cubic foot of
[SPEAKER_00]: pumice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that'll get me, you know,
pretty far, usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I need to feed, I give a bit of fish
hydrolysate from dram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's pretty much, that's most of
my feed really is just some dram fish
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrolysate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been, you know, I end up,
I still give microbes and fulvic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: little pinch of saphenins in there just to
like help the, the water, because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been, I've been like messing around with
dry backs a little bit for the last
[SPEAKER_00]: several, last several flowering runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just helps to like soak it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I ended up switching to what's it
called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I guess it's a pure Epsom salt stuff
from a, from Envy and some gypsum,
[SPEAKER_00]: some diamond K.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like what I taper, taper down to
whenever I'm not, when I'm trying to give
[SPEAKER_00]: Cal Mag, but not give anything else
attached to it besides, you know,
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_04]: The organic shit's over my head,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be honest, like a lot of that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I admire you guys for doing it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's something that is so cool
about weed in general, how many styles
[SPEAKER_04]: there are and how many ways there are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we all joke on each other,
bottle boys and shit, but I think it is
[SPEAKER_04]: really cool how, especially like with like
the discourse, seeing everybody's way they
[SPEAKER_04]: grow and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we give each, I know we joke on each
other, but I really do enjoy seeing
[SPEAKER_04]: people's way of doing shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's, you can learn a thing or two
from people, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I got, so I was, growing successfully
in organics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I started talking more and more
to, you know, people like bitter and local
[SPEAKER_00]: and earn and, you know, people who are
running fucking, uh, doing like hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: or drain to waste, whatever, um,
salt, um, like trying to pick up what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing and incorporate it into to
into my program, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that's been like, that's why I've
been messing with dry backs, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: messing with, uh, how I feed, um,
doing it like more based on, on when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're pushing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so trying kind of, you know,
cause I mean, it's still, it's still the
[SPEAKER_00]: same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and our systems there, there may be
differences in how we deliver those
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients or how we, how we do things,
but those plants still do better when,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're, they're finished
without nitrogen, you know, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to need calcium still.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finding a calcium and, you know,
just shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and being able to like, uh,
break down other processes better because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, hydroponic is such a,
you know, they fine tuned it to such a
[SPEAKER_00]: degree where, um, I guess it's a,
it's a lot more like scientific in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in what's actually going on, uh,
because they're controlling, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: much more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and just, just incorporating those,
you know, those, Hey, we found out this,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why we do it this way now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and figuring out how to,
you know, kind of incorporate it into,
[SPEAKER_00]: into how I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I still, I, I have friends who grow
both and it really doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, um, it's more so on the
grower and, and how well you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, you know, and how many, how many
problems pop up in that, in that grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, uh, I think, um, that's a good
place to end it for this one, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I think I got on this free,
uh, version only like two hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we're about to hit our two hour
mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'd like to have you back on here in
like a month or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got some time, maybe we can go
into like growing and stuff, maybe go into
[SPEAKER_04]: organics a little bit more, get more,
cause this is such a fucking huge topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like we could go on for probably
all day, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I'll be honest, dude,
I gotta take a shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm starving, bro, but I do appreciate you
coming on here with me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got local coming up, uh, to record.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got, uh, peaches wanted to do one on
edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully I'm gonna do a deep dive on
that with her and then, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So y'all look forward to that and,
uh, I appreciate you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
