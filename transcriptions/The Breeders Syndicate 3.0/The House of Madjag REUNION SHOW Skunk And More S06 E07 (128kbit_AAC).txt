[SPEAKER_01]: It was like it was like I was connected
with everything around me All of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: I just started questioning everything I'd
ever been told You know by the time I got
[SPEAKER_01]: high that very first time When it started
to hit me I'm like wow I Got high Can't

[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay with Johnny one of Madjags partners
from the Madjag Canyon and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: have a little discussion about The Madjag
era and his perspective on everything that
[SPEAKER_05]: went down and in his experiences from his
angle so magic didn't help me lead on this
[SPEAKER_05]: because he knows the the important
questions and Kind of just want to sit
[SPEAKER_05]: back maybe ask a few things here and there
But let you two have a conversation about
[SPEAKER_05]: those years because that's what people
really want to hear So let's take it away
[SPEAKER_08]: Madjag Well the other day I was speaking
with Matthew and trying to give him some
[SPEAKER_08]: history of how I met you and and it
started pretty far back with my friendship
[SPEAKER_08]: with Doug and then Hardy Because Hardy's
wife Was what was her name?
[SPEAKER_08]: Amanda Amanda, okay, I couldn't remember
Amanda Amanda's the one who invited you
[SPEAKER_08]: and and Wally and Martin, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: well She I was in well to go back to the
source, which is the the weed would you
[SPEAKER_10]: believe I was living in Manchester,
England with Martin and Allison whom both
[SPEAKER_10]: of whom you came to know later and Amanda
had already moved to Phoenix I had known
[SPEAKER_10]: her in Birmingham and through Martin they
were an item anyway, we were both studying
[SPEAKER_10]: film at Manchester University and Amanda
sent us some of the original Madjag,
[SPEAKER_10]: I think 78 and We smoked we saw these tiny
little joints, you know and back then
[SPEAKER_10]: Matthew you probably you know,
or maybe you're too young, but We would
[SPEAKER_10]: make splits out of you know, five skin
joints.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like a Quite a operation to add
tobacco in and stuff exactly lots of
[SPEAKER_10]: tobacco, you know, you had to be able to
smoke You needed some content in there
[SPEAKER_05]: with with the leaf matter, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well a hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: No.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, what I was gonna say was it was hash
mostly and then we had this little present
[SPEAKER_10]: from Arizona from Amanda in a little
vacuum pack.
[SPEAKER_10]: We saw these tiny little joints,
you know so two of us like Martin and I
[SPEAKER_10]: and there was another fellow there who was
sharing our little house in in Manchester
[SPEAKER_10]: and we thought what the hell is this?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and we proceeded to smoke the
entire thing, you know, yeah between two
[SPEAKER_10]: of us and You know 20 minutes later.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're in the catatonic state We just had
never experienced, you know hashing sketch
[SPEAKER_10]: as you know better than I you know is much
more different high to the oh,
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah, you know grass and and Jim Madjag
there had grown the Madjag, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that was your year before You did
it with Doug Jimbo or no, it was with
[SPEAKER_10]: Doug, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it must have been that year.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah
[SPEAKER_10]: You know Jim I think it was sooner I think
it came sooner my recollection is that
[SPEAKER_10]: because But maybe not but anyway,
no, I think it was sooner.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, it was grass as opposed to hash
That's the point and it was and we were
[SPEAKER_10]: completely ripped, you know for four or
five hours barely able to function because
[SPEAKER_10]: we've completely overdone it, you know,
and yeah and Anyway, so I I have some
[SPEAKER_05]: questions for you since you were in
Manchester What year what era was this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Roughly 70s.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, 76 77, you know, we went there in
the autumn of 76 and was a one-year film
[SPEAKER_10]: course I was already working at the BBC
and it stopped me when you've had enough
[SPEAKER_10]: of all this but I don't know working in
the BBC and then I went to study film it's
[SPEAKER_10]: to advance my Career which and anyway,
and I spent a year up there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we were there from 76 to June 77 autumn
76.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the year.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where were you raised in England?
[SPEAKER_10]: I was I was brought up on a farm in
Devonshire Devonshire.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, if you know England at all,
that's the southwest corner My dad was a
[SPEAKER_10]: farmer and we had a lovely childhood on a
farm in Devon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and then I went to Birmingham
University the teacher training part of
[SPEAKER_10]: after a year, I wanted to be a teacher
which So Birmingham great cities these if
[SPEAKER_10]: I may Birmingham and Manchester great
music scenes I collect music from the punk
[SPEAKER_05]: rock and northern soul specifically
northern soul like 70s 60s northern soul
[SPEAKER_05]: and The reggae stuff that was coming in
during the late 70s and late 60s early 70s
[SPEAKER_05]: to Manchester.
[SPEAKER_10]: I collect all that Stuff all of it and
Birmingham.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't forget.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah bring it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just It's close to my heart.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I had six or seven great years
there and Birmingham we used to go to the
[SPEAKER_10]: to the scar and reggae Really?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: The we got to know through my work at the
BBC we get we got all these characters
[SPEAKER_04]: come in and and Out there at the BBC Don
Letts the DJ Have you heard of him?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't remember say it again the name
Don Letts.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was an old reggae DJ.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember that name.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah Yeah, and of course one of the
reasons Jim invited me and I've written a
[SPEAKER_10]: book about this About you know this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: So a lot of that that reference to my time
in Birmingham is in this novel.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's actually I'm working on the last
Anyway, it's on my bed here, but I'm
[SPEAKER_10]: working on the last Read through it's
gonna come out and I'll be glad to send
[SPEAKER_10]: you a copy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I love it Yeah, anyway long story,
but that's yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Birmingham was wonderful back then
and great clubs too and Tremendous bands
[SPEAKER_10]: ELO and Spencer Davis that became traffic.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Ned Zeppelin just ran the corner and
Wolverhampton and right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, lots of lots of stunning bands.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, the scar and the reggae scene
was tremendous and some of the Jamaican
[SPEAKER_10]: guys would take over these Whole streets
of you know row houses.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you can always call them Terrace We
call them in England and one house would
[SPEAKER_10]: be dedicated for the Chabines They called
them which is the parties, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: oh wow Yeah, and I remember going there
the first time with three or four mates We
[SPEAKER_10]: were the only white guys there,
you know, and we were tolerated I don't
[SPEAKER_10]: know how welcome we were but when you when
you went in, you know, the guy would hand
[SPEAKER_10]: you a Cone of ganja, you know,
you know that with the way they grew the
[SPEAKER_10]: grass in Jamaica Yeah, and you'd powerful
you'd have one each, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: that's awesome, you know and and and
they'd be playing that really cool
[SPEAKER_10]: laid-back scar and and reggae and What a
scene, you know And everybody ripped
[SPEAKER_05]: across you know, I would have I would have
that's that's what I would dream to have
[SPEAKER_05]: been around for it like if I could go back
in a time machine would be to see that era
[SPEAKER_05]: of England because the music the scar the
reggae scene and how many people influence
[SPEAKER_05]: later on Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was it was great times man.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were wild, you know or in fact,
you know when I came to Arizona Jim
[SPEAKER_10]: probably saved my life, you know because
We would have been finished at 50,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, but yeah, yeah, so Go ahead a
hash culture In England, like was that is
[SPEAKER_05]: it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah We seldom saw grass at least in
the scenes I was in as I say the ganja
[SPEAKER_10]: that the Jamaicans brought in of course
from the Caribbean Caribbean was the
[SPEAKER_10]: closest we saw to any leaf, you know,
we got we got the Lebanese the blonde
[SPEAKER_10]: Lebanese sometimes and then the also the
Afghani Yeah, sometimes the Afghani was
[SPEAKER_10]: streaked with white and I don't know we we
used to Maybe we were dreaming but we
[SPEAKER_05]: think it was open a minute, you know,
maybe yeah, I've heard about that so I was
[SPEAKER_05]: watching a video the other day and there
was they were showing the process of how
[SPEAKER_05]: the hash is mixed and made in Afghanistan
and What they were doing was bringing in
[SPEAKER_05]: they had the nice hash the creamy
beautiful stuff and they had it all melted
[SPEAKER_05]: down, you know Really worked real heavy
and they were throwing in the garbage on
[SPEAKER_05]: top of it garbage.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit of opium Oh Little bit a
little bit of like the crappy hash from
[SPEAKER_05]: the year and they were mixing it all in so
that they could sell it for a higher price
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, they were mixing in all kinds
of crap just to just to sell it for a
[SPEAKER_05]: higher price and apparently they do this
each year and it's an old practice of
[SPEAKER_05]: mixing the bad hash with the good hash But
yeah, they also mix in supposedly opium
[SPEAKER_10]: from what that said Yeah, yeah,
yeah the streaks, you know, remember the
[SPEAKER_10]: white streaks and it the Afghani was the
sort of thing Lebanese was okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Moroccan was okay You know, well fine,
you know, but but the Afghani everybody
[SPEAKER_10]: wanted that and it was it was quite a bit
more powerful, you know, and I we always
[SPEAKER_10]: thought because it was you know,
really, you know, you didn't feel much
[SPEAKER_10]: pain for After having some of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was tremendous, you know, but we always
you know And it was an education to if I
[SPEAKER_10]: may go on to Arizona, you know to to to
meet Jimbo and and and yeah smoke the this
[SPEAKER_10]: that would have been Jim and I worked for
two years in the canyon my book only
[SPEAKER_10]: chronicles one but I Remember the first
meeting Jim at David Hardy's this guy that
[SPEAKER_10]: was married to the English girl.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the connection, you know and
smoking grass in the morning, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: I was thinking wow, you know because we
only in England it was you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: you went out and had five pints of strong
beer Yeah back and and you were you were
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, you couldn't move hardly laugh
or I bet a girl with you you might be
[SPEAKER_10]: Mischief with her but mostly it was you
know, you just laid out right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but but that was the introduction to
grass and and how much more invigorating
[SPEAKER_10]: it was as opposed to Innovating,
you know, yes the the oxidization you guys
[SPEAKER_10]: know better than I sure, you know,
you know when That was the trouble with
[SPEAKER_10]: the small sticks and seeds that came in
from Mexico, right and Columbia it was It
[SPEAKER_10]: zonked you out.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got high but it wasn't invigorating
and that's what turned me on to The mad
[SPEAKER_10]: jagweed was this, you know, you have a
puff in the morning We used to go and
[SPEAKER_10]: throw the football around and yeah,
David Hardy had a little park opposite
[SPEAKER_10]: there You may review.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure remember that Jim, but you know,
yeah buddy the reason why I said 78 is
[SPEAKER_08]: that's when Doug and I grew and we only
grew once with Robert and I I didn't have
[SPEAKER_08]: I I didn't know David Hardy yet or Amanda
So it was Doug and I our first year in 78
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, maybe I'm inventing this story to
make it because that's what I wrote about
[SPEAKER_10]: in the book.
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway But I remember I guess it was a
the whole point was that it was grass,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know in those little New York needles
as opposed to the so the Chunk of hash
[SPEAKER_10]: used to get and we'd break off a bit of
hash and we'd heat it You guys know all
[SPEAKER_10]: that right and then you crumble it into
the tobacco where this but the grass that
[SPEAKER_10]: we smoked in Manchester that year was the
first real, you know neat strong grass
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense though because the the
even the Jamaican Colombian well,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about Jamaican it probably
Colombian Mexican a lot of that stuff was
[SPEAKER_05]: you know Dried in the Sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was all just oxidized to shit and
and can be heavy CBN You're gonna be
[SPEAKER_05]: tired.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna wear you out So that's what
most people were used to when you got like
[SPEAKER_05]: that fresh grown not oxidized not sun
dried not gold Weed I'm sure that was just
[SPEAKER_05]: so energizing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah for sure and and I think that Jim was
probably in at the very early stages of I
[SPEAKER_10]: think it was Humboldt County, of course is
famous for starting it probably in the mid
[SPEAKER_10]: seventies, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: and yeah, the guy's learning how to pull
the males and and how to how to and the
[SPEAKER_10]: three the Vital three four days after you
cut it, you know how you took care of it
[SPEAKER_10]: and and That was an idea again that I
developed which didn't actually happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's a novel what I wrote and
and the second part is about Going down to
[SPEAKER_10]: Mexico in and to Oaxaca, which was the
origin of the seeds, you know Yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: and and Jim if I don't throw him under the
bus here I think the statute of
[SPEAKER_10]: limitations is right out but You know his
connections down there with with some
[SPEAKER_10]: characters.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, that's that's later in the story
And and yeah, it was grass was was was,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know opened our minds in a way in
every sense You know the the since Amir
[SPEAKER_10]: green the green I think we used to call
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not an expert on these strains or
anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seldom had very much after that my
years with Jim my early years in America
[SPEAKER_05]: have occasional pockets you you were there
at the at the beginning and that's just
[SPEAKER_05]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's what that's what fascinates
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not necessarily Like does this guy
know everything about strains?
[SPEAKER_05]: Does he know everything about breeding?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's the guys who were there the the
guys who took the risks that put their
[SPEAKER_05]: lives on the line to get us from point A
to point B and those are the guys that We
[SPEAKER_05]: all like people of my generation Really
look up to because like I'm from a
[SPEAKER_05]: generation where like when I started
growing real heavily It was during
[SPEAKER_05]: California's prop 215.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was already semi-legal, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was dealing other stuff that wasn't
quite so legal and trying to walk that
[SPEAKER_05]: fine line You know and and I I spent
countless nights up wondering if my door
[SPEAKER_05]: was gonna get hit because you know The
plants were too smelly, you know during
[SPEAKER_05]: harvest time that the harvest time sweats
You know, like so I can only imagine
[SPEAKER_05]: during an era where it's just draconian
laws I mean you were coming from England
[SPEAKER_05]: risking it all over here and not knowing
what your future would hold if you got
[SPEAKER_05]: caught It's just it's pretty pretty
inspiring pretty inspiring.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you I mean, yeah, I mean the
motive for me was of course was was the
[SPEAKER_10]: adventure I loved the the southwest the
dry climate compared to you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: obviously a damp wet colder climate in
England and yeah being out in the I was
[SPEAKER_10]: already a bit of a rock climber and and
back country kind of guy and I just loved
[SPEAKER_10]: it and and I You know fell in love with
this man here.
[SPEAKER_10]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_10]: We spent a lot of time in the test I'm
sorry feeble English jokes.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no No, you know what impressed me was
how organized Jimbo was, you know I
[SPEAKER_10]: thought I was coming into these kind of I
would know, you know before I committed
[SPEAKER_10]: obviously we and before he committed to me
we didn't know one another in You know the
[SPEAKER_10]: the winter of 79 we met I think it down in
Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't it Jim?
[SPEAKER_08]: At David's house, I think so David's or or
it Was Doug living down there then no,
[SPEAKER_10]: no, I don't think so It must have been
that David right but but but I started to
[SPEAKER_10]: talk to Jim and and and and Doug for
reasons that Left alone he wasn't able to
[SPEAKER_10]: work that year.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and and so Jim started to talk to me
about it and I thought well, what am I
[SPEAKER_10]: getting into you know, just Kind of you
know bunch of spaced out hippies and it's
[SPEAKER_10]: gonna Be dangerous, but Jim was so
organized.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's he's kind of a neat freak.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah Yeah, he's very organized much neater
than me and I know that I you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: we We were like these two Poles apart,
you know, here's me coming from London
[SPEAKER_10]: from working in the BBC and a drinking
kind of Lay about you know, yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: and there's this guy that was into Carlos
Castaneda And much more spiritual and much
[SPEAKER_10]: more healthy as I say, he probably saved
me from an early death Yeah, I've gone
[SPEAKER_10]: back to London.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have carried on that You know very
unhealthy life, but but Jim but Jim was so
[SPEAKER_10]: organized and Once I saw all that and how
together he was, you know That that's what
[SPEAKER_10]: that's what persuaded me.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know if I'd run into this guy who was
utterly stoned all the while not to say
[SPEAKER_10]: that we Take in all sorts of things and I
don't know how much he wants me to tell
[SPEAKER_10]: you about This wonderful little house in
Cottonwood Arizona cat claw on the street
[SPEAKER_10]: was called cat claw and it was like this
little haven of safety, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: because obviously our crop was in the
mountains, you know in the canyon and And
[SPEAKER_10]: as soon as I went into his house and saw
how neat and tidy kept everything and
[SPEAKER_10]: everything stashed away.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's he's Infamous in our circles for his
little bottles.
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got one right here Well, this this might
not be typical but this is something you
[SPEAKER_10]: give me but he's he's infamous of having
all these little tiny bottles with the
[SPEAKER_10]: various, you know There you go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's he's always leaving these little
things out I'll say when you read the book
[SPEAKER_10]: and when Netflix Makes the film out of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm dreaming one hitter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, nice brand new I went in the head
shop recently and saw this and you open it
[SPEAKER_08]: up and put your buds inside and then you
pull the match Sneaker tokes didn't you
[SPEAKER_10]: have a pipe that we could toke in bars I
remember we went to Prescott that evening
[SPEAKER_10]: for the that day for the rodeo Fourth of
July rodeo.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, all the July road Matt We never saw
a cowboy a cow a bull or anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were just in the bars and I and Jim I
remember we went into that we drove his
[SPEAKER_10]: car across I think there were five or six
of us and we drove across from Jerome,
[SPEAKER_10]: Arizona.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called great place it was back then
and And we went over the mountains to
[SPEAKER_10]: Prescott.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a big windy, you know Yeah,
and then we went into a country in Western
[SPEAKER_10]: bar to start the afternoon, you know to
get a drink Yeah, Jim Jim had these m80s.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what those are?
[SPEAKER_10]: The explosives.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah And he said Johnny go around the back
and we'll come in the two doors,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know So I thought what the hell is
this, you know, and I let the but I lit
[SPEAKER_10]: it, you know And and I threw it down by
the door and open the door That was your
[SPEAKER_09]: entrance yeah, and then just as I came in
one side and all the Cowboys, you know
[SPEAKER_10]: where their hats and the girl,
you know It was a real country in Western
[SPEAKER_10]: bar.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and then on the other side Jim
dropped his and So so all the heads turned
[SPEAKER_10]: to us, you know, because the place was
pretty packed Rodeo July 4th and then boom
[SPEAKER_10]: the crack goes off the other side and in
come the other two or three guys with With
[SPEAKER_10]: Jimbo and um, I wouldn't say we took over
the bar, but you know, that's a way to
[SPEAKER_06]: make an entrance Yeah, I can appreciate
that We were walking down the street on
[SPEAKER_08]: the way there and we passed it You know
people have to park their vehicles for 10
[SPEAKER_08]: 15 blocks in all directions and they'll
come in two days early and park them and
[SPEAKER_08]: Sleep in the back of them because you
can't there's no place to park 10 20 000
[SPEAKER_08]: people show up So we're walking down the
street from where we parked And there was
[SPEAKER_08]: a pickup truck with cases of beer just
piled On each other in the back and we
[SPEAKER_08]: looked around and we grabbed we each I
don't know I think we grabbed like two
[SPEAKER_08]: cases and We just took off down the street
and when we got to Main Street back there
[SPEAKER_08]: on Whiskey Row Which it was legal then to
walk with alcohol in the open outside on
[SPEAKER_08]: Whiskey Row on this two block section.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just started handing beers to people
and six packs to people and We had so
[SPEAKER_08]: much.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just funny I I hope whoever saw
that Whoever's truck that is it would be
[SPEAKER_08]: really cool if they were watching this
Yeah, except for your bill Right now it
[SPEAKER_10]: was the wildest couple of years of my life
and that's that's saying something,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know And these two years I spent with
my partner here, you know, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: but That's what persuaded me, you know the
grass and the adventure of it for sure
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously the hope to make some money,
you know, which we certainly did You know,
[SPEAKER_10]: we had two years the first year we We
found a wonderful little garden not so
[SPEAKER_10]: little maybe and we worked like hell to
prepare that just the two of us that year
[SPEAKER_10]: and we dug a lot of holes remember those
holes Jim that we dug and and then this
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we pulled it off and it was it
was great.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I mean it was yeah, the risk was
huge It was a Mormon County Christ.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was Yeah, we would have been in serious
trouble if we've been napped, you know
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was felt in the canyon that you
know I didn't say that we were safe
[SPEAKER_10]: because you know, there was methods,
you know, they had the infrared cameras I
[SPEAKER_10]: believe in those days, you know and and
also of course even though We wound the
[SPEAKER_10]: you know the garden through the we had
manzanita manzanita, right Jim on one side
[SPEAKER_10]: and Pine trees and pine trees and it was
up from the creek, you know, you could
[SPEAKER_10]: walk by One of the things I always
remember of course in the autumn in the
[SPEAKER_10]: fall when it was due was the smell You
could absolutely smell the weed from the
[SPEAKER_10]: creek, you know Yeah, so a guy walking
through here if anybody did I mean in
[SPEAKER_10]: Jim's Says that in four years,
I don't think we saw more than one one or
[SPEAKER_10]: two one footstep and that was some hippie
hiker went through there but Very wasn't
[SPEAKER_10]: that it was so, you know 30 miles from a
road or anything But to get into it you
[SPEAKER_10]: had to descend via an enormously
exhausting Rockfall But basalt it is there
[SPEAKER_10]: was and and if you we tried we looked for
many other ways, but they were all not
[SPEAKER_10]: only Virtually impossible and exhausting
but dangerous too because there'll be
[SPEAKER_10]: cliffs and then there'd be a scree slope
right and then another cliff and it to
[SPEAKER_10]: wind your way through and the and The soil
was loose.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there were times I remember when
we explored I don't know if you remember
[SPEAKER_10]: Jim, but you know, there was a chance you
could have slipped and gone over the edge,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, not to mention I got speared by
You know one of those dreadful agaves that
[SPEAKER_10]: have like a needle on the end.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah my leg was swollen for Because
they're slightly poisonous, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah Agave paris paris.
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember was one paras paras.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway Anyway, that was the only way we
got we dropped in was through that,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, you was no path.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just working your way down these
boulders and And when the people came in
[SPEAKER_10]: to help us, you know with the harvest at
the end of the year, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: they were exhausted I bet utterly unused
to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were in good shape and even so there
wasn't a trail going down You actually had
[SPEAKER_05]: to descend boulders and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a while.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a lot of branches lots of branches
and bushes Right crashing through them and
[SPEAKER_08]: we very carefully clip just a few That
were in critical spots where you might
[SPEAKER_08]: have to jump from one boulder Down three
feet to a big boulder and you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: you couldn't be jumping into oblivion
without seeing it So we cut a branch so
[SPEAKER_08]: you could at least see where you're gonna
land Right once I was stepping down with a
[SPEAKER_08]: 30 40 pound pack and I already took the
Motion to move and there was a rattlesnake
[SPEAKER_08]: coiled up right where I was gonna step and
I had to throw myself sideways into the
[SPEAKER_08]: bushes my pack just pulled me down and
protected me it banged against the next
[SPEAKER_08]: boulder and You know, we had some
interesting little Experiences none of us
[SPEAKER_08]: ever got got bit or anything those
scorpion bites We did have a friend who
[SPEAKER_08]: came down who sprained his ankle really
bad Mike if you remember Mike I should do
[SPEAKER_08]: and we I know you do because you were
tuning a motorcycle with him and you had
[SPEAKER_08]: him get on the motorcycle your motorcycle
in Phoenix and he was on it holding the
[SPEAKER_08]: throttle and revving it and you were doing
something and you said okay now do this
[SPEAKER_08]: and he popped the clutch and The
motorcycle shot up into the air and he was
[SPEAKER_08]: flying behind it with his body Horizontal
to the ground and then he let go of the
[SPEAKER_08]: bike and it just kept going and then he he
did a full body slam boom down onto the
[SPEAKER_10]: ground He was accident prone that guy
Mike's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's still alive.
[SPEAKER_08]: He lives in North Phoenix last year.
[SPEAKER_08]: He doesn't remember things Well,
so he can't drive anymore, but I'll be
[SPEAKER_08]: going to see him in the next few weeks
along with Robert Yep All the time.
[SPEAKER_10]: We never got bitten.
[SPEAKER_10]: No that even the scorpions I once was
convinced there was a snake in my sleeping
[SPEAKER_10]: bag.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was probably had too much smoke that
night Yeah, no and Rattlers yeah a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: rattlesnakes a lot of rattlesnakes I
remember climbing up the what that was
[SPEAKER_10]: And putting my hand up on something and
hearing the rattle, you know And just
[SPEAKER_10]: jumping back like Jim did throw himself
into yeah It's such a shock, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, you don't mess around with those
things and you hear that rattle you jump
[SPEAKER_10]: right we have them out here In your in
your deserty area, you know, I think you
[SPEAKER_10]: survive, you know, I've heard that you can
survive a rattlesnake.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes Of course you do mostly, you know,
but they do say that you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's it's pretty pretty For 36 48 hours,
which would have meant if we were out
[SPEAKER_10]: there on our own, which we often were yeah
Lie in the shade and hope you had enough
[SPEAKER_10]: water because if you start to try to get
out You send it through your system.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I remember Jim gave us the Jimbo you
had those little rattlesnake kits,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Which had turned out to be worthless,
but at the time That they make you feel
[SPEAKER_09]: safe later well, they did a little bit but
they had a like a box cutter in them that
[SPEAKER_10]: you're supposed to slash at the And then
there was something like a suction thing I
[SPEAKER_10]: wasn't there that you're supposed to pull
them suck the venom out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah Well those came later and they were
more accurate because They were a empty
[SPEAKER_08]: big hypodermic and when you press down
they would suck in Oh, yeah, if you
[SPEAKER_08]: applied them within one minute of being
bitten It would get some venom out of the
[SPEAKER_08]: bite site before distributed to your
bloods unless you got struck on the neck
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you're a goner.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah Probably and the name of that wash we
nicknamed it the salt mine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because it would make you sweat so
much It was about four that was only about
[SPEAKER_08]: twelve or thirteen hundred feet vertical
only but at the bottom and where Doug and
[SPEAKER_08]: I first worked it was sixteen hundred feet
and we That's where you and I actually
[SPEAKER_08]: went in originally to the old garden and
then we started hiking upstream to look
[SPEAKER_08]: for a new garden and We were we couldn't
find anything that met our standards for
[SPEAKER_08]: four hours or something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we sat down Take a break and we
looked up above and we said that looks
[SPEAKER_08]: like a little alluvial plateau.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe up there there it was Yeah,
doubly I think I've already told map we
[SPEAKER_08]: called it the double e because if you get
the actual topal map of that area Which I
[SPEAKER_08]: won't disclose you it fell right under the
word Something Creek and the where the two
[SPEAKER_08]: E's were in Creek was exactly where the
garden was.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's funny That's how we named it the
double e that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a beautiful You know, that's the
other thing that I sort of inspired me as
[SPEAKER_10]: well or at least a right was how it was a
beautiful You know setting, you know this,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know Those creeks in those desert
canyons where they've got live water
[SPEAKER_10]: whether you have the sycamores and not too
sure if there's many cottonwoods,
[SPEAKER_10]: but alders You know anyway a riparian
Growth they call it, you know that grows
[SPEAKER_10]: alongside the streams, of course It's just
gorgeous down there and we had a swimming
[SPEAKER_10]: hole too Not exactly, you know almost like
a swimming pool that opened up Jim didn't
[SPEAKER_10]: it after the flood I think anyway,
there was a place where you we could
[SPEAKER_10]: plunge, you know and swim four or five
strokes So, you know in the heat of the
[SPEAKER_10]: summer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah right down there and of course we
drank straight from the creek all the time
[SPEAKER_10]: because Upstream, you know, we're up
towards the little town that we won't
[SPEAKER_10]: mention but Upstream of us it was dry.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you knew the water was fresh and you
know, we just drank straight from the and
[SPEAKER_10]: it was safe Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it came out below the town.
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't flow through the town,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, it could be polluted when it
rained of course, and it was a big summer
[SPEAKER_08]: thunderstorm It could wash through it if
someone had driven across it and there
[SPEAKER_08]: might be oil in it But for it to go miles
Yeah, it and us actually drink at that
[SPEAKER_08]: moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it would be so dilute.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah But through the summer it was pretty
dry for several miles above us and but it
[SPEAKER_08]: somehow the the water came above surface
in our section and that's why it was also
[SPEAKER_08]: safe because if you stood on the rim of
the Canyon in the summer with all the
[SPEAKER_08]: trees you couldn't see water Yeah,
there was only one or two spots that we'd
[SPEAKER_08]: see a glint of water if you walked along
The canyon edge which takes hours.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, yeah Yeah, it was it was quite
nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also realized that fishermen aren't
gonna go down in a hundred degree heat
[SPEAKER_08]: 1600 feet or whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah to go fishing and then have to hike
out in the heat in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no No, so Johnny was there during
skunk one, right the skunk one girl.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep Do you remember any of the sense as
you could describe them of this skunk one
[SPEAKER_05]: crop as it was going through flower?
[SPEAKER_05]: Close up close up smells if you can
remember Yeah, it was obviously completely
[SPEAKER_10]: different from the sativa which was in my
opinion lovely sense, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: in fact Jimbo had a good idea of course we
were up against the legality and legality
[SPEAKER_10]: of it then but to make the the sativa into
a Scent what do you call it perfume for?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what happened with that,
but but the skunk was completely
[SPEAKER_10]: different, you know, I mean it obviously
it was just like somebody just wasn't as
[SPEAKER_10]: bad as some as you know, a roadkill skunk,
but it was very very very powerful and
[SPEAKER_10]: much more Sort of what's the word?
[SPEAKER_10]: Accurate almost, you know much more well
potent true, but more sort of a punch in
[SPEAKER_10]: Pungent.
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was it was not as pleasant by any
means the sativa was beautiful
[SPEAKER_05]: Second so there was a skunkiness to it and
the skunk one with some absolutely
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely, right Jimbo Yeah, well greater
after harvest and they were dry because
[SPEAKER_08]: when you crush the bud to roll it it
filled a room Yeah easily That's wild.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't I didn't remember much about how
it smelled while it was growing I loved
[SPEAKER_08]: the scent of all those flowers,
but it was particularly skunk once It was
[SPEAKER_08]: dried and then you're gonna break a bud,
but you didn't even have to break it But
[SPEAKER_08]: if you open jar of that even in the house,
the whole house would be oh, yeah But the
[SPEAKER_10]: sativa to get back to it the the mad jag
as I was sort of you know, the mad jag was
[SPEAKER_10]: the sativa strain and You know those
blooms you could pull them down,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, obviously in the autumn,
you know and and just brush brush them a
[SPEAKER_10]: little bit god it was Delightful.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just great and and you really didn't
need to brush them that much as I say I
[SPEAKER_10]: mean you could if the wind was right when
you was crossing the creek or just walking
[SPEAKER_10]: around our camp, you know was hidden on
the far side of the from the garden from
[SPEAKER_10]: the blue real plane and You could
absolutely smell it and it's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I won't go on too much about my book,
but it was a big thing in The close
[SPEAKER_10]: scrapes that I wrote about in the novel
With them with the you know how the we
[SPEAKER_10]: nearly got caught because of the Smell and
I remember with when we came out when the
[SPEAKER_10]: year that Sammy helped us Jim Yeah,
this was just wonderful crazy guy that
[SPEAKER_10]: helped us with the work Swiss guy we we we
we had that camper that I got remember and
[SPEAKER_10]: We put all the boxes on the bunk and on
over the cab.
[SPEAKER_10]: You remember?
[SPEAKER_10]: that that set up and Sammy and I drove it
out and We went to we came around the way
[SPEAKER_10]: anyway long story but we wanted to have
breakfast or lunch or whatever it was we
[SPEAKER_10]: were driving out, you know, and We of
course you want it inside the camper.
[SPEAKER_10]: The smell was overpowering but even
outside you could smell it and And there
[SPEAKER_10]: was a scene we we went into the cafe to
get some you know to have a meal In this
[SPEAKER_10]: little town and the sheriff the deputy
sheriff's truck kept pulled alongside The
[SPEAKER_10]: the camper it was like a four-wheel drive,
you know with a camper rig on top Yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'm looking through the window and I
go I don't know if I'm allowed to use foul
[SPEAKER_10]: language.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you're okay Yeah, you know This is
dodgy you to put it mildly, you know Half
[SPEAKER_10]: the I don't know about half the crop but
boxes and boxes and we've enough to put
[SPEAKER_10]: you in a way, yeah, yeah, you know get you
put away and I was terrified that the
[SPEAKER_10]: sheriff would you know, probably some Tea
totaling Mormon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh for sure some backwards tea totaling
Mormon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes How's that smell you know,
anyway, yeah suffice to say that but I I
[SPEAKER_10]: think I've got a fairly good scene in the
book that sort of Mirrors that you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: let's let's talk about your book real
quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's it called?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called the year of The Mad Jag.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, you're the Mad Jag and Do you
have a website or a place where you do
[SPEAKER_10]: people to buy it?
[SPEAKER_10]: I do Shall I send you the link at the end?
[SPEAKER_05]: I just you can say it right here and then
I'll add it in at the end Well,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's Jonathan slated calm my full name
Jonathan Slator SLA to our and Maybe I can
[SPEAKER_10]: send you the link directly to it at the
end and you can check it on the screen
[SPEAKER_10]: when you edit Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's It's one two little awards.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the best one being the William
Faulkner creative writing competition.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's crazy in New Orleans.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I went to New Orleans and it's taken
a time of course here we are Jesus 40
[SPEAKER_10]: years later, but I wrote it In the 2000s I
was actually living in New Zealand and
[SPEAKER_10]: wrote a version that was worthless.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I wrote it again When I had some time
when my children were taking care of
[SPEAKER_10]: themselves a bit more anyway when I was I
live up here in Taos, New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and anyway, so and I tried to get a
Traditional publisher, you know an agent
[SPEAKER_10]: and the whole deal but there's so so very
few of those now You know, especially for
[SPEAKER_10]: new unknown writers, you know,
yeah You know everything's it's the whole
[SPEAKER_10]: publishing thing is just like a film
business I've worked in the film business.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all marketing how you market yourself
how much money you have to market yourself
[SPEAKER_10]: everything Yeah, it's all that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I guess my point was that it's all
in turmoil.
[SPEAKER_10]: It changes every week You know almost your
every year, you know, nobody really knows
[SPEAKER_10]: what's gonna happen next, you know the
whole shift to Kindles and yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know the digital and audiobooks so
anyway the point of all that being that as
[SPEAKER_10]: I sort of tried to get many times I send
it to 60 70 agents and publishers and you
[SPEAKER_10]: know got sick and tired of the rejection.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I almost gave up on it Yeah,
but but I decided recently I actually a
[SPEAKER_10]: production designer on a film I was
working on read it and a couple years ago
[SPEAKER_10]: and he said this is great You got to get
it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying not to slap my own back too
much, but It's a good story.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm obviously biased but thanks to
that man sitting on the top of the screen
[SPEAKER_10]: there, you know, and yeah I mean it was
you know, somebody once told me I should
[SPEAKER_10]: write a memoir and I said no is that
wouldn't be interesting, you know because
[SPEAKER_10]: For all the risk that we took There was
nothing that thrilling happened,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, we weren't chased by the law or
yeah Yeah, there was you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: we were pretty organized and we kept no
gunfights.
[SPEAKER_10]: No nothing out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah right and Jim is very thorough bloke
and I remember I've watched a little bit
[SPEAKER_10]: of your previous One and you know talking
about scattering the the leaves in the
[SPEAKER_10]: morning, you know We would we would always
we call it a watering moon You know,
[SPEAKER_10]: the early phase of the moon was always the
one you wanted to be watering in because
[SPEAKER_10]: we in the summer We would take turns.
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't both need to go in, you know
Especially the first year when we only had
[SPEAKER_10]: the one garden second year It was more
work, but one guy could do it,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, it's hard sure you get that pump
go in and The Briggs and Stratton and it
[SPEAKER_10]: was roaring, you know, and you spent four
hours blundering around trying to keep the
[SPEAKER_10]: hoses from you know Spilling over we had a
like a little Terrace system, you know
[SPEAKER_10]: with little walls like a bit like a rice
paddy in in Southeast Asia, you know and
[SPEAKER_10]: and anyway, the point of all that was that
yeah, we would It was great to have them
[SPEAKER_10]: the moon waxing come over the canyon rim.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were in a nice East West part that we
chose it So that we'd have maximum Sun,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: But of course it helped also for maximum
moonlight and and so the the you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: the Watering was was one guy and that was
always of course a risk as well You know,
[SPEAKER_10]: you're on your own down there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, anything could happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: You get stung by a scorpion You just twist
your ankle and you probably couldn't get
[SPEAKER_10]: out for Three days, you know, I mean you
wouldn't have died hopefully from twisted
[SPEAKER_10]: ankle, but you would have been it I
remember you did a terrible twist yourself
[SPEAKER_10]: once Jimbo to I remember you were
struggling to get out because of that and
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, it was it was a great adventure.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's for sure, you know and again I am
it was so beautiful and one of the things
[SPEAKER_10]: I was I remember later on as well was
having the that the water because of the
[SPEAKER_10]: Continued growth and the drought in the
southwest Jim you maybe you know more
[SPEAKER_10]: about this than I because I went to New
Mexico and you of course stay but the
[SPEAKER_10]: There's this gun The creek was so depleted
that guys who went in and used our setup
[SPEAKER_10]: the next couple of years Could barely oh
there we are In 1980 roughly and my
[SPEAKER_08]: daughter who's 48 years old right now
That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are in good shape.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were in shape Look at Jim.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you didn't go he's you go in and out
of that Canyon man every week You were
[SPEAKER_05]: hard as they say Yeah, you could do some
you guys could have been doing some MMA or
[SPEAKER_05]: ultimate fighting back then with that that
kind of shape Climbing rocks and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Yeah So a question I I do have for
you It you know Jim even just since I've
[SPEAKER_05]: I've met him and slowly become friends and
learn from him I've had a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: synchronicities in my life just weird
little occurrences like weird Things just
[SPEAKER_05]: keep falling in place with different
people just that never really happened
[SPEAKER_05]: would never really fall together Did you
did he influence your life spiritually or
[SPEAKER_05]: anything at all?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, yeah, absolutely I'm not a
particularly I'm I was coming from this
[SPEAKER_10]: cynical skeptical world of An urban
environment London UK is very very atheist
[SPEAKER_05]: like I've noticed that like watching the
TV program It's common to be atheist.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was in the US.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not you know, yeah No, I I am still a
very much an atheist.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my yeah, I don't think that Frankly
religion has done more good than harm in
[SPEAKER_10]: the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd argue we could debate that for a long
while But absolutely I think what Jim
[SPEAKER_10]: reminded and the experience reminded me of
was I'd left home at 18 to go to the
[SPEAKER_10]: cities, you know I was a farm boy and it
brought back to me and again, this is in
[SPEAKER_10]: the book the value if you will of
wilderness and and I've become more of an
[SPEAKER_10]: animist because of that, you know,
I don't follow the I I don't even frankly
[SPEAKER_10]: have a lot of time for the the Eastern
religions that have come into and Jim gave
[SPEAKER_10]: me some of that I would say but not in any
kind of a conventional way do I think I
[SPEAKER_10]: think a lot of the a lot of the popularity
of the Western religions Buddhism and
[SPEAKER_10]: Hinduism and everything And Jim and I may
disagree on this, but you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's it's very superficial in so
many ways that what you know as Especially
[SPEAKER_10]: in your state, I would argue, you know,
California, you know, there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's a bollocks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pardon me, you know, I mean Beverly Hills
Buddhists are kind of you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's just they just grab the Cool side of
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's peaceful.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there's nothing wrong with
meditating.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a great thing to do But you know,
you don't study also the the Four Noble
[SPEAKER_10]: Truths and samsara and and you know,
I tried it I meditated up here and did the
[SPEAKER_10]: slow walking and everything and tried to
get into it as I got older looking for
[SPEAKER_10]: some answers, but I In answer to your
question, I think that my spirituality
[SPEAKER_10]: lies in the natural world.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is perhaps isn't very original But
you know, that's my and those two years in
[SPEAKER_10]: that Canyon Absolutely, you know built
that into me much more took me back to my
[SPEAKER_10]: years growing up on a farm but also the
feeling that there's if there's There is
[SPEAKER_10]: any power out there it comes in the
natural world trees the creek the stones
[SPEAKER_10]: even you know that that's what I believe
it's fascinating because like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know in through my own journey in life
I've gone from so much is like someone who
[SPEAKER_05]: was really into Satanism because I started
off Catholic So, of course as a young punk
[SPEAKER_05]: rock kid, that's like 12 13 I immediately
get into Satanism because like the
[SPEAKER_05]: complete opposite right like just what is
the opposite of what I my parents like Is
[SPEAKER_05]: it what can make my parents mad,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, but after a while I got I you know,
of course very as I got older and into
[SPEAKER_05]: into science and botany I got more into
atheism and logic and and reasoning and
[SPEAKER_05]: Over time I've just kind of especially
with plants learning from plants being
[SPEAKER_05]: around plants so long I've come to realize
and I don't know how much it makes sense
[SPEAKER_05]: because I've never really got I've never
really vibed with like the whole hippie
[SPEAKER_05]: like Mother Earth type thing, but I think
that's probably closest to what I believe
[SPEAKER_05]: now as an adult that that there is a lot
more conscious on this earth than we have
[SPEAKER_05]: any clue just because it doesn't have a
brain doesn't necessarily mean it can't
[SPEAKER_05]: communicate and communication is key like
to all living beings and life and I have
[SPEAKER_05]: just kind of come to a similar conclusion
in that if there is something existing
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably very natural and been here
among us as in the plants the the actual
[SPEAKER_05]: earth and that's where a lot of this
energy is probably coming from as best I
[SPEAKER_05]: can tell you know as a human who can't
have any answers It seems to make the most
[SPEAKER_05]: sense to me after interacting with all
these plants and how much they've changed
[SPEAKER_05]: my life for the better Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: No.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I agree more and to me there's a great
deal more logic in the life force if you
[SPEAKER_10]: will coming from This this this natural
world that's been going for what?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the big bang 13 billion years ago?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah Yeah, a lot more sense than believing
that somebody walked out of a mountain
[SPEAKER_10]: with some tablets with some rules on them
You know, I mean that's to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just nonsense and Yeah,
very human very human created.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's still missing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right, huh?
[SPEAKER_10]: What do they say who is it says if God If
God had an existed man would have invented
[SPEAKER_10]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean I mean, it's obviously You know,
when were you born Matt once your era what
[SPEAKER_05]: how old you 1981 so at the end of 1981,
I'm 41.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay Yeah, yeah, we're both 70.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you 72?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Jim?
[SPEAKER_10]: Two weeks two weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh wait, when's your birthday Jim 13th
13th.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I didn't know that Well,
you know also When you sleep next to a
[SPEAKER_08]: creek and in here in the sound at night in
the wilderness and In the stars were as
[SPEAKER_08]: bright as you can ever imagine you have
you'd have to go Very few places in
[SPEAKER_08]: America today to be away from city lights
and no town that was near us was hundreds
[SPEAKER_08]: of people so it there was no light for
many many many miles right tens and tens
[SPEAKER_08]: and twenties of miles and Listening to the
sound of a creek flowing by for a year or
[SPEAKER_08]: two The time that you go every week.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just so Healing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a healing thing my box nuts with a
with a With a poem that was translated by
[SPEAKER_10]: Gary Snyder, you know that name the the
poet anyway, it's I Walk for thousands of
[SPEAKER_10]: you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, it's a long story, but it ends up
I'll sleep by the creek and purify my ears
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it's it's from the cold mountain
poems of the of the I think 8th century
[SPEAKER_10]: recluse And Shan yeah, it's in yeah,
that's how I opened the book.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was what got us that you know To
get back to your thoughts about the
[SPEAKER_10]: experience and and everything It was so
lovely being down there and I never felt
[SPEAKER_10]: like it even if they had discovered us
down there the chances of them,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know and Jim and I discussed it,
you know that they would probably wait for
[SPEAKER_10]: us to hike out with something that they
could get you know, they wouldn't stake
[SPEAKER_10]: out the garden because You know travel
down there just to get you in they know
[SPEAKER_10]: you're gonna come back out exactly and You
know and would they and if we were down
[SPEAKER_10]: there and we had at least you know a
chance We could get away from those guys
[SPEAKER_05]: probably, you know Yeah, and they don't
know what you have down there as far as it
[SPEAKER_05]: could have been You know cartel with
weapons not as a cartel, but you know what
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean people with weapons anything So
yeah, they would definitely wait for you
[SPEAKER_05]: guys to come out loading packs,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well in the nearby Canyon Jim There was a
there was a cartel that went to work there
[SPEAKER_10]: didn't they and they always were were
packing heat Wasn't they?
[SPEAKER_08]: That was much longer after us.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean was it recent years and in the
2000s I was it as late as that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah But also we had day packs but today
people call bug-out bags or For for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think my nickname was a parachute So if
we knew people were coming down into the
[SPEAKER_08]: canyon were above us or something crazy We
could go down our Canyon Which led to
[SPEAKER_08]: another Canyon which led to another Canyon
and we could it could take a day or two
[SPEAKER_08]: But we could disappear and never be found
because we didn't park a car ever for
[SPEAKER_08]: those two years out there Maybe the first
year a little bit but the second year we
[SPEAKER_08]: had people drop us off and pick us up
every week because it was too Risky
[SPEAKER_08]: because like I mentioned earlier the guys
in the canyon next to us They parked a
[SPEAKER_08]: truck week after week there and eventually
The rancher called the forest service.
[SPEAKER_08]: They checked the place and what do you
know?
[SPEAKER_08]: They're from Jerome, which was the hippie
capital So they just waited till they came
[SPEAKER_08]: out and took everything home to Jerome and
showed up at their house and got him So I
[SPEAKER_05]: was sorry question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I was gonna say that was another
thing that you know, we we were One of a
[SPEAKER_10]: better time we were pretty Rigorous about
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were professional about it and most
Because Jim insisted I'd say hey we could
[SPEAKER_10]: drive the hell out there not always but
you know that we would have a few
[SPEAKER_10]: back-and-forths because who wants to hike
another three miles, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: and So when we did leave cars,
we would leave them a long way away,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know and make that extra effort to get
in there, you know, right and then as Jim
[SPEAKER_10]: says the second year when we really have
We doubled our yield I think or doubled
[SPEAKER_10]: our size because we we took another we
made another garden the second year and
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, sorry you were gonna ask
something that so one thing that I know
[SPEAKER_05]: people are gonna want me to ask before we
finish up and I it Someone asked if you
[SPEAKER_05]: guys ever saw UFOs in the sky out there
and those clear clear nights Well,
[SPEAKER_10]: no, I didn't James got some other stories
that he might tell I do remember the
[SPEAKER_10]: satellites That were mostly north to south
back then and that's 40 odd years ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were the music we were Right mate.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were kind of intrigued by what the hell
they were and so you realize their
[SPEAKER_05]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah Yeah, and they also wink in and out
with this son.
[SPEAKER_10]: They are only they're reflecting the Sun
that's gone down behind the horizon,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know Yeah, right, you know and because
there's some thousands of them now,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean Elon Musk has got a Yeah tons so in
those days they were much much less You
[SPEAKER_10]: know well known and so when we I can
remember first seeing them and thinking
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what the hell is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but have you guys seen the
darling pain yet?
[SPEAKER_05]: The what mate starling train Elon Musk's I
there was one one morning I was driving
[SPEAKER_05]: somewhere It was like 5 a.m.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was pitch black outside driving in
my car and I look up and there is a stream
[SPEAKER_05]: of lights like dots Going across the whole
Sky and I stopped in my car got out in the
[SPEAKER_05]: middle of the street There's other people
stopping their car getting out in the
[SPEAKER_05]: middle of the street It's the first time
that anybody's seen starling train yet and
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody's thinking this is a big huge
massive UFO because it is just going
[SPEAKER_05]: across the whole sky Yeah turn out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have not seen that but it's crazy
when you see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's crazy geosynchronous and there's over
1500 now, so How far apart would they to
[SPEAKER_08]: go around the circumference of the earth
would that make them?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was it I mean it was it stretched
across At least half the sky Wow That's
[SPEAKER_05]: how and and there were probably eight or
nine dots throughout that half the sky.
[SPEAKER_08]: We saw great meteorites that I'm sure once
I was hiking out to the canyon and I got
[SPEAKER_08]: to the edge of the canyon near near
sunset, you know in the late afternoon and
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard the sound and I looked down and
coming up the canyon work was a jet and an
[SPEAKER_08]: Air Force jet hundreds of feet below the
rim I mean he was at treetop but he was
[SPEAKER_08]: flying up the canyon and I just stood
there and the sonic room was massive and
[SPEAKER_08]: At the end of the canyon.
[SPEAKER_08]: He just gunned it and shot straight up and
out and I was like, wow so they were That
[SPEAKER_08]: they were doing training.
[SPEAKER_08]: I I believe you know because the Russians
were invading Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep around that period place to fly around
like Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they were doing lots of desert
training.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah Practicing parachuting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, do you know the definition of using a
parachute now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what that definition is?
[SPEAKER_05]: So Jim's parachute to get out might mean a
little different now You ever done a
[SPEAKER_10]: parachute jump Australia yeah living down
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I did one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's another story.
[SPEAKER_10]: How long did you live in Australia a year?
[SPEAKER_10]: In Australia and a year in New Zealand
each and another year in South America and
[SPEAKER_10]: then some time in Southeast Asia after BBC
Sorry, mate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that all for the BBC?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that was No, it was afterwards.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh After Jim and I had our adventure.
[SPEAKER_10]: I came to live in Taos.
[SPEAKER_10]: I built a house up here I sold it and then
I sailed across the Pacific Wow Yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: what a life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah kind of I mean, that's my dream
and sailing and just getting out just
[SPEAKER_10]: doing it, you know Yeah, well,
there's a friend of mine just sailed from
[SPEAKER_10]: Cabo st.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lucas to Tahiti And that's hard work
though, you know blue You know the islands
[SPEAKER_10]: of the great thing, you know, yeah the
sailings fun, but it's exhausting do you
[SPEAKER_10]: never sleep probably and you know on a
small boat Yeah, we were had a 57 foot
[SPEAKER_10]: Catch I think that we were on you know,
and you're just crewing all the time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, you get a few hours Kip as
they say where I come from and then
[SPEAKER_10]: somebody bashes on the on the on the hatch
for you to come and help brief the sales
[SPEAKER_10]: of me anyway, so I said but it was a great
adventure wonderful adventure all the way
[SPEAKER_10]: down through Tahiti and Tonga and
Rarotonga all the Cook Islands they're
[SPEAKER_10]: called and but yeah, I lived down in New
Zealand in Australia and and just wondered
[SPEAKER_10]: around You know and found work in the
films while I was there worked on a Worked
[SPEAKER_10]: on a film in in Buenos Aires when I was
over that way Wow Remember the Highlander
[SPEAKER_10]: series with oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah that we did the second one down there
That's cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah in Buenos Aires great city.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lovely lovely town people are loyal to the
Highlander series.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah Yeah one of my guys I'm a location
manager You know, and so I have a crew
[SPEAKER_10]: obviously I work here in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still working.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing a thing for It's one of their
films.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, why don't they want to do a Matt
Jag film?
[SPEAKER_10]: They're getting a book those boys.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know the the assistants I'm gonna give
him a book.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's the story like I think of
all this all the stories I've seen on on
[SPEAKER_05]: the history of the the genesis of this
scene of the cannabis scene and Since I've
[SPEAKER_05]: had mad jag on on these these have been
the most popular shows we've ever done
[SPEAKER_05]: like by a large portion So I know that at
least our and this is a niche type thing
[SPEAKER_05]: to be this far into genetics and breeding
and strains but we have a pretty good size
[SPEAKER_05]: audience for that and Man the amount that
they've tuned into just this story Tells
[SPEAKER_05]: me that like that's something that people
at Netflix should probably take interest
[SPEAKER_05]: in personally like I know I would be super
into seeing that, you know Yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, obviously that's my hope as well
You know, I just would like to get the
[SPEAKER_10]: story out there before I'm too bloody old,
you know can't can't do much more but
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah, and I Think obviously there's a
there's a certain obviously with the way
[SPEAKER_10]: it's suddenly in a sense could become
illegalized at least since Colorado
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado was the first I think right
California and then Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't no no and maybe Colorado went I
thought it was Colorado.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they went fully legal first.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they were ten years ago now Yeah,
so so with the you know, I mean in a sense
[SPEAKER_10]: and this is what I say, you know when when
Jim and I were doing it and Back in those
[SPEAKER_10]: days, obviously, you know, I come from a
pretty straight family, you know farming
[SPEAKER_10]: stock and my brothers and sisters who are
teachers and business folk, you know Even
[SPEAKER_10]: now they're appalled that I did something
So so so radical and days that awesome
[SPEAKER_03]: though What's that isn't that awesome
though like to be the one person in your
[SPEAKER_03]: family who's like the Awesome shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was always the black sheep, you know,
yeah the same here, you know Yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: they even now they would they would they
just a drug dealer, you know, yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah, yeah, you know and yet That's what I
love about this legalization that we have
[SPEAKER_10]: in a sense.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were vindicated we were We were
modern-day moonshiners, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: we were doing just what the guys still do
in Kentucky and places I got absolutely,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, and and yeah, that's I would
like to think the story and there are a
[SPEAKER_10]: few Marijuana stories out there or
smuggling stories, you know, there's the
[SPEAKER_05]: well blow, you know, what is oh,
yeah He just recently passed rest in peace
[SPEAKER_05]: Boston George.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, did he really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, unfortunately, and that's cocaine
which in my view is a stupid drug He
[SPEAKER_05]: started on camp In Manhattan Beach as a
cannabis dealer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I mean Cocaine in my view is an
absolutely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you know an ego drug What make ego
drug?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you feel like God for 20 minutes and
then you need another no, it's Yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: but marijuana is I don't know I don't go
on too much, but I think it's You know
[SPEAKER_10]: Colorado and all the other states have
proven that the system didn't collapse not
[SPEAKER_10]: everybody's crashing into each other on
the freeway Christ I remember driving
[SPEAKER_10]: stoned, you know, you do it 25 You drive
extra safe So, you know and how many
[SPEAKER_10]: people have how many alcohol these are all
cliches but you're seen so many alcoholics
[SPEAKER_10]: in my time and and No, it's it's it's
proven that it's Essentially on this but
[SPEAKER_10]: but on that note I would also say and stop
me if I'm talking too much but on that
[SPEAKER_10]: note is that we should we shouldn't think
of it as the panacea, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: when we do need to be careful of it
because the way you guys You know the way
[SPEAKER_10]: the modern growers are doing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do we have Jim?
[SPEAKER_10]: What percentage do THC did we have in the
parts of 8 to 12 roughly if you're lucky,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's it now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Some say up to 35 36 40 somewhere in there
Four times as powerful, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's just the weed not even the
extract extracts are at 90 now 99,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know exactly and somebody taking that
for the first time and getting behind the
[SPEAKER_10]: wheel or Yeah, that would really really
screw someone up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, bloody dangerous, you know,
we can and and I think there are certain
[SPEAKER_10]: also medical Mental issues with it as
well.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah some people can't quite handle it,
you know There were there were a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: years where I could not smoke with That it
triggering anxiety depression anything
[SPEAKER_05]: like that and and it was just one of those
things I had to get used to as far as Like
[SPEAKER_05]: come to the conclusion like my hormones in
my body change as I'm as I get older I
[SPEAKER_05]: can't smoke like I used to at least during
those years I could it's changed again for
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever reason I can smoke non-stop and
not have that but during those years It
[SPEAKER_05]: was really really triggering stuff and it
was not a good time for me to be using it
[SPEAKER_05]: only triggered and made it worse So yeah,
it's definitely not that the cure-all I
[SPEAKER_05]: see I see CBD stores everywhere in
California now not just Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean in gas stations are selling CBD
oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're selling CBD CBD joints,
you know CBD everything Delta 8 Delta 10
[SPEAKER_05]: specifically what you're extracted from
hemp And a lot of people don't know that
[SPEAKER_05]: the other day I was in a cigarette store
and I about because I get pretty autistic
[SPEAKER_05]: with this stuff like when I hear
misinformation It makes my face turn red,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially if it's something I'm very
passionate About and this this lady was I
[SPEAKER_05]: was waiting to get vape stuff right at the
vape It was a vape cigarette store and
[SPEAKER_05]: they sell cigarettes and and CBD and
everything there and I was listening this
[SPEAKER_05]: lady She was trying to get real advice
real medical advice from a cigarette store
[SPEAKER_05]: guy right on on what she should be using
He's like well, you know Delta 8 Delta 9
[SPEAKER_05]: Delta 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all made from sativa So you're
pretty safe there and I was just like Why
[SPEAKER_05]: why are you just making it up?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you telling this lady?
[SPEAKER_05]: medical advice, you know, like just sativa
might mean one thing to her and Whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: she's taking might completely trigger the
opposite effect and it could be a really
[SPEAKER_05]: bad Bad situation experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: She may never try cannabis again,
you know It may be such a negative
[SPEAKER_05]: experience and then you and then and then
it's all because someone gave her bad info
[SPEAKER_05]: You know and and that that ruins it for
her for good So yeah, it's just constant
[SPEAKER_05]: around here and and a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're selling Chinese sourced CBD and a
lot of people don't know the Chinese
[SPEAKER_05]: government Was paying their people to grow
hemp?
[SPEAKER_05]: In mass to leach toxins from the soil in
China So a lot of these were these hemp
[SPEAKER_05]: hemp plants were grown to leach toxins
from the soil They're using that sending
[SPEAKER_05]: it over here in mass to use for a CBD
market for extraction now I don't I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: know that those metals make it in I don't
know but That's not what people think
[SPEAKER_05]: they're getting they don't understand that
and it's 99% of the CBD stuff and gas
[SPEAKER_05]: stations is that Chinese sourced CBD You
know, right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah Let's start again.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say that you know to get back to
this the the sort of increased strength of
[SPEAKER_10]: it now is real and you know, I don't think
that Impressionable teenagers should
[SPEAKER_10]: should know, you know take in too much of
this or you know, maybe you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Proven it affects it affects under
the under undeveloped brains right can
[SPEAKER_05]: cause What was it called emotional arrest
meaning like a lot of people that start
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking when they're 12 Emotionally tend
to stay around that age emotionally,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know that tends to happen and it's not
always it's not everyone so it's not like
[SPEAKER_05]: a Blanket statement, but it can happen and
so yeah, like it that was one of my things
[SPEAKER_05]: growing up I had a younger I have two
younger brothers and I I was very
[SPEAKER_05]: Cognizant that one of my brothers was
already smoking pot and I didn't want him
[SPEAKER_05]: to think that I was an advocate
necessarily of it knowing what I did so I
[SPEAKER_05]: Had hide what I did for a living for a
long time from him and you know as he got
[SPEAKER_05]: older He thought yeah, you're an idiot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like why don't you do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was already smoking but at the same
time I didn't want him to think that I was
[SPEAKER_05]: Telling him that this is what he should be
doing that I think this is cool because I
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't and he's you know I mean,
I'm sure he's he's felt effects from it as
[SPEAKER_10]: he's gotten older Yeah, I'm still a 12
year old so you know same with whether you
[SPEAKER_10]: agree that boo should be restricted to 21
or 18 or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's it's the same In a sense,
you should be mature before you make that
[SPEAKER_10]: decision.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, I think there's a lot of you
know jumping on the bandwagon now about
[SPEAKER_10]: weed and CBD and And I think we need to be
cautious as well because it is a strong
[SPEAKER_10]: drug.
[SPEAKER_10]: No doubt about it I when I first tried
some of these edibles, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: thank you much.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was Sprawled out for six hours rolling.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, what's that drooling?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they've made me drool.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've made me drool before Marijuana in
the day, you know, and yeah Yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so we got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I think you know, and you know
They sell this stuff for dogs to like the
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD oil and it reminds me of when the mic
when me and my chick met She wasn't
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: She smoked a lot when she was young,
but she hadn't smoked for years And I was
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you know, my friend sent me some CBD
oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: She had some back pain I was like,
let's try this but she hadn't had any THC
[SPEAKER_05]: in years then there was a negligible
amount of THC and some of these CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: extracts and people don't realize that
because it's not done very carefully with
[SPEAKER_05]: some sellers and She took it and she went
to hell for at least like, you know 12
[SPEAKER_05]: hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was in THC hell, you know and and and
it was a negligible amount, but it's just
[SPEAKER_05]: because it affected her so much She's not
used to it and all of a sudden BAM.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's taking a an extracted amount even
though it was small It's extracted.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, yeah, it's it and that could
have given this to their dogs people Are
[SPEAKER_05]: giving this to their kids and they have no
clue no clue that that can happen Hey,
[SPEAKER_08]: they're mixing LSD with with weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that right?
[SPEAKER_05]: How are they doing that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't smoke that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember your story now In the 1980s I
there was a number of people who still
[SPEAKER_08]: believe that no I bet when they first
smoked weed that was kind of psychedelic
[SPEAKER_08]: and they I one of my mad jag chronicles is
about a Rastafarian I know in Brooklyn and
[SPEAKER_08]: he sent us out of his house after he had
two puffs of skunk number one and and the
[SPEAKER_08]: next day told me was very mad that I had
given him some LSD in and he had never
[SPEAKER_08]: smoked anything that powerful he was a
super Rastafarian and When we were gone,
[SPEAKER_08]: he told us later the job didn't place for
20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had so much energy He didn't know what
to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he just ran in place
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great, I'll bet there's still some
people out in the farm somewhere that
[SPEAKER_08]: believe there's LSD could be put Oh,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean look at the the fentanyl craze
lately I mean you see this with the the
[SPEAKER_05]: police officers saying that they're
absorbing fentanyl through their fingers
[SPEAKER_05]: from powder and like passing out
everywhere like people that know like you
[SPEAKER_05]: can't absorb Fentanyl through your fingers
unless it's got like some kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: transtorable jail DMS DMS Oh, it doesn't
absorb that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and and even being a foot away and
in healing a microscopic amount of powder
[SPEAKER_05]: of fentanyl isn't gonna kill you or nor
need Narcan so it's it's it's we see this
[SPEAKER_05]: today with with the And granted fentanyl
is dangerous as hell.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean people shouldn't be taking this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's unregulated It's you know coming
from China.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't take it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please people not saying you should take
it but It's also the it's like the satanic
[SPEAKER_05]: panic of the 80s to me where there's so
much misinformation is coming out with
[SPEAKER_05]: these drugs that people are experiencing
these psychosomatic effects And it helps
[SPEAKER_05]: spread more fear now now the cops are
passing out They're so terrified to work
[SPEAKER_05]: with fentanyl and and do these fentanyl
arrests They're passing out in fear and
[SPEAKER_05]: and blaming it on overdosing and all this
crazy shit and it's causing more fear and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just yeah fear the unknown is is
something the crack the crack epidemics
[SPEAKER_08]: exactly similar.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely definitely Yeah So did
you guys ever think you would be
[SPEAKER_05]: pioneering an industry that became a
multi-billion dollar?
[SPEAKER_05]: industry That's what I want to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you ever once think that you were
pioneering changing anything?
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, no, no, we were just filling us,
you know filling a need in a way and
[SPEAKER_10]: there's a guy who lives in Costa Rica,
but he lived up here and Taos for many
[SPEAKER_10]: years and he started to talk to me Jim
knows the story and he said yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, we said we just sort of got on
the weed and he said I lived in I think it
[SPEAKER_10]: was Wisconsin and they said I drove down
to Arizona once and fetched this weed that
[SPEAKER_10]: somebody was selling got it was the best
you'd ever had and I said, oh,
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah, what was it calling?
[SPEAKER_10]: He said oh, it's the mad jag these guys
with the labels and We could we got it
[SPEAKER_10]: back to Chicago and it was gone in a few
hours anyway, so so we were just you know
[SPEAKER_10]: We would moonshine us, you know,
we were providing an illicit product for A
[SPEAKER_10]: market that demanded it right and and and
we were in the early days again.
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about it earlier So,
you know, we it was the methods that Jim
[SPEAKER_10]: had learned and taught me, you know I mean
what did I know and you know how to how to
[SPEAKER_10]: pull the miles how to how to Get your
product Superb we were very careful and
[SPEAKER_10]: especially obviously those three or four
days, you know We and we we had to dry it
[SPEAKER_10]: down in the can you know and yeah We
didn't have a cellar or a barn or
[SPEAKER_10]: something.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we which strung lots of lines into the
most shady parts of the of the Creekside
[SPEAKER_10]: trees.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and And mate, you know, we would
took great pride in our product if you
[SPEAKER_10]: will and and Jim sent something into High
times he sent some buds into high times
[SPEAKER_10]: Jim on that other site.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you recognize?
[SPEAKER_10]: Recommended that I put the book up IC mag,
you know that one Matt, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep There was a little conversation I'll
send you the link if you're interested the
[SPEAKER_10]: first it's a chapter of the book up on
that one on IC mag and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that your competition?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, yeah, definitely take it out Anyway,
you know, we got a great ride up somebody
[SPEAKER_10]: dug up the guy was saying skunk That
wasn't you know, nobody had heard a skunk
[SPEAKER_10]: until the 90s or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was trying I said, well, no We had it
back in 1980 anyway, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: we were yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, did we think of course it wasn't gonna
Grow into this industry that it is now,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, obviously we didn't know it's
gonna be legal ever right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, it's just maybe close it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know Jim Jim's would say but it
was there were a couple things it was the
[SPEAKER_10]: adventure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was the The the the the snot
what's the word tipping your nose at
[SPEAKER_10]: authority and yeah that that was part of
it, you know and And the excellent seed
[SPEAKER_10]: that we had that grew this marvelous the
skunk was one thing I've never been that
[SPEAKER_10]: fond of that, you know, I like this that's
Tiva was so yeah, so Energizing,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, and as I say we'd smoke it in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: I what you know, we'll just be lying
around or wasting a day But no you you
[SPEAKER_10]: could get out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I don't know Yeah, could fully
operate in a job.
[SPEAKER_10]: I said Smoke marijuana and be any good on
a film set.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I could certainly You know run
around and chase a ball and I'll play
[SPEAKER_10]: tennis I remember when I lived in LA we
would go playing paddle tennis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, you know, I I do all these sober
myself I can't I can never do an interview
[SPEAKER_05]: stone not even a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, my memory call sucks during any time
When I'm even a little bit stoned,
[SPEAKER_05]: so I've done every single one of these
completely sober.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's weird Yeah, no, it has that
dissociative quality to it that is the
[SPEAKER_10]: word I was you know, you It's perfect for
so yeah hiking or making love.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there are things good for and there
are things that it's lousy for you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: and In the garden working outside in the
garden, yeah, you know doing physical
[SPEAKER_10]: things but but holding a conversation
about Proust or you know, yeah You know,
[SPEAKER_10]: you're not gonna hold it up and let's you
know, in fact, I remember recording in you
[SPEAKER_10]: know in my mind Conversations that I had
when I was in Jerome with people and you
[SPEAKER_10]: know, a lot of them were just very
digressive very you know Nobody you don't
[SPEAKER_10]: stay on track.
[SPEAKER_10]: So well it Yeah, it's it's the same as a
lot of dogs, you know, you should take
[SPEAKER_10]: them recreationally and enjoy it for that
You know just like being in the pub and
[SPEAKER_10]: drinking three or four pints by the end
you're full of Life and joking and yeah
[SPEAKER_10]: morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: You feel like shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly Marijuana doesn't seem to
have quite the same hangover.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing like it once you're used to it
Yeah, no, especially not once you're used
[SPEAKER_05]: to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember early on being like feeling
like I was dragging a bit the next day,
[SPEAKER_05]: but That went away so fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is so fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well edibles Yeah, well, that's a
different story.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had that I've had that lag days days
upon some of the Malawi cobs I've made and
[SPEAKER_08]: You the next day you wake up and you're
still as high as you were the day Yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: that's that cob you gave me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: He says take a piece these sizes I mean,
this is a only about five or six years ago
[SPEAKER_10]: and my way up somewhere to work and I
think I stopped in Durango night And talk
[SPEAKER_10]: about being absolutely blitzed for the
evening barely able to order a meal let
[SPEAKER_10]: alone hold a conversation And then stone
as a dog the next morning to You know
[SPEAKER_10]: driving through the mountains and going I
am stoned Twelve hours later.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's them in downtown LA.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah Yeah, imagine on the freeway or
something Yeah, you know at 80 miles an
[SPEAKER_10]: hour God.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, or you know lie you ten miles in
Well, is there anything else you want to
[SPEAKER_05]: get in Jim?
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really it's Johnny's covered a good
portion and like he was saying if you go
[SPEAKER_08]: to that other Website the other foot
almost means I I went I went over last
[SPEAKER_08]: week and posted a copy of the Robert
Clark's handwritten Envelope that the
[SPEAKER_08]: seeds came in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow, so that he could see that,
you know, he put for the for the night
[SPEAKER_08]: 1981 season.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah made in 1980 that one, you know,
and yeah, yeah, and I posted some thoughts
[SPEAKER_08]: about that also was that it was odd that
They used the the front of the label said,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know Hash plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah pure afghan.
[SPEAKER_05]: It said repeatedly on that label pure
afghan unhybridized.
[SPEAKER_08]: I It made me wonder if maybe they started
with afghan number one And it was before
[SPEAKER_08]: skunk number one or they were planning on
releasing these labels with skunk number I
[SPEAKER_08]: mean with afghan number one, but people
said oh, no, the skunk number one's way
[SPEAKER_08]: better way better So then they switched
and he he sold skunk number one I think
[SPEAKER_05]: labels printed up and then they realized
oh my god, we have multiple strains,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we have these nice labels Let's just
use the label and put that on the back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah Yeah, and also There's there's so
much detail that we both know From like
[SPEAKER_08]: even the Jerome days when we were growing
and we were so our first year We did quite
[SPEAKER_08]: well good enough so that we didn't have to
work for two dollars An hour which we did
[SPEAKER_08]: the year before just to get by yeah,
and It also allowed me the money to buy
[SPEAKER_08]: 3000 skunk number one seed exactly I have
to say thank you to high times because
[SPEAKER_08]: that's how I found Robert Clark Great
reading some of his articles in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I wrote to the to the I wrote to him
via high times They said if you want to
[SPEAKER_08]: talk to the author or whatever and then he
he wrote me directly or somehow we
[SPEAKER_08]: connected and it was um, I Realized then
that by having the most potent most famous
[SPEAKER_08]: seed At that time it would be up to our
benefit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, because no one had brought skunk
to Arizona yet Yeah to New York City or
[SPEAKER_08]: Brooklyn and it turned out to be Very
worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so new at that point It was such
skunk was so new when you guys got hold of
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys were some of the biggest First
guys growing it in that in that size for
[SPEAKER_05]: sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and we pulled it off So that made it
even better I made history All right guys,
[SPEAKER_05]: but this is this is an amazing
conversation Is there anything else you
[SPEAKER_05]: want to get in Johnny?
[SPEAKER_10]: Just looking back I you know Jim and I
still Still we went period to him,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know when I went my way and he went
his but it's been It was the adventure of
[SPEAKER_10]: my life.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was and if I may have had a few,
you know and and that was it was a
[SPEAKER_10]: Fabulous time and I'm always grateful to
Jim for Sort of mentoring me through it,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know because so many people,
you know, I've thousands obviously tens of
[SPEAKER_10]: thousands of people have grown weed Since
you know in dodgy spots and a lot of them
[SPEAKER_10]: fail, you know, I mean I bet there's a
Tremendous attrition rate.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah alia, you know, you know
everybody starts out all full of
[SPEAKER_10]: enthusiasm and goes out and cuts holes
into Manzanita, you know, yeah thickets
[SPEAKER_10]: and They don't make it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I wanted to just thank that,
you know, Jim was the Jim was the man and
[SPEAKER_10]: I really for the first year anyway,
I was just just the work in Stiff,
[SPEAKER_10]: but it was a fabulous adventure and and
I'll never regret it.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I mean and and and again we've sort of
covered it but it's nice to have this
[SPEAKER_10]: vindication now all these years later that
you know that marijuana hasn't as You know
[SPEAKER_10]: most of the Republican senators in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it'll be the death of Colorado and
everybody's gonna be smashing into each
[SPEAKER_10]: other and and sprawling out on the streets
and you know and The and what I the other
[SPEAKER_10]: thing I'd like to point out which is
something that gets me very strongly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm an American citizen now, but You know
this this this this prison system that we
[SPEAKER_10]: have in this country is a pardon me It's a
fucking disaster in my view and the number
[SPEAKER_10]: of people that are languishing in jail for
god knows how long for sitting on the
[SPEAKER_10]: porch and smoking a reefer in the evening
like Anybody else has a glass of scotch or
[SPEAKER_10]: a beer, you know is absolutely and it's an
indictment of the privatized Prison system
[SPEAKER_10]: we have in this country, which is which is
an absolute travesty of justice,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: There was slavery to me It is slavery and
all the and all the corporations these
[SPEAKER_10]: ugly Corporations that that set up these
awful prisons and like Jim where Jim's got
[SPEAKER_10]: a lovely place up in northern New Mexico
that I've visited in a lot and right
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a little town called Clayton close
by and it's classic of what sorry,
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to go too much about this,
but you asked me and you know this this
[SPEAKER_10]: This system where that we the taxpayer pay
these corporations to put people in jail
[SPEAKER_10]: and they build them in these shitty
run-down little towns like this one's
[SPEAKER_10]: Clayton where there's no Business no,
you know, it's a dying town.
[SPEAKER_10]: So all the people end up working as guards
or cooks or whatever Anyway, and it drives
[SPEAKER_05]: the whole town and and without the
privatized prison then you're driving the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole town out of money becomes its own
problem, right and and the city fathers
[SPEAKER_10]: kiss the ass of the Exactly people who run
it because it's the only trade they've got
[SPEAKER_10]: but but it's driven and how many people
are in there for nonviolent crimes,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know Victimless crimes the whole drug
thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the DEA, you know, we were always
joking Halfheartedly or in a sense about
[SPEAKER_10]: getting caught by the DEA that that that
entire war against drugs is Proved to be
[SPEAKER_10]: an absolute complete fucking waste of
taxpayers millions of dollars wasted
[SPEAKER_10]: billions of dollars money trillions Yeah,
and people's lives so many lives ruined
[SPEAKER_10]: and they still are, you know with the the
violence in Mexico and It's appalling to
[SPEAKER_10]: me that we go on in this country,
you know Financing this stupid fight on
[SPEAKER_10]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas, you know if we're Least had some
more sensible approach and policies for it
[SPEAKER_10]: in America.
[SPEAKER_10]: There wouldn't be the Terrible violence on
the border.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that's my only concern too is is
that Legalization only brings those
[SPEAKER_05]: assholes in the corporate sector into
cannabis to bastardize it more and ruin it
[SPEAKER_05]: from the inside out That's my biggest
concern, but it almost seems inevitable
[SPEAKER_05]: because that's what they do and then you
just take it back Yeah, you know At least
[SPEAKER_10]: at least it's you don't go to jail for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like the one the end user can enjoy
a calming Yeah, I would say you know
[SPEAKER_10]: pleasant evening without having to worry
about You know sure what when his door
[SPEAKER_10]: broken down and being thrown in jail,
you know I mean I think at one point there
[SPEAKER_10]: was something like 50% of the you know of
the incarcerated population Was in there
[SPEAKER_10]: for drugs nonviolent and victimless crimes
Yeah, just because these goddamn
[SPEAKER_10]: corporations then they lobby of course for
more draconian laws.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh sure Yeah, so so it's a it's a it's a
dreadful system.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, you asked me for a last comment.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's perfect My last comment it is that
Johnny has climbed half dome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh Shit half dome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I Can tell from that shape you guys
wouldn't have a problem climbing half dome
[SPEAKER_10]: at all back then not back there and I
don't know about now Yeah, my climbing

[SPEAKER_10]: anyway, I've got vertigo now.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't my climbing days are done.
