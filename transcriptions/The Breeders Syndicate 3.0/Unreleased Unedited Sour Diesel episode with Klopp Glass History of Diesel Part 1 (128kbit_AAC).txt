[SPEAKER_02]: I make you have to do things multiple
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna go ahead and hit record and then
Gabby jumps in to redo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was going to Woodstock back in
the 90s upstate New York and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm not gonna do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I gonna go see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bands that I've seen and ones that I don't
wanna see and I don't really wanna camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not into the camping scene so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I book a ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: To Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go and I'm there, I don't know,
three days, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do all the museums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just do all the museums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to the smoke shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to the grasshopper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, wow, this is some really nice
stuff here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were telling me that they got all
the stuff was from Sensei Seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go over to the, I was there to get
seeds anyway, but so I go over and buy
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pick out the Hawaiian, the Northern
Lights, the Oasis, Big Bud, Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Lights times five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need the Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have that already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the RFK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running the number one and the number
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number three got squashed right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do too many strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys talked about the RFK earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number three was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't the nicest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one and the two were the nicest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was, oh, and I bought a
Durbin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had these strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came back to get them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut all the bags that they came in or
pouches I bought and I sealed them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little tiny triangle bags, each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wrote on it with a magic marker what
it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had all the strains and they all
stacked up about I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: size of a quarter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took them and I strapped them to Peter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the bottom side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what they all are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I purchased these seeds,
I was looking at them and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they look like when you get them from
the magazine, they were stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uniform and stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go to the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not feeling well,
but I smoked a big fat fucking joint in
[SPEAKER_00]: the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't believe you were allowed to
smoke in Amsterdam at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had to be mind blowing, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was because that's why I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was so fucked up that I wasn't
feeling well on the flight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't fill out my paperwork correctly
and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm coming through the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm filling it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dog sat down next to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, hey, what's up, dog?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fucking beagle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, my heart fucking fell to the
floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I get up to the front and go
through my luggage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking just tore it apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, come with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go into a room, 10 by 10, and they
stripped me down,
[SPEAKER_00]: stripped me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a thing that we thought you was
smuggling heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, buddy, I got to go to the
bathroom right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can have my stool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He puts his hand on my heart and it's
racing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, why is your heart racing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, you make me nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm in my underwear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in a weird place with cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weird place, and you got a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me nervous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you make me fucking nervous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, he goes, all right,
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I got dressed so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got in the cab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like, getting in a cab was such
a relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get home and I was just like,
oh, passed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had them now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had all these strains from the Sensei
Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you worry that because of your
experience there and the idea that they
[SPEAKER_02]: had that you might be smuggling heroin,
that they might be watching your spot
[SPEAKER_02]: after?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they probably were looking at me
because I had a stamp on my passport
[SPEAKER_00]: already from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a whole Jamaica incident.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not a fun time spending time in
Spanish town.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, can you talk about it a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is right after I met my
buddy that game.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Staten Island, I should recall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, yeah, we go to Jamaica,
make some money, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I don't know this guy here and
he didn't come with me, but there was
[SPEAKER_00]: another guy from the neighborhood,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got popped and I spent a little time in
Spanish town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Montego Bay first and then going to
Spanish town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't they don't mess around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thirteen days was enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that'll set you a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like the facilities were so
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: People talk about third world jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you right now, you're sleeping on
concrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have open latrines on the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that means, oh, you have no your shoes
or whatever you're wearing is tracking
[SPEAKER_00]: fecal matter everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Including where you sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you sleep in 20 people and 40 square
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your food ration could be a small
juice box and a rice patty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say that, that's exactly what it
was in Montego Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got a hockey puck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a hockey puck, the rice and a
juice box and maybe some little other
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had no money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you end up getting out of that
situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and then everybody's going to
everybody gets dysentery or you get the
[SPEAKER_00]: shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get dehydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how did I get out of there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on my 13th day and I got to see
the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, when I got there after
after Montego Bay, you go to five hour or
[SPEAKER_00]: four hour drive to King's Kingston.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spanish town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go in a truck and the cell in the
truck is it is on the back of a flat bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's four foot by four foot and you get
two foot by two foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, you couldn't even squat down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting bounced around on the back
of the truck with three other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get to Spanish town,
you talk to the warden and the first thing
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to ask you is hey,
can I do anything for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I contact anybody for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can contact my sister.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had already got my my bond or my bail
set at a certain amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, so contact my sister,
tell her to call my mom and cash in a
[SPEAKER_00]: bond.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, nobody would know that I have bond,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy from Jamaica calls my sister
and my sister is like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Calls my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom had to work for a couple of
Jamaicans down in Miami or Fort
[SPEAKER_00]: Lauderdale.
And.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually the same day now I'm 13 days
into it and I go see the American Council.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, I don't think I can do
anything for about five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take time to get back and
forth with people in the States,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, going through the embassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go back to the to the cell with an
open cell area and hanging out with some
[SPEAKER_00]: guys from Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smoke weed in the jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best brown sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one thing you had plenty of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is coffee a brown sugar in jail?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's wild.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like an hour later, I hear my
name being called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked me if it was me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, this is a you're out
of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took everything, you know.
And.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see these two black guys and they
like they're like, come with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the American Embassy lady is
like, you know, these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sit right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't move.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made she made the two guys sit down,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they had to explain that they
were going to understand them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were speaking pot walk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then he took me to the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then they made me sit in the
room and then he put me on an airplane
[SPEAKER_00]: home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So were they just friends of your your
mom's friends?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he was a business guy and he just
had connections in in Kingston.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that was lucky, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was lucky, you know, but I mean,
yeah, I don't know how I was described,
[SPEAKER_00]: but fucking stepping in shit on that on
the way home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's who you know, sometimes do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sometimes life is just like that and
you get lucky because that it yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not the first time that's
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean, going down the line,
it happened in the future again with luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that so that's about the time that you
started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that about the time you met?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby or Gabby?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to hear the story of how you met
him from your point of view because he
[SPEAKER_00]: told his point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's a great story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's how everybody has this
perspective and exactly what you remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because yeah, it was so.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another member, so I'm just
shows with a night before in the garden
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm fucking I sit outside in the sun
on on my steps in the back of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy, this hippie walks by and he
says hi, you know, peace sign right back.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just laughed, you know, because I
was kind of still a little bit tripping,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: He comes over, he goes, hey, you were
playing the LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yeah, dude, speaking my
language.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bought some of them and because,
hey, I have my two friends are over here
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out and we really need a place to
hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you mind coming let us hang out?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like we were at the shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I was at the shows,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take me over to your friends, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you walk over and there's this guy and
this and this girl, they're sitting on the
[SPEAKER_00]: curb.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the side of a busy road, like buses go
by, double lane, you know, it's like and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's Gabby and it's Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were smoking a joint,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think they were smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I introduced myself and it's like,
hey, come on, let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they hung out for like three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are going to leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You made best friends for life,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but in those three days,
OK, yeah, I trusted them because I went to
[SPEAKER_00]: work and I came back and my stuff was
still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I trust them and I built a friendship
with them right there on the spot,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did have some good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, he's got the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that always helps, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great way to make an introduction
is bring the best weed.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you met Gabby, what exactly were
you growing at the time or had you not
[SPEAKER_02]: started growing yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I had always and only grown outdoors
at the time, at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like I wasn't doing it year to
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first time was actually back in the
early 80s, like 84.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my brother-in-law and I had done some
small Hindu cushions that he had in his
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first time I had ever been
introduced to growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't go well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because somebody robbed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I would try in the woods and hide
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some stuff.
Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would get some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then nothing really took off until I
met Gabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, yeah, this is indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow it indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got my wheels ticking now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he goes out, does his thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He told me, I think you might have been
going to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a time when we didn't make it in
our band burned on fire, just for
[SPEAKER_01]: reference to people that we told the story
to before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, the clique that I'm hanging out
with, we decided to go into the city.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you know what, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to go to this store in the city
over in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, was it 14th Street area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to go to the bookstore and
search for books on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a book by Jack's book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I read the fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started doing my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't have the proper lights like
Scott and I don't talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I hung up these florescence in an
eight foot long closet or a six foot long
[SPEAKER_00]: closet by two foot deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every day I would move the lights up
about a half inch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept them right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing the fucking jig with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of the labor of love.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I got that first crop and all the
people that went to the bookstore with me
[SPEAKER_00]: and laughed about what all you're going to
do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't get anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're wasting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got that first crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was impressed myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, wow, these are nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it was just like bag seed from
shit weed, but it was better than what I
[SPEAKER_00]: was getting from the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finally, he also had this little plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the Francine?
[SPEAKER_00]: That little Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember that little tiny Afghani?
Gabby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Francine, was it the, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first plant that you ever brought over
to my house who brought me this cotton,
[SPEAKER_00]: this little Afghani plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your friend Lou gave it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely wasn't that because I popped
the seed with myself afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was like, that was a cool little
plant that he brought over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used that and I crossed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I crossed it purposely,
but I got seeds off it and I used those
[SPEAKER_00]: and I planted those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't come out good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to toss them because they're Hermes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were in Washington at the show
and he talks about the bag that we got the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember who scored the bag,
but we did fight over the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the RFK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We argued over the seeds and I confiscated
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been a strain that I've been
researching for a long time because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's not a lot of info out there about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember the first time I heard
about it was it was supposedly in this
[SPEAKER_02]: line called DNL and it was supposedly RFK
skunk Hawaiian Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's correct, but is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hawaiian wouldn't be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somebody who's growing the weed from
that I got it from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there was a sweet version and
there was a version that was very hashy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And had beautiful structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess if it was going to call it
Hawaiian, more the sativa looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kind of short and bushy though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't grow really tall like the
Hawaiian that I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has a complete different structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: When was the last time you were growing
any of the RFKs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say soon after I came back with
the seeds from Amsterdam, I discontinued
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, this is out of the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are a problem to begin with because
they hermed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want them in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even in fact, when I was
wondering, when I got the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: originally, they had the little bananas on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we would call them bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you kind of knew and then the seeds
were there, but you used them because this
[SPEAKER_00]: is what you had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You weren't going to be growing males,
so you used what you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember if you said one was hashy
and was either really skunky?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were both skunky.
Definitely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For their area, that would be skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like I had pictures of them at one
time and then, you know, you lose things
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to contest that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the beginning, I was kind of like
thrilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually think you took the photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had taken the photos and given them to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were they of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the RFK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that anymore.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Snapshot captured in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost everything in the fires.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those stories that I've
changed for a long time and I didn't even
[SPEAKER_02]: know it made its way back to you,
which is really cool that we finally have
[SPEAKER_02]: some answers on it, what it was,
what it was like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I had three of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And three of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have some friends in Virginia
that picked up and they're old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if you know the the far away from
Virginia, the cut that was going around
[SPEAKER_02]: East Coast, you've made with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty popular, at least in
Virginia, and they were the crew that
[SPEAKER_02]: popped those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of their friends has this old cut
of something they called RFK, but it may
[SPEAKER_02]: not even be the same ones you had.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just funny that we called
it that because we didn't know what to
[SPEAKER_00]: call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the initials from the stadium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some other stuff here down.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get into some of the diesel
stuff, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the the Genesis and the reason
for the name of sour diesel?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I really didn't I didn't name
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe named it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so like and he's always says it's
because it's soured friendships.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did sour friendships and even a
chem book, soured friendships.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even any strain that you were holding
because the person that you got it from,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, like chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to give this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I'm trying to hold word with this
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this person over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like and then after a while,
you break down anyway and you go for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's sour in your friendship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And did you guys call it diesel
originally?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't even know what to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just that that's the Albany crew that
came up with diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's is that Joe's crew, Albany crew?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would guess, yeah, him, Bondo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maxwell.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I remember those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys were a lot of was a lot of fun
in the deck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you tell me, Matt, that Bondo was
taking credit for it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Bondo had said that the bag didn't
say sour on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It said our diesel on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone wrote an S on it as a joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it became sour diesel after that joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have no clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's his again, that's his
perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: His memory perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason it worked is because we
were all there at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why was there?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one that's that's really puzzled
me for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Early on, there was confusion that the
sour or the diesel rather was a Chem 91
[SPEAKER_02]: clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the Chem 91 cut renamed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was confusion that it might
be a Chem 91 S1 bag seed pure Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: And later on, it became more of a super
skunk hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think seems more accurate to you from
your perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want you to feel like you're held
down to saying it is for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to ask you to repeat that back.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so early on, people I don't even know
if it was early on in my experience when I
[SPEAKER_02]: came into the scene around 2006,
2008.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that region, people were saying that
diesel was a Chem 91 clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so stop right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'm already out of the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out of the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what people were doing, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I didn't even dabble because
I was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now.
[SPEAKER_00]: 209 is.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'm free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can do what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm starting to come back and do my
little bit of outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can only do outdoor and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't have a spot indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my life has completely changed at this
scene, at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am now working, doing back what I used
to do before I started growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a whole new career and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's 213 is really when I can do what
I want to do outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start my freedom program all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a cut of the sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some genetics from.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's out in Ohio, but I like his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got dreads.
He's black.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, candy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, green something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have T-shirts and I don't even have a
second here, you know, but I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: spoken to him in years, you know,
like people would just people would just
[SPEAKER_00]: text me and.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would even just fucking walk up to
me sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you got any seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you got.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh, I bet, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm like, I look like I don't know
what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because my life has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to hide, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been working on it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: My 10th year again, straight working on
making seeds just for myself for a year to
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave out some.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once in a while, you get a few in your
weed if you get some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking amazing, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad that you're still doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're back in and you're taking charge of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in my life, I'm not looking
to go into business in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you all the regulations,
the hurdles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the money, the money to get in,
even though I could get a license probably
[SPEAKER_00]: because they they lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, you know, I had to change my whole
life over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got lost over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the worst feeling, too,
again, is when they when they come to your
[SPEAKER_00]: house and you're like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that your girl room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's my.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's why I understand,
like, why a lot of the people that came
[SPEAKER_02]: before me took the choice to go the
corporate route, because a lot of them had
[SPEAKER_02]: PTSD.
[SPEAKER_02]: From being hit and they didn't want to be
hit anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they wanted some kind of safety and to
do their passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I do have like if I have to go back
to a closet or a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't need that much because I don't
really sell it, you know, and I always
[SPEAKER_00]: have a surplus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I give it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you you like you do you're a glass
blower, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that OK to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really like I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get to do as much right now
because I work a full time job and I'm a
[SPEAKER_00]: shop steward in the union.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carpenter's union.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, you know, the pension right now
means more to me than anything in a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the medical for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like who the hell gets medical for
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York City Carpenter's do after a
certain amount of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can keep my head down,
stay clean, you know, do my thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: not get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only have a few more years to go do four
more years and I'm out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the medical is everything because like
as a grower, a lot of people don't realize
[SPEAKER_02]: that like aren't growers and just buy
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no health insurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no retirement for what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I doing what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Jerry always said, keep your day
job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always kind of like bust my balls on
some of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would always say, like, because that's
all they do is grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah, have your day job,
you know, like they're not nobody you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not contributing to Social Security.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get a pension.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an annuity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope the company that you're working
for growing weed is is doing the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing for you, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's going to be it's a hard thing
because there's profit there, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like fine line profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the state's taxing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of that percentage of that,
you know, and yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I even said that like a couple of
years ago, I said every state that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: online, the price of the product comes
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back like two years ago, I said weed is
going to be $150 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's way less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially in Cali.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because you have so many growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need such a large scale to grow,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the state's taking the tax on it,
you know, and then the people rather not
[SPEAKER_00]: pay the tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still going to go to the
underground market and get usually just as
[SPEAKER_00]: good a product or better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that floods the underground
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the prices drop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some people seem to like the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people, for some reason, still think
that they can charge 400 bucks an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: That only lasts so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still less than I still look in and I
like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a lot of mad people
feeling custard when they realize you get
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of rich clientele.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the businessman who goes to
that businessman, they don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like, here, here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would know nothing about rich clientele.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you, I've never had... You
know, like, I mean, even back in the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, for a pound, I was getting it
straight up $400 an ounce, 450 foot of
[SPEAKER_00]: kem, 400 foot of sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to have the underdog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, people, I guess some people say it
was the headband, but I think the headband
[SPEAKER_00]: and the underdog is a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk about each one a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, somebody named it headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: AJ says he named it, me named it headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, OK.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: JJ says the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He named it headband.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they both claim it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was really, first of all,
it was one seed out of 100.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that Northern Lights that I came back
with from Amsterdam, I got 13 seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 13 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just picked the first male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was reading the book and I was like,
all right, I don't want them too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want them too short.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take the middle height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the early flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it says in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get rid of the other males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the only... I was doing other
strains too, but I took the Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Lights and I crossed it into the kem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I used to call that kem lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard that term.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because kem times lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Old school naming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it naturally would be first would be,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't the male supposed to come first?
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes second in the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kem lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I did name it right.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took that and then I grew 100 seeds
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with my friend Keith.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, different Keith.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dude's taking a lot of credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different Keith.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's different Keith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabe introduced me to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's Keith.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so you know, can I interject
something real here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been busy at the Apple Store trying
to get my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm missing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wanted to make sure this happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they call me Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I told them is that you should be
called Staten Island because you lived
[SPEAKER_01]: there before me and after me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to put you back on mute.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a different Keith.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to establish that so people know.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's renting the hill up on Toad
Hill area, Grimes Hill, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we go and we set up a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pop 100 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of the 100 seeds, I go this one right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this seed the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the most beautiful seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said this is the number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were numbering everything, one through
100.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know fucking about names yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just started like, all right,
we got this going.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to write something on the tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of 100 seeds, I remember we got 33
females.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Added those 100 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, 33 females, we should say,
and we didn't keep any males, got rid of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was such a diversity, like a lot of
them were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern lights looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Gabby and not so dog was searching
for like things that looked like the chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can understand what they were
saying and reflect on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But out of the 33, 11 of them,
11 of them had chem light traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that first seed that I planted,
the number one became the underdog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the one that was the most chem like,
but it also like it had chem structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it had something about it,
like it was a little bit spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had maybe a little bit more northern
lights in it or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was around around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until I got in trouble now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what year was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That it would have been not around 204.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too many people were doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one friend up on the mountain doing
it who gave it to somebody who took it to
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, it could have got spread out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: People said they had problems with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, the chem is hard to when you try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, super hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got to have the right
temperature root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, the underdog, you know,
people cross it in with the sour,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so I a friend of mine gave me a cut
10 years ago when I moved here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the cut that I'm working off in
the corner I call underdog northern lights
[SPEAKER_00]: or.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you back breed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The northern lights does come out and it's
it's dominant in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's why I like now I have the chem
back and I'm going to cross the chem back
[SPEAKER_00]: into it this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the cut that you got back recently,
which one is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or not really, but the 91 I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had to sell my just just so
you know, Mike, we can get you the
[SPEAKER_01]: original dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The what?
[SPEAKER_01]: The chem dog, not the 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you were saying can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you don't want that candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what's your what's your opinion on
can be in your theories on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so here's my theory on the KMD.
[SPEAKER_00]: KMD has mutations in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Destroy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like why you keep a plant around that
has problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I have a plant that there's
something genetically wrong with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, I eliminate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you destroying the gene pool?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a purist in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I know it's fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's euthanize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces nice blood, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but don't use it for breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not going to use it for
breeding, then you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my but nobody's going to destroy
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can keep it around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm the same way with certain
traits, too, where it's like my OCD is
[SPEAKER_02]: just so zeroed in on something like I
won't pop bag seed if I don't know what's
[SPEAKER_02]: in it and I won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it's the most dank thing ever,
I won't pop it because my brain can't deal
[SPEAKER_02]: with not knowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't know a seed, I'll pop it
because if I have room for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because I make seeds and I can't
even pop them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People give me seeds and I'm like,
what the fuck am I going to do with these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be an asshole,
but I accept it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what, everybody who's
listening to this, it's not that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to like think I'm a snob or
anything, but I already have so many seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm actually I'm actually really
looking for the good mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you guys talked about feminize and
using feminize and knowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to do the pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I like males.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer males personally, even though I
make them spray and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the thing is with males,
it's it's people.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, anybody can make seeds using a male.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But getting a male using it and being able
to predict what he's going to do and
[SPEAKER_02]: working with him enough to be able to do
that, that's that's a skill and a talent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's much different than just using
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seeds that I have now, like a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are very stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, I know what I'm going to get
when I pop this one northern lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: which got some Durbin in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sour, I'm like, I know exactly
what to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at it from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can grow 10, 20 of them and get the same
exact thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like and I have jars of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I'm not growing it this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but you know what you're going to
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: You knew what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, but it's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like it when I come home from work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing I usually hit and then later I
do the dog or the sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever tried a good blueberry sour?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm going to send you some and I would
be open to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely be open to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's an interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like even my own son is giving me a
bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, Dad, this is my Christmas
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, all right, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's killing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have them up on the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to plant them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hold them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sentimental.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sentimental.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just gave him the cut, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I finally gave.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can make it generational,
generational.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is cool, but it's like you have
you have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it can lead to problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't want problems for your kids,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: One second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, in a little in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to edit that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read it down to 46.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where where we are?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about male breeding,
selecting males.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oh, the reason I offered the blueberry
sour, it's just it's one of those things
[SPEAKER_02]: where blueberries, some people love it or
hate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you get the right one with the
super blueberry blueberry jam,
[SPEAKER_02]: like strong sense and taste, it's also
very medicinal.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is something to that nursing quality
that comes with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's real special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found that in the blue sour punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I you know, like I have the same
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: People give me seeds and I'm like,
I'm not going to be able to ever pop
[SPEAKER_02]: these.
Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you are welcome to those and you can
store them forever if you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, everything goes in a freezer now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I've learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think I I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: A while back, I wanted to try this root
hormone thing that you were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I never heard back from you or a
root pop and starting seed starting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like the way to take the shell off
the seed or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, maybe, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I do it manually when I do it like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's also gibberellic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have still some like really like 30
something year old seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yeah, that's like a tissue
culture level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's that's I wouldn't even play
with that tissue culture level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried with so many of the like this sour
northern lights that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Left over it and nothing ever came with of
them at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brutal, brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would do like four at a time and
pray and I'd start try different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took sandpaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the yeah, soaked them overnight,
did a peroxide wash, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I tried distilled water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to keep it sterile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they just don't have that energy
to go anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, some of them put out a little tap and
that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can get it to do that, then that
means gibberellic acid might work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was now years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's see, that's that's a big
help, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's they might still have that
vigor just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like four left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, brutal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brutal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's that's a seed life,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a seed man's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I still have to like a jar of
like a spice jar full of NL times five
[SPEAKER_00]: from original sensei first cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get those to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and they've been, you know,
but the first few years, they weren't in
[SPEAKER_00]: the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you say use northern
lights, which do you remember which
[SPEAKER_02]: northern lights you used as the mail?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it one, two, two by five, five by two?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was number five, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean to cross into the camp?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that we bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was no time at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll find one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, I believe, because the end of times
five, that was tall, giant plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And five was all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a Afghani Hawaiian Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to get like two liters soda bottles
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Airy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, fuck that plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in there, that's the happens to be the
jar of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I've read the chem lights
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it could be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But never did anything with the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a NL five from the Northern Lights
crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you ever want to run through those,
you're more than welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just an open pollination of the
original seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the NL that I used, like it had just
like spicy aroma to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was it was a short plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only grew, just like it said,
100 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three foot wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, all right, dang fucking like
if you had a roll of coins in your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bud was like the weight of a roll of
coins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it sounds like a one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a bud like this big like in it for a
small mason jar would be nine grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, since I haven't been involved,
can I can I add something here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weasel here, but he had nothing,
nothing to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, yeah, like it's going to be
really short, like 15, 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know what I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an hour and a hour and a half
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this guy, okay, he hasn't even begun
to tell you all the stories you can tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be like a multi episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to we're going to have to
record at least three more to get like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, anywhere near what what what
needs to be said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what, like interviewing Klopp
right now, I don't think anybody who's
[SPEAKER_02]: like, I'm not that good of an interviewer,
but your your ability to speak right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're you're so much more eloquent and on
the ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they just didn't ask you
the right questions or what it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had a chance since I had a
chance to tell everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had a chance to tell Mike how
much I love him.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much I miss him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just in New York and I didn't get to
see him.
[SPEAKER_01]: My lady and kid got sick on the day that
we were supposed to see him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't seen him in years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might have got some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might have got some seeds if he showed
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I showed up, I would have been hooked
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead, bro, my family was so sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me, you didn't want me coming over.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, so I just got to see you
again soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but I got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just hung out with Keith and
Ross the other night last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This camera makes you look way better,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's the same camera,
but you can't see you in the car in your
[SPEAKER_02]: face.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're much more handsome up close than
you're far away.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just really can't see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sure about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this cool background that I got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're Steve Jobson.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had more hair than I did, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, how long do they make you wait
in the Apple Store today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been here since 510.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the issues really were mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which phone are you using?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting the 14 Pro Max.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm getting the new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need it for what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I take so many photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the terabyte model and it's
completely filled with video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe I completely filled them
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to delete stuff every day to take
more videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't use iCloud?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, but my iCloud is full also because
they only give you one terabyte.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I filled it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, Daddy Warbucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't let you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't let you expand it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like Dropbox.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dropbox is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife likes that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get all the photos sent to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Google Drive's letting me upload crazy,
crazy amounts of terabytes of video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you tried that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use all the services.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, so since I'm sitting here waiting for
a minute, I want to make sure that in this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast, I said it in other ones,
I wanted to say in this podcast that Klopp
[SPEAKER_01]: here was the first person that I ever saw
grow indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he did that, I stopped being a
gypsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was time for me to get a place and be
more like Klopp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I might have given him a little bit of
inspiration by showing him some indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: flower, but he inspired me to go get an
apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what happened with me?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why he's such a critical part of
the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what happened with me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I went the reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met him, and I winded up going on tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: You became a gypsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ripped up on you the opposite way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I am working a full-time job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, hey, man, let's go on tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome, though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what we've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as genetics questions, we've
touched on the headband.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we covered headband or what
your theory was on that, or opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure because did somebody take a
strain and rename it, or did they pop a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't something that you named from
your perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: AJ says headband because he's made me
sweat up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, okay, fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: AJ is the one that has promoted the salad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the man who has marketed for it
around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, definitely, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met him in Central Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was with a girl and he was like,
I don't know, he was like 17.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had the silver haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, did he?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back then, it would have been silver pearl
by haze, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silver pearl.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good shit, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a fan of silver pearl.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still run it in an old cut and it's
fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Squat little indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much weed do you smoke a day?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the time to smoke as much as
I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't have the time, but I do
anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: It fucks my days up when I do it,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody, but I would say the
majority of the guys that I work with
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sneak out, they smoke weed during
their break time, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York City is built on weeds,
booze, and pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the construction workers smoke
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dependent on the job sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's big in pain, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a lot of guys have medical cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't smoke at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm the shop steward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you kind of can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't take a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't take shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I come home, yep, first thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dinner time, first thing after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four bed, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Three joints at the most?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know why?
[SPEAKER_02]: I started smoking a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I got older, once I hit about 35,
I say older, once I hit 35, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I hit 35, like my inner hormones,
my brain chemistry changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything seemed too strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was getting paranoia every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way I had to beat it was to
constantly smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I never got paranoia again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also was downside was I lost a lot
of my ability to feel different highs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a give and take.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smoke constantly all day long,
do you get high?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it just barely takes the edge off.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So waiting from when I come home to smoke
is that's when I get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then now I got to watch it,
that I don't get too high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to greet two young men in about
a half hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to be, you know,
said that, like, Dad, you okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you got to keep your shit together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of this weed can make you drool,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some dabs can seriously put you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they have an inkling of knowing
