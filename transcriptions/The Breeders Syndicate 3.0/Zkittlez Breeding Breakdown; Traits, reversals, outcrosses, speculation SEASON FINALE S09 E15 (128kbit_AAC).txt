[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_01]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_01]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_01]: seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_01]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The syndicate is a collection of seed
makers that want to push back against all
[SPEAKER_01]: the smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew here with my co-host,
Thousandfold, and today we have local and
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer Dan with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thousand, let's hear about the show and
this is our season finale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we finally get to our Skittles episode
and we have Dan and local both because
[SPEAKER_00]: they have had an interest, perhaps
different angles of interest into the
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles, Green Sherb, Helium Pie
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both have some experience either with the
cut and or with the S1s of either the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherb or the Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan has worked with it commercially,
if I'm not mistaken, Dan, in some degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, pretty extensively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we initially planned to do this
with CSI, but he's been too busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have his blessing and also a little
representation of him right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There he is, right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a bit about how the...
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit about how the episode is
going to be structured.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first half is really just us unpacking
what we all know and have observed and not
[SPEAKER_00]: me so much as these three, whether in the
cut itself or the S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second half of it is going to
be about hypothetical breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't be going to origin stories per
se, as we have for other clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not going to be talking about the
people side, like who did what,
[SPEAKER_00]: when.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's less the priority today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a cluster anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we want to stay away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest, I've always been keen on
and Matt, I know, has always been keen on
[SPEAKER_00]: this side of things where you actually
work to find out what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, we can step in,
I think, to talking about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: traits of the Skittles clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan, do you want to start us off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, obviously, jump in at any time,
Luke will jump in at any time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we may as well start with what I think
is its most notorious attribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's scent, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's scent is something that blows
people's minds if they've never smelled
[SPEAKER_04]: anything like that in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so especially for people that are
touring a facility or something,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like always a treat to be able to be
like, oh, you don't really smell weed very
[SPEAKER_04]: often, like come smell this plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like to me, it's kind of like this
like cherry lemon grapefruit thing,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like somewhere in between all of
it with like this creaminess that's like
[SPEAKER_04]: really pretty mild compared to some other
cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like also it's there and it's
distinct.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like it's it's also like a dwarf
little mutant that grows super,
[SPEAKER_04]: super slow and has just an absolutely
terrible root system that like it and the
[SPEAKER_04]: roots are there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just don't work well for whatever
reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like maybe it has like a naturally low
respiration rate or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's it's a pretty hard to work with
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's hard to clone it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like you can veg them for weeks and
weeks longer than everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty short flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we like to take it at between like 50
and 56 days before that nose disappears
[SPEAKER_04]: because it will.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just turn into cardboard.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's kind of my little my
little summary of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nice plant, though, all green.
[SPEAKER_04]: Realistic picture of Z right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, dead on photorealistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Realistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the most impressive plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, what's your take on the scent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the same as Dan's or do you have a
different opinion?
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, like when we grew it, it was
extremely I can't I don't want to say
[SPEAKER_01]: citrus in the sense that it's like orange
because it's not to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like the essence of grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and the flavor lingers like it gives
you the lip smacking thing where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: constant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stays in your mouth for quite some time
after.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just it hangs in my mouth like
tangy and Calio do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's why I have a big
association with the citrus parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, grapefruit is where I lean most
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And local, have you have you tried the cut
local?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember if I've asked you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't tried the cut specifically,
but I've tried a few ZS ones from Caleb
[SPEAKER_02]: that he grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those were honestly kind of all within
the range of what Dan and Matt both
[SPEAKER_02]: described.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really heavy kind of like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Citrusy like kind of candy thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The smoke is like really transparent to
like the way it tastes and smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost damn near identical.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's it's really tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the same does translate to flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, that's obviously a big deal,
as we've discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the sense in terms of effects
potency?
Low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I definitely built up a
tolerance to Z and the ZS ones and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Sherbess ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extremely fast, extremely fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it wasn't like there was ever like a,
whoa, this is deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I never never hit there,
even the first smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like how does it compare in that
sense to like other cookie derivatives or
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say less less potent than average.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because there's like decent
potency and modern, you know, like gelato
[SPEAKER_04]: baselines and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not always there, but, you know,
with just like a little heterosis from out
[SPEAKER_04]: crossing, you can usually bring stuff into
the high 20s and get, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like a decent effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, Skittles, like I think you're
pretty hard pressed to get high off it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to blend it with potent weed that
may not be the most flavorful,
[SPEAKER_04]: like a nice cam or an OG or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like add that fruity elements.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got like the skunky earthy,
you know what I mean, with the candy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I use it as like a flavor modifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And blends, you know, one of the things
that like, I think when we talk about the
[SPEAKER_01]: clone being kind of like a kind of piece
of crap, I think some people do agree like
[SPEAKER_01]: growing it, it's not the most friendly
plant is the branching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we try to talk about the
branching, it has even to me, it has even
[SPEAKER_01]: more bendy, limp limb structure than say
an OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's not as tall and it's more
short and squat, it's very odd looking,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost like a train wreck style,
just to where it just flops all over
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never had good turgid structure for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also like doesn't really have like
strong apical dominance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you'll never get like a tall lanky
clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always this little ball plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without without topping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, without topping.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three to Syndicate 3.0 is coming at you
with props, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to add this kind of a random
question, but like, in your minds,
[SPEAKER_00]: are there any other kind of cuts or lines
that are comparable in whatever fashion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like does it remind you of anything else
for whatever reason, whether in structure
[SPEAKER_00]: or smell or anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or no, it's quite unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like sweet pink grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a long, not the exact same,
but the the the terps are similar enough
[SPEAKER_01]: and unique enough for what SPG was at the
time to have made the same kind of impact,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I associate them so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the grapefruit part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one thing for the people who are not
in the US, especially like when did it
[SPEAKER_00]: come into the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't in my outline, but I just kind
of came to mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did it really like hit the market and
how much of an impact would you all say it
[SPEAKER_00]: has had relative to something like gelato?
[SPEAKER_01]: 2017, 2018 is when it really impacted the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the Emerald Cup where they were
trying to sell every seed form of it
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was like spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was spring.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was spring 2017 when the Dookie
Bros dropped their trees and humble
[SPEAKER_04]: because that's what I remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was still in college, but I think it was
my senior year or my super senior year,
[SPEAKER_04]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember ditching class and going
because like they had announced on
[SPEAKER_04]: Instagram that they were, you know,
had limited quantities of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I got the last one that was on
the tray and it was like the least well
[SPEAKER_04]: rooted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I didn't know how big of a piece
of shit it was, but we actually didn't end
[SPEAKER_04]: up keeping that cut long term because the
hype hadn't built yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was still spelt like the candy too.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no Z's involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I couldn't get anyone to grow it
because it was this bad rooter.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was veg so slow, just like those growth
traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody really wanted to grow it because
that hype hadn't built up yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as the impact it's had,
I think, I mean, just look at the modern
[SPEAKER_01]: names on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's got a Z in it now,
whether it has actual skittles in it or
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its actual impact has been that everybody
sticks Z's on shit now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I think it and GMO also are like
single handedly responsible for the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: rosin revolution in extracts because Z
actually does have, I forgot to mention
[SPEAKER_04]: that earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does have really nice resin traits for
washing and those trichomes just fall
[SPEAKER_04]: right off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so those were like, I think the first
two that were the earliest, I think that
[SPEAKER_04]: ended up being washers that have lasted to
this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a cultural question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the Z responsible for the term za?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that from something else?
[SPEAKER_04]: I would bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you get za without the Z
revolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: No way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Matt was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I call it Z, what will people think?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that you're British just like you
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of like this crappy growing,
like this kind of, you know, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: mention multiple times and how bad it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else that grows as
poorly or that grows like it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Urkel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's kind of like what I would
compare it to if I was like being like,
[SPEAKER_04]: hey, you've never grown this, but like,
here's the reality of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they had like knew their purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have experience with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not as leafy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Z is not as leafy as puck, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same kind of structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slow growing, shitty roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that came to mind was like,
have there been any notable out-crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: with it historically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, tons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it just depends on what you consider
notable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, I guess 2017,
2018, I don't find anything notable too
[SPEAKER_01]: much, but at the same time, it has had a
major impact on the culture and notably
[SPEAKER_01]: like, yeah, I mean, there's a lot of just,
like I said, the Z's are in everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's honestly, I think it's been
more of like a marketing revolution than
[SPEAKER_04]: actual like number of plants that have
come from it kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Skittles and then like maybe
Moonbow kind of thing and Rainbow Belts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the only like three like big
names and they weren't really that widely
[SPEAKER_04]: distributed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think the first iteration of
Rainbow Belts was like super well
[SPEAKER_04]: received.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the lineage on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, I don't know about Rainbow Belts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it Dosey Dose?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking Skittles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was Moonbow, but I could be
wrong on all of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is Moonbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was Rainbow Belts, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but I've seen stuff that
looks like Rainbow Belts come out of like
[SPEAKER_04]: some classic combos of like Z,
OG, Z headband, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you get those dwarf little guys
with the really chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Z Cube was the one that I had the
first experience with before the Moonbows
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much you pay for those?
[SPEAKER_01]: $500 a pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I remember too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember, I think it was Shiloh.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Fields?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I bought it from Shiloh and Shiloh
charged me $500 a pack for, I think I
[SPEAKER_01]: spent $6K and $500 a pack all the way up.
[SPEAKER_01]: No breaks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time I've met Shiloh at like events
and stuff, he's been a really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super nice businessman for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the one I get out of all those dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those dudes, the only one I get along
with.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, since you mentioned it, Matt,
what was it like working with Z or the Z
[SPEAKER_00]: Cube?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Skittles smell is not consistent in Z
Cube, despite it supposedly being a BX3.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittle BX3.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Skittle BX3.
[SPEAKER_01]: A very fast BX3, I might add.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning like it was made very quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing I noticed was despite
buying many different kinds of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles hybrids, that everything except
the Rosés, the Rosé types were identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like not that everything was uniform,
but everything looked like the same
[SPEAKER_01]: expressions coming out of different packs,
no matter what the parent was,
[SPEAKER_01]: if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a lot to spend to see something
I could have seen in one pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that said, the outcrosses,
they could definitely outcross Z dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the structure better on Z Cube.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crosses, it just, it wasn't consistent
for the Terp, so I had a really hard time
[SPEAKER_01]: calling any of its Skittles unless it was
dominating that particular cross,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it didn't really bring much in that
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it could have been done better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relatively speaking, what were some of the
more successful results, do you think,
[SPEAKER_00]: in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a do-si-do snorkai.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see Magcut cross to the Z Cube early on
called Do-Skittles, which is essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: similar to Moonbow, but it was a few years
earlier, and people really like that one a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's like, I didn't love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite was the Skittles Blue Bonnet,
and I worked that further, but that one
[SPEAKER_01]: was like a merging of the Grapefruit and
Blueberry, which to me, right,
[SPEAKER_01]: it reminded me a lot of like Blue
Satellite, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like Blue Satellite.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you call that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles Bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think he did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never released it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I only ran them and then used
it in the Blue Skittles Blueberry Mac one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send them to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have sent the last of them to Dee,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what happened to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they were all white.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all shitty seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just like, I can't sell this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty it happens a lot, you know,
with like a really healthy expression of
[SPEAKER_04]: it that you get a pretty fair portion of
white seed in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, they were they were like
mottled gray, but just like not full brown
[SPEAKER_01]: tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew there's no way I can sell these
because people would just like flip out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, it definitely has like its own
unique seed morphology, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually used that surprisingly
successfully as like a predictor of like
[SPEAKER_04]: those terps, you know, and in my line,
it's like a limey kind of smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once I fixed that, like they were all
like really consistently limey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I had one run where I like was doing
a breeding project.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was pretty strapped for time and I
didn't take as good a notes as I should
[SPEAKER_04]: have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I was kind of just like smelling
these like flower bins and the shucked
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds off to the side.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I was kind of just like,
well, that one looked really similar to
[SPEAKER_04]: the mother seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm going to I'm going to try that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like when I grew them, they were just
like amazing, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I actually look for that now and
I've kind of noticed it interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like it's not something that people
ever like look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm actually kind of obsessed with it
to a certain degree, because when you know
[SPEAKER_04]: a line, you know what it seeds look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chem D seeds are like little dark brown
circular like spherical balls.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's what I've always kind of seen
from them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Z is kind of like these little dinosaur
eggs with these like few but like pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: specific looking modeling on it,
I think is what it's called.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They look like dinosaur eggs.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I always call it, you know,
because they look different, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: than the average seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, funny little anecdote.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had like a buddy telling me in a trim
room one time we had some seeded weed on
[SPEAKER_04]: this outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, you can't tell the
difference of these seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just like, let me look at them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm looking at these five cups of
seeds and I'm like, mix them all up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I separated them perfectly and told
them exactly what they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you've gone through a lot of
seeds and you've made a lot of lines,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you just sorted seeds a lot,
like it becomes very evident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, this came from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This came from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like trainwreck has its own type of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like there's all kinds of
strains that really have distinctive seed
[SPEAKER_01]: types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was working a bunch of S1s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they were like distinct separate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: A bunch of Caleb stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's the same as if you were like
a, I don't know, a woodworker looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you can see a lot more than
someone else could just because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time you spent with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you mentioned the S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you got me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say, like for that
comment, me and someone else were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about a mutual, I should call them an
acquaintance now, a mutual acquaintance
[SPEAKER_01]: that it seems like what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is very typical in the weed
business was taking someone else's seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and looking at what it was and was
thinking, oh, let me think this has skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: one, haze and something else and all five
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me say this is, you know, a tie
Afghani something, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'd see him move these things around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem was like, if people knew
those lines well enough that he was
[SPEAKER_01]: confabulating for the others, it's still
just as obvious because traits are traits
[SPEAKER_01]: are traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the one thing a lot of people
miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they aren't able to see it themselves,
they don't understand that other people
[SPEAKER_01]: can see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't get it, but it is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, that should be a
strong implication of this whole episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the way we're exploring this is
through traits, through observations,
[SPEAKER_00]: not through, yeah, not through,
you know, as I mentioned, like a
[SPEAKER_00]: historical lens as much, which I think I
think is a really interesting way to go
[SPEAKER_00]: for us as well, even in terms of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad Dan mentioned the S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously we're going to dive into,
yeah, thoughts on Skittles S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone say S1?
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone say S1?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the S1 master.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I ask Loco before we jump into the
S1s, was there anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Loco doesn't mention that he may
not have as much to say about the clone
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, but Loco, was there anything else
you wanted to add before we went into the
[SPEAKER_00]: S1s?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we can just like briefly,
just so like people can like understand my
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of experience with the plant in
general and just like the timeline.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like we mentioned like the Dinky Bros
breaking up with like, I don't even know
[SPEAKER_04]: what their group was called at that point,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't Dying Breed yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't Turpogs yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I don't- Was it third gen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you know what, was that, it might,
yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the Kyle Cushman Shiloh thing,
but I don't remember anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: what it was before then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't as keyed in to like the whole
like IG, like I was just kind of getting
[SPEAKER_04]: into it and figuring out like who everyone
was in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was hidden away for a while,
but yeah, like they do that in 2017
[SPEAKER_04]: spring.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get the clone, couldn't get anyone to
grow it, drop it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I come across it again, or the kind of
family in LA.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when I get the green sherb in the
sunset.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do run, I was telling you about
this, I think like a week ago,
[SPEAKER_04]: but yeah, like we get the sunset,
we get the green sherb and we run them
[SPEAKER_04]: side by side and we're like, well,
fuck this green thing, you know what I
[SPEAKER_04]: mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: The sunset's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's purple, it's gas, it's creamy,
it's like, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like I saw a plant that had like
pretty good modern structure, like pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: full, pretty unremarkable in most ways,
just like lime green, like a little fruit
[SPEAKER_04]: basket kind of bouquet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I forgot about it for another
year or two, you know, until I got a cut
[SPEAKER_04]: called Skittles quote unquote from a buddy
in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that cut was more similar in structure
to the green sherb, but it smelled like
[SPEAKER_04]: the key lime pie.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and so I bred with that for a
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now recently, you know, since I've had
my current job for the past year,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just been like crossing Skittles to
everything and doing tons of in-crossing
[SPEAKER_04]: or out-crossing work, a bunch of different
inbreeding projects and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's been interesting to see it
all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, it's like we're saying
earlier, it's those traits don't always
[SPEAKER_04]: line up the way that you really want them
to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe Loco can say a bit as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's obviously not on the same
scale and not trying to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: make it feel awkward or anything,
but Loco, you've run some sherbest ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I ran two packs for Caleb in the
past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have another six going right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one dampen off, so I'm just down to
six.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, relatively speaking,
they're all really nice plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I've kind of found that was cool is
that I know people shit on the structure
[SPEAKER_02]: of Z a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one thing I did not notice in the
sherbest ones is there was like no lack of
[SPEAKER_02]: vigor, so to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got some pretty nice, like,
you know, decent yielding plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing, you know, out of the ordinary or
like, you know, spectacular or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some color on the leaf,
but not much of it really faded to the
[SPEAKER_02]: bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, my room wasn't the
coldest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was showing some pics to Matt
the other day and he pointed one out that
[SPEAKER_02]: looked kind of like what you would see in
cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I thought was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean by that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the nudge structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it would be like the inner
nodal spacing, like the way you kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: see them spaced out from each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty kind of obvious, like now that
I look at it again.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know, like the smell is just
really nice, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think it's as strong as like
the Z S1 smells, but they are like the
[SPEAKER_02]: exact same theme, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I wanted to, I wanted to add here,
like we haven't been able to verify the
[SPEAKER_01]: key lime pie is the exact same cut as
green sherbet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's never been a time when anyone that
I know personally has gotten them both
[SPEAKER_01]: sourced from really good sources at the
same time to run them side by side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to add that caveat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, yeah, we should actually really
explicitly signpost this, because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think we actually spelled it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the speculation is that green sherb,
key lime pie, skittles, either the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing will have something to do with each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, very close, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, skittles is something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles is, is definitely a different
clone than the key lime pie and green
[SPEAKER_01]: sherb.
[SPEAKER_01]: But key lime pie and green sherb,
it's definitely debatable on whether
[SPEAKER_01]: they're related.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, I describe, I describe key
lime pie different than Dan does,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, because we didn't have in the
same environment, same room, all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How, how Z is related to green sherb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that is definitely speculation,
but there's a lot, so much in common that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hard to ignore, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's speculation basically that they
are, that these three are at least loosely
[SPEAKER_00]: related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's fair to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if we were taking, we were like
placing bets, Dan, what would your bet be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I still don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of like why it's such an
interesting topic is that I still don't
[SPEAKER_04]: think anyone's found a dead ringer in a
green sherb S1, but I think a green sherb
[SPEAKER_04]: bag seed is definitely part of the
equation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because like for those traits,
the way that I've seen the traits break
[SPEAKER_04]: down and how they outcross versus when you
self and stuff is that like the structure
[SPEAKER_04]: and the resin qualities are really
dominant and the aromas are really
[SPEAKER_04]: recessive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you only ever really see them when
you cross it to things that it's kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: related to already, which is sure,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can actually get some of those
Z terps at low rates to pop up by even
[SPEAKER_04]: crossing like Z into gelato stuff,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not very common.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, as far as like the percentage
breakdown.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would, yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You finish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was just going to say like,
I think that green sherb, like a green
[SPEAKER_04]: sherb double up on some of these traits
that being like in an S1, I think is like
[SPEAKER_04]: a necessary step.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also do have a suspicion that it was
outcrossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've kind of pippered the conversation
with this already, but Dan, would you tell
[SPEAKER_00]: us like in terms of these ZS ones,
like what did you observe?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I grew 45 of them and I got 35 jars of
flour out of it because some of them
[SPEAKER_04]: hermed and then some of them were just
like literally so unworkable and dwarfed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And slow growing that like it just wasn't
going to happen, you know, with the pace
[SPEAKER_04]: of our work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what I saw was like a 90% skittles,
like dead ringers of skittles and its
[SPEAKER_04]: structure and its expression, but just
with cardboard terms, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like not good at all, like almost
aromalus, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other 10% was eerily similar
to cookies and, and sunset sherbet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had a very sherb look to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were also completely aromalus,
you know, but there was a handful,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we had four keepers out of those
35 that were all notable for one reason or
[SPEAKER_04]: another, you know, some of them had better
potency.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them had a more true aroma,
but I personally didn't see any of them
[SPEAKER_04]: that I was like this, when I smelled this
and real skittles at the same time,
[SPEAKER_04]: like that's the exact same aroma.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all like how local was saying it's
in the same ballpark, which I call like a
[SPEAKER_04]: mixed starburst.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you had like a cherry,
a lemon and an orange starburst,
[SPEAKER_04]: like all right there on your hand,
that's kind of like the closest thing you
[SPEAKER_04]: see even in the S ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I do personally think that like
skittles, its aroma and profile is a very
[SPEAKER_04]: rare trait combination or gene combination
in that pool because I haven't seen it pop
[SPEAKER_00]: up yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to clarify, in the S ones that you
ran, you were saying like 90% of them were
[SPEAKER_00]: aromalus.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, like 90% were like skittles
expressions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if I showed you the flower and a real
skittles plant, like the clone side by
[SPEAKER_04]: side, you'd be like, yeah, that's the same
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, it's a different like
individual.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Morphologically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was some nice growing things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what is that four out of 35?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like that's like one in seven
has like a pretty nice aroma, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not like non-existent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like not very high prevalence.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like when we're working lines,
I like to fix traits towards like if you
[SPEAKER_04]: pop a pack of 10, you have like a few to
keep.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: That are in that same range, but you're
just going to hone in on what you prefer
[SPEAKER_04]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, did you, did you run out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best ones as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you haven't, you haven't.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I haven't, but I really want to,
I'm just so limited on my like personal
[SPEAKER_04]: space and I don't think it has like a
purpose for my work at my job.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't really care about like the
lineage and you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the mystery kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's more of a personal project.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I don't see MSO is really
giving two shits about lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just, you know, what's already hyped,
what's marketed, what can we hype better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want that profile and some of those
traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And other things, but it just doesn't
really make sense in some regard to like,
[SPEAKER_04]: be like, Oh, let's go buy seven packs of S
ones, run them, find something that's
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've already kind of figured out
other ways with just the clone to kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: get those expressions bumped up a little
higher percentage wise.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, I actually had a little side
tangent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know anything, Matt, about the,
um, the Z sprite cut?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one is honestly even more mysterious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then Skittles itself and like its whole
origins, because like it just like
[SPEAKER_04]: appeared.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one can really tell me anything about
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This bright.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's actually, I think, uh,
another little side tangent off that same
[SPEAKER_04]: profile, but it really does smell like
sprite and I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that was a better,
a better high to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like I've worked with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's like the real cut,
but it has like, you know, the namesake
[SPEAKER_04]: trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so, um, that one is honestly even
more mysterious to me because it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's obviously related.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get some of those Z sprite combos
to pop up pretty easily when you cross
[SPEAKER_01]: them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, well, if anybody in the comments,
uh, or that's watching this, leave in the
[SPEAKER_01]: comments, if you know who this break came
from or anything about it, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real quick, let me, let me chime in on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause Caleb, the one thing that I did or
inspected, the one thing I did get him to
[SPEAKER_01]: comment on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here was on the prevalence of Z
turps in the ZS ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, I think that's the one thing
that he took, um, like a different take
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: He felt like popping a lot of these ZS
ones that he found that turf in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, a lot, lot, but not the exact dead on
turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he said that the scent profile was
there, but in abundance, but not that same
[SPEAKER_01]: exact clone with that scent profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and I've been kind of thinking about
this too, because like, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I got that feedback, you know,
was that a couple of days ago or something
[SPEAKER_04]: like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I've been kind of thinking of it
cause I'm just like, man, maybe I didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: phrase my like question or like wording,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think what it really comes down to
is that like, we have very, very different
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation styles and like the work that
we're doing and he's doing those like
[SPEAKER_04]: living soil, organic beds, you know,
uh, which is like more what I would
[SPEAKER_04]: personally do if I was doing this for
myself, like he is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but it couldn't be more opposite from
what I do at work and our cultivation
[SPEAKER_04]: style, which is like small pot,
cocoa drip line, direct injection,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I bet you he's actually getting a
higher prevalence just because he's
[SPEAKER_04]: growing weed in a way that like that plant
probably prefers more than what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I also noticed this too in a
similar way with the bubble berry V2,
[SPEAKER_01]: like when I first popped, uh, you know,
a handful of them, I saw a lot of very
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry dominant smelling plants in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when the larger population got ahold
of it, like when I sold it and people got
[SPEAKER_01]: packs of it, I was finding out the
blueberry trips were the least common
[SPEAKER_01]: expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really, really bubble gum dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was weird cause I felt like I had a
pretty good representation there and it
[SPEAKER_01]: just like different rooms, different
styles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much that goes into it that
really doesn't get accounted for in
[SPEAKER_01]: variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when customers ask me, Hey,
what am I going to expect from this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to, you know, help my anxiety,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just so many variables involved
and it's really impossible to explain
[SPEAKER_01]: unless you give good examples like these.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's definitely so much difference in
how different people are going to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like, you kind of have to take an
average of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like, if I even only have two data
points, it's like, well, the reality is
[SPEAKER_04]: probably somewhere in between,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, um, you know, maybe the way he's
doing it is literally just like perfect
[SPEAKER_04]: for those expressions on this plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas like, a salt diet and cocoa is
just like not really going to bring it out
[SPEAKER_04]: because like there are other cuts that I
breed with that I get routinely upset that
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, well, we didn't grow it well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, how can you judge this
expression?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I was definitely kind of thinking
about that for the last few days where I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I could be really wrong about
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, based on our wrong style or not wrong,
but like that our cultivation style is so
[SPEAKER_04]: like specific to production and not like,
like best terpene expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I think the way you qualify it,
isn't that you're saying that this is what
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody should expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way it goes down,
it's just like, you're saying this is how
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't, I don't think it's necessarily
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it's completely different run
and take, but it's not conditional.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it makes me want to like slow down and
change some things if I could ever like do
[SPEAKER_04]: that at work.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm like, I've been like,
I've talked to you guys about my
[SPEAKER_04]: frustration with OG too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it doesn't like that cultivation
environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like very probable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, and so like, how can you really
judge a breeding project?
[SPEAKER_04]: If like the expression you're getting is
the worst possible one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if that's why everybody thinks OG
is just gone, despite every fucking OG
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrid out there still.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think, I really think it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a lot of stuff that people
like renamed for clout.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, um, I was telling you before,
like the ghost OG that's going around
[SPEAKER_04]: right now, like people have, I've heard
many people say that it's not the same
[SPEAKER_04]: ghost that used to go around, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm pretty positive that it's like a
Chem D OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Based on the structure and the expression
and the potency.
[SPEAKER_04]: Passing motor breath around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like a way better cut than motor
breath.
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually is a really nice cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys can get your hands on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's it called?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just called ghost now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just called, yeah, ghost OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it's been going around as.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but it's actually really nice,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really pleased with it when we ran
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to come back to Dan's questions
for Caleb, even though I know that Caleb
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't really get an opportunity to answer
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan, I wonder if Dan wanted to at least
tell us about why he wanted to ask these
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these questions, um, in the
outline, I don't know if you guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the outline, but the second
page is some of Dan's questions.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Dan, I don't know if you just wanted
to tell us about why you thought of these
[SPEAKER_00]: or like what, what you, what, what kind of
outcomes you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, that, that first one,
I feel like we already covered and that
[SPEAKER_04]: may be the second one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then we kind of go your overall
strategy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I mean, the main reason that I was
like, I've been so curious about this is
[SPEAKER_04]: that like the cut does have nice traits,
but when you outcross it to just like any
[SPEAKER_04]: and everything, like I kind of been doing
the last year, um, you don't see the
[SPEAKER_04]: things that you want as much as the things
that you really don't like the dwarfism,
[SPEAKER_04]: some like slight hermaphrodism.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's definitely not a herm bomb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, um, I've heard some people describe
it as, but there is some hermaphrodism in
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but like the main thing is,
is that like, I would cross it to all
[SPEAKER_04]: kinds of stuff and I never got even a
semblance of the nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like that's partially, I think due
to cultivation style from like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, our previous little anecdote,
but, um, at the same time, it's also just
[SPEAKER_04]: that like, I've heard plenty of people say
that, you know, that it's just like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't end up with that aroma and
outcrosses, which leads me to believe that
[SPEAKER_04]: it's some like very recessive combination
of traits that actually make it smell and
[SPEAKER_04]: express that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or some link traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the link traits, like the aroma is
definitely tied to the dwarfism as far as
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen, you know, um, but, um,
I try and stay out of like the linked
[SPEAKER_04]: trait whole thing, just cause it's like so
complicated theoretical, almost impossible
[SPEAKER_04]: to prove it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, even talking about the aroma
as like recessive, it's like, well,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's probably like dozens and dozens,
if not hundreds of genes, like that all
[SPEAKER_04]: need to be correctly aligned in the proper
way to like express that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, what I've actually, Oh,
go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me a bit of like, uh,
Matt talking about crossing to super scone
[SPEAKER_00]: types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and that's kind of like what I'm
getting to is that like, so maybe Skittles
[SPEAKER_04]: like let for simplicity sake, let's call
that aroma profile, like a double
[SPEAKER_04]: recessive.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was a single trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like the only way to like really ever
get that expression then would be to find
[SPEAKER_04]: something else that also has a double
recessive, you know, and that's kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: honestly like the success that I've had in
like upping the, um, the rate of
[SPEAKER_04]: expression for that really nice aroma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the ballpark of it has been from
using two children at sea that both have
[SPEAKER_04]: those traits, um, and our children quote
unquote, like one of them being like the Z
[SPEAKER_04]: sprite and one of them being rainbow
belts, you know, cause rainbow belts does
[SPEAKER_04]: smell similar to Z, but it's definitely
not as like pungent or as nice,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, um, yeah, it's just good,
you know, but, um, I actually had a pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: decent rate of, uh, you know, Z terps pop
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, that just means that you have
to like only in cross it really like weird
[SPEAKER_04]: types of in crosses cousin to cousin kind
of thing to be able to ever, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: maintain that profile in a line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's challenging to work with in
that regard because like, you can only
[SPEAKER_04]: really cross it with itself to get those
expressions out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think that like, I think other
people have talked about like using S ones
[SPEAKER_04]: and like maybe the S one will pass it
better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, nah, I really don't think it
will cause you're going to break it up
[SPEAKER_04]: again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me pause you here because I think
that's going to, I think we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: move straight into, um, possible
directions, projects, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to wrap up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of like your, your, and even
local observations on the sure best ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, um, but actually wait, no,
what am I saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your, your experience with skills as ones,
what do you speculate it's lineage to be
[SPEAKER_00]: based on what you've seen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that like, again, don't hold down
to any of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just like, what is it,
Dan?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the only, the only clue you get,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause if you see 90% Skittles types is the
Shurb expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it just leads you to Shurb,
which is still kind of like not really an
[SPEAKER_04]: answer either.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the green, the green Shurb.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to know, but that's what's funny
is that it looked, the ones look like
[SPEAKER_04]: sunset.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get it really much of anything
that reminded me of the green Shurb cut or
[SPEAKER_04]: the key lime pie and structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, it's all just Skittles,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but that's kind of the whole confusing
part to me, you know, it's definitely not
[SPEAKER_04]: a child's child of sunset, but like it
shares a common ancestor, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: or like a shared lineage with the green,
you know, like that's why it's so,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we can talk in circles for hours
about this kind of thing, because like,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's only enough info to ask questions,
but not enough info to ever have an
[SPEAKER_04]: answer, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan, you're so keyed up on this,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hear those like sharp intakes of
breath, like, yeah, where you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't even end your sentences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have anything to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even just based on your like distant
experience with this, just on like
[SPEAKER_02]: speculation, like got, you know,
I mean, there's some kind of relation,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, like obviously, but doing like Shurb
and Skittle of some sort.
Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Based on what I saw, I mean, some cookie
look alike.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, maybe that would be some kind of
thought on what it could be.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not it's like 100%, but you know,
maybe that's something in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah, I really don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think there's another like
conflating part that makes it equally
[SPEAKER_04]: confusing is that like the only difference
between Shurb and cookies is the supposed
[SPEAKER_04]: out cross, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: A pink panties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what the fuck is pink panties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, you know, that was yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had experience with it and running it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a shit plant, but,
um, and a shit breeder at that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's better than it's a better
breeder than it is a grower, but actually
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at F1 Derb, I would be quicker to
think pink panties is related to F1 Derb
[SPEAKER_01]: based on a lot of the same, um,
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a lot of the same STEM traits and
stuff and, and the way it sets the plan
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, but like I've looked it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be like what Burmese or
Burmese Kush maybe cross to fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot what the other part of it was,
but none of it made any sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I think they say like Burmese to
OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, and there's no possible way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, it's not a good cut,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have the same scent profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does not have the same term profile
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of fruity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not, not all it did was kind of beef up
the Shurb, whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, I wouldn't go with pink
panties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really, really wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it's Shurb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shurb says that's what's in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, he seems like a nice guy,
but I, after growing that cut,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just am very hard pressed to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, oh, by the way, rainbow belts,
it looks like it's a, as Gittles crossed
[SPEAKER_01]: to Moonbow number 75.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a Gittles DX1, I think that
Fletch did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which actually may get you farther away
from what you want then.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the other thing is like, we aren't
going to go too much into history,
[SPEAKER_01]: but when I think about the people working
with that cut and the history,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically, that it came from some dude's
girlfriend's dad in a tray, blah,
[SPEAKER_01]: blah, blah, was labeled cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think about what the third gen
dudes were growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were growing a lot of sweet tooth and
something called adenine and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: Russian Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a few other things that were
staples in their crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I think about sweet pink
grapefruit, and I think about like sweet
[SPEAKER_01]: tooth and stuff like that, I'm like,
Hmm, I wonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it came to them supposedly by the
story ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe that's just like a red herring,
but yeah, I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very confabulated tale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gotten much worse since third gen
dying breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, the other dudes, um, broke up and
stopped being frenzies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gotten even worse on the,
on what they say things are and who did
[SPEAKER_01]: what, where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less consistent, I should say.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't subscribe to the great eighth
grapefruit cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I say grapefruit, but like,
it's not like, obviously that's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's there though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I remember tasting some early extracts,
like some BHO skills and it was like pure
[SPEAKER_01]: grapefruit is very great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where like a lot of my Z stuff
is extracts that I, that I smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, this is fucking great
fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is sweet pink grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I know what this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, but I don't know that that's why,
you know, I don't know if the cuts in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I basically, I really doubt it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause sweet pink grapefruit was a robust,
big, huge, healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, yeah, whatever, like the process
was to make skittles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it involved a lot of inbreeding
and S ones and not on purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like most shit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just a lot of accidents and re re
labels and renames of clones and trays and
[SPEAKER_01]: shit like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone got super lucky on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like one in a thousand, one in 10,000 bag
seed, you know, like otherwise I think we
[SPEAKER_04]: would see sisters to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if it wasn't so obscure and rare,
and recessive, I think that you would see
[SPEAKER_04]: sisters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause if you get a bag of bag seeds or
like the way I keep bag seeds,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, like ideally like 20,
30 of them, if it was really seeded,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have to agree on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But trying to find out even guess what
could be in skittles other than like this
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie type sherb types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the other factor would be really,
really shooting in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I want to eventually go back to
the green sherb S1.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like actually run through those.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, I don't have the like
capability of doing it at the scale that I
[SPEAKER_04]: would want to like, I want to do like 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm glad we're here because this
is where I think we pivot towards looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we do that, I guess it's like,
so the question is like, what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: future of Z?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to ask like, who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we care?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does Matt care?
[SPEAKER_00]: How far can it be taken?
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, Matt, so Matt doesn't seem super
enthusiastic about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the future of the clone in general,
even talking to Dan, like the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're having to do all these go to all
these measures to keep it alive,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to reproduce like I can see it
being kept alive in other lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as that clone goes,
I think that there is going to be a day
[SPEAKER_01]: where that clone is gone because of how
sickly it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily with HLV, but I mean,
just like its natural structure is very
[SPEAKER_01]: not not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been in a lot of shitty rooms before
it made it up to a bunch of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just not hardy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see it living as far as why it's
not widely held either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people couldn't keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't root it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I don't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't keep rooting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, like I think because it's an
inbred type plant, but it's recessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what kind of future it would
even have in breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people are going to keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it should be done or not,
or whether it's making better shit because
[SPEAKER_01]: the market's determined by names and it
doesn't really matter how good it is as
[SPEAKER_01]: long as it's hyped.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this kind of market, maybe it'll
last forever in hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually heard from Dan, despite his
excitement, that he just kind of cares
[SPEAKER_00]: about solving the mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not mistaken, Dan, you don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even like it that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's flavorful, but I think it's a
really shitty breeding tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you want resin traits that come
with a ton of baggage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like even sour, essentially,
like I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't love sour better than anything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the mystery of it has held me for so
goddamn long that I'm not going to drop it
[SPEAKER_01]: until I figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like the whole like murder
mystery kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm not really into that stuff,
but I can get hooked on it if I get that
[SPEAKER_04]: introduction of the story.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: At the party, we need to have a murder
mystery game.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like what happens?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to know what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I've just been around it a lot and
had experiences, but I don't personally
[SPEAKER_04]: like it that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hate working with it because it
never does what you want it to.
[SPEAKER_04]: But going back to that whole theoretical
recessive thing, you can actually have a
[SPEAKER_04]: recessive trait like that that's dominant
or dominant, prevalent in a population,
[SPEAKER_04]: but everyone has to have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like over generations,
if like there's even like a handful of
[SPEAKER_04]: individuals that don't, those are going to
be dominant over the recessives and
[SPEAKER_04]: eventually take over at like a population
scale over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and so like, I think it's kind
of a doomed tool because of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there, I think it'll be around and
like people will hold cuts of different
[SPEAKER_04]: crosses or like S1s or whatever,
because like it is really tasty and it
[SPEAKER_04]: makes delicious extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like as a breeding tool, I think it's
like next to useless, honestly,
[SPEAKER_04]: unless you love breeding for resin traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to pivot to local here because I
know local is looking at some strip S1s as
[SPEAKER_00]: he mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe I'd like to hear from him,
like what he thinks might be possible or
[SPEAKER_00]: what, maybe first of all, what is he
looking for in the S1s?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if he does find that thing,
you know, what, what does he think he
[SPEAKER_00]: could do with it later?
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, bro, I'm kind of just looking
for some saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I need some cultural context.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That people would eat up, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause even though it's low potency,
people fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like low potency isn't always bad,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But what else local like, is there
something that you want to do with it as
[SPEAKER_00]: well?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I like, it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the flavor and everything,
but I don't know if it would make anything
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly worthwhile in my collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not something that I would go
back to and like dig through extensively
[SPEAKER_02]: again, or.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but you've talked to me about like
having some ideas for potential
[SPEAKER_00]: out-crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know if I'd ever get to
them, but I mean, there's some really nice
[SPEAKER_02]: mango, gummy bear tasting, E.B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appy plants that could be like maybe a
cool out-cross to Sherbert like thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Increase the legs a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep like those candy notes and like
intact possibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I really wouldn't know how it
would pan out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure Matt might've mentioned
something like this in that, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the weird cookies episodes that we
did about like how you would try to
[SPEAKER_00]: counterpoint cookies with something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we did mention Appy as like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess just from the point of view of
like, oh, sorry, you go, Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I remember trying to think about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like trying to add speed,
a better high and all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first idea was like C90.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was like, wait a minute,
I have something way better than C99 that
[SPEAKER_01]: accomplishes all that and is way more dank
and way more pungent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's Appy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I guess for me, this, this section
is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like more or less all of you have said
that you don't care that much about his
[SPEAKER_00]: future, which is funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to force you to pretend that
you do so that we can kind of like tease
[SPEAKER_00]: out some possible hypothetical directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can pass it to Dan now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the Appy idea, but the problem is,
is I think it would take a minimum of two
[SPEAKER_04]: steps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like guaranteed a minimum of two steps
where it's like, you'll have to make the
[SPEAKER_04]: cross and the harder part will be like,
well, how do I find the plants that to
[SPEAKER_04]: double up on to get the expression and the
aroma that I want out of it, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: where you're kind of just picking at
random.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't really have that type of genetic
phenotyping yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, it'll take a lot of trial and
error, I think, but I think it could
[SPEAKER_04]: potentially be really awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I went with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that angle.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think blueberry Z would be fucking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I had a, what was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: The blue Skittles clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I, I never really knew what that
was because like the dying breed one was
[SPEAKER_04]: blue Domina Skittles or whatever,
but like the one that I saw was kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: like a squirt grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like super nice, easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've never actually, I wish I still
had that clone because it was,
[SPEAKER_04]: if it was what it says it was like lineage
wise, it was actually like a really nice
[SPEAKER_04]: expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it supposed to be lineage wise?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's what I don't know is like,
I just got it as blue Skittles,
[SPEAKER_04]: but like it could either be the one that
you made or the one that dying breed made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it's the one they made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I meant mine came way later than
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't, I didn't come across that
honestly though, until about like 2019,
[SPEAKER_04]: 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds about when it showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure that's when it got real
popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember at 2018 Emerald cup,
a lot of people were smoking on blue
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I've been thinking this is not
very, this is not blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck are they doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a space invader kept clones of
the, the main blue blue Z pop that we did
[SPEAKER_01]: from our stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he kept that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some good breeding clones in
there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we're still not pure Z, but in the
outcross with the Mac one, there is one
[SPEAKER_01]: that looks like blue bonnet with Mac,
the Z terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that does exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just crap shoot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of where I'm at with like my
work with it too, is like trying to push
[SPEAKER_04]: those boundaries of like, well,
what's closely related enough to like get
[SPEAKER_04]: the right expression, but like not just
going to be boring and Z only,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and trying to get away from
those morphological traits, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've had some mild success,
but you know, there, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's, I still have never come across a
dead ringer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always just ballpark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Z cube stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, it was very unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was wildly not predictably Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you could find them in there,
but you'd be finding a lot more other
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I know when, when dying breed and
whatever they called them, some platinum
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles, I think they called them at the
time broke up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they, one of them had a Z three,
which was the platinum Skittles guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, phony Mendo and those dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it was a, uh, uh, like Z cube.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure that those were any
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that they were after they broke
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, yeah, ours is Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ours is with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a lot of Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I, what I recognize Hindu Kush stuff
inside of the, um, Z cube.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know which is which.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had some later iterations of both.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, um, BX twos of Skittles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I won't name who they're from cause
I'm about to talk some mad shit,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they were fucking terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like some of the word, like, like imagine
if you had the shitty, all the shittiest
[SPEAKER_04]: traits fixed perfectly in a population.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were all dwarf.
[SPEAKER_04]: They, they were resinless somehow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they lost the good resin trait and they
were all cardboard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I ran a lot of them and I was
like, what the fuck is this trash?
[SPEAKER_04]: How is this group so popular?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it doesn't surprise me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all you have to do is go type in who
made Skittles BX two.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may well have a shorter episode today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're kind of like come to the end of
like, at least the structured questions
[SPEAKER_00]: that I had for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we can talk about whatever really
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if we wanted to start wrapping up,
um, any, you know, any kind of final
thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: No questions or thoughts from everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I knew that we wouldn't get to,
you know, I knew that two hours is quite
[SPEAKER_00]: long for Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only so much to say, you know,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, um, the plant is cool,
but it also sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I mean, I'll be honest with you in
many ways, the plant was really just a
[SPEAKER_00]: foil for us to talk about looking at
traits and what you can learn from looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's really, I think what I cared
about more than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, honestly, that's kind of where I'm at
too, is like, I've been really getting
[SPEAKER_04]: into like visualization of data and like
looking at the inheritance rates of these
[SPEAKER_04]: things and like trying to quantify it and
make like visual aids to like assist my
[SPEAKER_04]: own work with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's been really fun because it's
been a challenge, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And which is forcing me outside of the box
of where I would normally hang out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was never really a data guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was always like breeding and selecting
plants on instinct and my little
[SPEAKER_04]: handwritten note, like, it's given me an
opportunity to like really expand the
[SPEAKER_04]: toolbox to more like analytics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, me and local have been talking a
lot about traits lately privately,
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly revolving around super skunk,
the different looks of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I talk a lot about like
privately, not even privately,
[SPEAKER_01]: like on the server about the dog tongue
traits inside of super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've given examples of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's probably examples of it in
another episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that like a single bladed leaf?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the little it's like a little leaf
that looks like a little dog's tongue,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's absolutely it's rounded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a very specific point to it,
because there's a lot of stuff that has
[SPEAKER_01]: those little pointing leaves, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, that's what I look for in like as
a sour trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's in it's in diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in it's in P 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in clockwork orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in it's it what I've come to realize
over all this just by observing not just
[SPEAKER_01]: that trait, there's other traits inside of
super skunk that I don't really talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: much that I've talked about the local that
I kind of keep back because I don't like
[SPEAKER_01]: other people using those traits against
the plant, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you'll see it on a strainly listing
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, look, it has this trait and it won't
and then I'll be pissed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the one thing I've learned is I
think just because of looking at traits
[SPEAKER_01]: and nothing but traits, I do think that
and this goes along with what Neville
[SPEAKER_01]: said, one of his highest selling seeds
ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like super skunk proliferated
in the early 90s throughout the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States and a lot of different groups
picked it up, ran with it, found their
[SPEAKER_01]: specific cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it became like a local legend in a lot
of different places under different names.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the history on it's gone,
like the history on P 91 is just so
[SPEAKER_01]: obscure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one thing you can follow is traits
and traits just don't lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there can be times where like
maybe a trait isn't just standard to one
[SPEAKER_01]: line, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can pop up and be like,
oh, shit, well, that means nothing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just another data point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I was wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this one, I haven't really seen
that specific trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just the dog tongue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how it's the pattern of that's laid
out on the bud specifically that denotes
[SPEAKER_01]: the super skunk trait for that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like following traits to me,
I'm slowly learning over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Traits can be a lot more honest than
trying to untie people's stories and go
[SPEAKER_01]: back, talk to these people, get
inconsistencies, talk to them three years
[SPEAKER_01]: later, get more inconsistencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just leads to you spinning your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, really understanding traits
and breeding traits can take you so much
[SPEAKER_01]: further when you're trying to figure out
what stuff is, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that dog tongue trait appear in the
like the original Sensei Super Skunk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the original picture of Sensei Super
Skunk, you can see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Dan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say, I had this
thought earlier is that when you're a
[SPEAKER_04]: newer grower, it's pretty easy to look at
the landscape of what's available for
[SPEAKER_04]: purchase or collecting and think that
there's this infinite diversity within the
[SPEAKER_04]: gene pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what my experience over the last 10,
11 years has told me is that honestly,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a lot of stories, but there's not
that many traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I recently saw an argument on IG
about lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the most desirable plant by any
stretch, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did S1 it, and I've run through a
bunch of hybrids of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one thing that popped up at a really
low rate was lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: The exact, not dead-on, but the mouth
coat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Closer than everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the basement version, the stanky
version.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a musty, musty version of fucking
lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so to me, I don't give a shit about
what any of those dudes on IG were talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about it being a renamed Acai gelato 47 or
being a renamed runs, all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just like, bro, it's got lemon
tree traits in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a really high prevalence,
but it's in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it didn't come from out of the blue.
[SPEAKER_04]: These combinations of traits that give you
that expression, they're less common than
[SPEAKER_04]: you would imagine being a newer grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you smell lemon tree, the chances that
there's lemon tree in it, regardless of
[SPEAKER_04]: what anyone says, it's probably in there,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, I smell lemon tree and I smell
lemon G.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a hard, rubber lemon peel that's
just offensively lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that reminds me of that one so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's a whole other clown that's
actually taken my interest in the last
[SPEAKER_04]: year or two is that I've had lemon tree
under like four different names.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was all the same exact plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lemonade and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemonade, lemon tree, organ lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there people associated with that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there are people associated with
lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is a complete lunatic,
like anti-semite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and he's the one that likes to talk
about it the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really hard to get the actual back
history and know if it's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end, none of them know what it
is at all or have any clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I've gotten into lemonade and
lemon tree myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've got lemonade, lemon tree,
organ lemons.
[SPEAKER_04]: And God, it was like a play on lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like maybe it was just lemon trees or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember at the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all been the exact same plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But honestly, I try and stay away from
that stuff because it is like really
[SPEAKER_04]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of get the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dominant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not something that I've
tried down here, but I'm a bit scared to
[SPEAKER_00]: based on what you guys say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some people love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people really like you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I describe it as picture a lemon coming to
life, growing legs in a ballsy dick and
[SPEAKER_01]: pissing in your mouth like lemon,
lemon floor cleaner, but not like low G,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like just pure like actual cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what it's very much like that
lemon man pissing in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get it to be a little sweeter to
where it's just like a really potent lemon
[SPEAKER_04]: candy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that cleaner side of it's always kind
of there where it's like offensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, oh, but it does like coat
your mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon G is the hard offensive part of that
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just the same mouth coating same
every thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's one of those where like,
I know it was super popular in Ohio and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, how could people smoke this shit
over and over for years?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is all lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: When all the weed just tasted like burnt
shit before that, they're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we say cleaner in this context,
like, is there any relation to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, gee, soapy clean or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally different.
No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, like, like pine soul pungency,
but like not piney.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like lemony.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, I don't know, lemon cleaners are
pretty common, like Gugon and like any of
[SPEAKER_04]: those like limonene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or citrus cleaners.
[SPEAKER_04]: Less pine soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pine soul is like a furniture polish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And N.O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: is very furniture polishy, whereas this is
like lemon cleaner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like just gross.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's got the same pungency of
turpinoline, but in its own lane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a perfect way of putting it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not just limonene that makes that
because those cuts aren't even that
[SPEAKER_04]: particularly high in limonene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I think today I actually just saw
like my first test where I like I saw over
[SPEAKER_04]: one and a half percent limonene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's a fucking lot of limonene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like most of it on anything specific.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was doing a ton of data entry today.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like I just noticed shit that like
is abnormal.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like when a cannabinoid profile,
like you'll get like a total total THC or
[SPEAKER_04]: like you'll get some cannabinoid total
cannabinoid and then total THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're all calculated slightly
differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when there's like large
discrepancies between some cannabinoid and
[SPEAKER_04]: total THC, like more than 10 percent of
the potency, I'll go and kind of like dig
[SPEAKER_04]: in the cannabinoids and be like,
well, where's all that extra percentage
[SPEAKER_04]: coming from?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's got to be something like CBG,
CBC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is CBG one percent CBG common to find in
stuff or not?
[SPEAKER_04]: One percent is very common.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, up to like one and a half or two
percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like CBG is the precursor for a
whole strip of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD and THC included.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when the plant is not quite
finished, you'll see an abnormally high
[SPEAKER_04]: CBG content.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me to notice that like 10 percent
threshold, like average difference between
[SPEAKER_04]: those two metrics is like five to seven
percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I see like 10 percent or
above, I'm like, oh, what the fuck is in
[SPEAKER_04]: there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it's usually CBC and CBG.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like that's like kind of one of
my next avenues is trying to get like I
[SPEAKER_04]: have one plant that's like pretty high in
CBG, but it's also very high in THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I can't I haven't quite figured
that one out yet because it doesn't like
[SPEAKER_04]: really make sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that CBG would probably all convert
to THC if I ran it long enough,
[SPEAKER_04]: like 11 or 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like when you harvest it at nine
weeks, like it's done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, you know, loaded with all
these accessory cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm wondering if I can like if I
find another one, I'm like, oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in the money.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can cross these two together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's due to the same kind of like
genetic play at work.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's all like guess and check work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like you just got to find two plants
with the same trait and hope that it's for
[SPEAKER_04]: the same reason and cross it together and
see what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's kind of where I'm at with my
with my rosin work, you know, because at
[SPEAKER_04]: least it's an easy to test for trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to do like analytics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just go wash it real quick and do a
test wash, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea where we're headed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know either, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to just talk about weeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we could probably tie it up.
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that Dan's household?
[SPEAKER_04]: At least my little boy letting his real
shrieks out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be a sign for us to to wrap it
up here, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first time in a while,
we have a one hour episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, it ends up just being two hours
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, two and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have me on telling my bullshit,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we take the we'll take that as an
opportunity to have a more chill day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any last thoughts from any of you
local Dan?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, local.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you didn't probably didn't have
enough like much space in this convo,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything for anyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any shout outs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to our boy here, Mr. Mr.
Inspect, Mr. Inspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out for showing up to the episode
and helping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Caleb.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got pretty pink legs, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I needed him here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might do if he actually ends up being
available, we can do a follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: His what he's found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a hard one, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I got nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just like shout out to the homies
on the server.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I haven't been around much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just been busy and fucking exhausted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're fine, dude, especially after
you had you needed a break after that one
[SPEAKER_00]: week where you recorded like three shows
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been joining the like the sicky club
that we have on our server to where I've
[SPEAKER_04]: just been like not feeling good this week.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think I can do it, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pass it on to all of you through the
mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wipe down those discord voice chats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to coma.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do we got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Local, you got to shut up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Local.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not this time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our call of duty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to fucking bonbons in your mouth
while you're seeing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm eating a payday right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's a payday.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just ordered an instant cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local has to local.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to send me some junk food from
over there, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good idea, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they allow that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that's kind of like commercially
produced and like packaged is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like no live bio material and nothing
that's like open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to start thinking up all the
greasiest, tastiest crap we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: How am I going to get that to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, you want to you want to wrap it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wrap it up like a sheepskin condom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had that picture in my head and had
to finish it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check out our discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's where we hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And shoot the shit and act like idiots and
have fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about strange stuff all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Theoretical, non-theoretical, help each
other grow, help each other grow in life
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes in many cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check out rightseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have lifted seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Liftedgenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember which one he goes by,
but he's on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's carrying a bunch of our dude stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have who else do we have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right Seed Code Europe and Mattie Booze at
Gert Weisseeds in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check all that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, I mean, if you guys have any
comments, leave them below.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always like it when the comments get
blown up with a lot of people's opinions
[SPEAKER_01]: and counter opinions to anything we say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it a lot more fun and
interactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have new codecs entries, Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, there's new codecs entries.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We added F1 Derb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be adding ABC soon or did I
add it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still to be added.
[SPEAKER_00]: You added it though as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to have some more info on
ABC soon too, which is I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's only a few of us that have chased
it 15 years plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're finally getting to the bottom of
some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm stoked about that.
