[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, Clay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every so-called liquid silica product is
made from potassium silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where your pH issues come into
play, problems with raising the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can get it from other sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of the posters here mentioned
rice hulls, and that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's even a powdered rice hull product
that build-a-soil carries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember the name, but I've used
it and it did well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One person asked a very legitimate
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it even necessary?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in my worm bins, I run a lot of rice
hulls as an aeration material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that deconstructs, it's releasing
the silica oxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that's the form it's in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would I add it to my soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, so that question isn't...
You need some silica in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you use it judiciously,
and get like the AgSil product,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what all the other ones,
like the silly one from the guy Advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients, Wet Betty, or some silly name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even a sillier label.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's made from AgSil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all those products that you see in
the grow store, or what I call the house
[SPEAKER_00]: of perdition, they're all made with AgSil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get AgSil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then cut to chase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in a powder form, so you can mix
on an as-need basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's good for emulsifying horticulture
oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get into that mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neem or Carondiwell or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, and I still use them and they're
full of crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people, you know, you gotta learn the
difference between an extract and a
[SPEAKER_00]: pressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that's like trying to
explain why is it called unsulphured and
[SPEAKER_00]: not desulphured molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't wrap your brain around
that one, then I don't want to talk to you
[SPEAKER_00]: about the differences between an
extraction and using solvents and a
[SPEAKER_00]: pressing that goes back at least 3,000
years to, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get off my soap.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about, like PowerSI,
the orthosilicic acids and monosilicic
[SPEAKER_02]: acids?
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff that's not from potassium silicate?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, to be honest with you,
I'm a real minimalist.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you looked at my recipe, the biggest
criticism is, well, there's no there
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's all in the worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't, look, I think everybody
should recycle their kitchen waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't do that, you should have to
be forced to listen to some TV show that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really horrible or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not going to give you a worm
castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as magical as worms are, they can't
turn water into castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that comes from either aged manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that, we mean five to six weeks to
allow the vermicides that are given
[SPEAKER_00]: livestock for, you know, like we do dogs,
you worm them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, those vermicides kill the good guys
in our worm bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to let that sit for about five
to six weeks and they'll degrade into a
[SPEAKER_00]: form, into its basic ionic structure,
if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's no longer a vermicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's carbon and hydrogen and oxygen and
all those good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives us bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you make good castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's through bulking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, the stuff that had,
there's some, I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good bedding that's been elevated with
nutrient dense materials, like small
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of alfalfa meal, kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to run neem and caranja.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might, you might find interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caranja is actually a legume.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's closer to a alfalfa plant than it is
the neem tree, which is a mahogany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the properties in those two materials
couldn't be more different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no shared constituents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Azadirachtin comes from neem and pangamia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pangamia oil comes from caranja.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not familiar with caranja.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what, what is that used for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in India, it's the preferred one for
medicines for skin products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And India has some of its own race issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beliefs that lighter colored citizens
are more intelligent than darkness said to
[SPEAKER_00]: be used to lighten the skin tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it can, but if you,
if you went into an Indian market,
[SPEAKER_00]: and went to the Habas section,
everything would have either neem or
[SPEAKER_00]: caranja in it, you know, shampoo,
toothpaste.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over here, if you get touched with
neem, you're going to fall over dead or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, or, you know, you can't go to
the Rose Parade or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, if you looked at the
Ayurvedic medical system, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have the TCM, traditional Chinese,
India has the Ayurvedic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 72% of the bottled compounds,
you know, elixirs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: 72% have some part of the neem tree,
root, bark, leaf, oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's behind the Tulsi basil,
which is a forerunner of all basils,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the wolf is to our canine friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this one, okay, it's the most holy
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in India is the Tulsi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then neem is the second one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look up for some time, neemresearch.ca.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing to do with gardening,
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about human health, diabetes,
viruses, all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can rub the oil on your feet as a cure
or a prevention of asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Athlete's sweat if you do a lot of running
or, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's been around for 5,000 years,
but suddenly 18 months ago became a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a point of discussion at Kanekon
and Indo Expo, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just silly, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: All this is appreciated.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people asking all kinds of
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mean to dominate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no worries.
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is my worm casting running hot in
sodium?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you think I can push out sodium with
calcium, gypsum?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because gypsum is simply calcium
sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's calcium in its elemental form,
whereas the calcium we get in,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, limestone or oyster shell,
that's calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's one calcium ion, there's one
carbon ion, and then three oxygen ions in
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this, in gypsum, you're getting
calcium by itself, and then you get sulfur
[SPEAKER_00]: oxide, which is water soluble.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like let's say you're using KOR.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that has to be, you know,
acknowledged is that it's an inert medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's preferred if you're going
to use salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in an organic soil, it's a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want to do, the big one that's
missing is sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without sulfur, sulfur is at the base
of almost every metabolical function on
[SPEAKER_00]: this planet, including the production of
terpenes, terpenoids, and ketones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red, I'm using KOR and I can't get any
flavor and I don't get any aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, to put a half a cup of gypsum,
you know, and say a cubic foot,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there you go, you're dancing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something I had to learn on my own
too, to add sulfur, some kind of sulfur
[SPEAKER_02]: too, because I use KOR.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like a mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to add in a calcium carbonate,
like limestone or oyster shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a little bit of gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm getting my elemental calcium along
with my calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm also picking up some gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a good balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like using this term, but a liming
agent, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For lack of a better one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a request here on the history of
the strain, the one, which is one I've
[SPEAKER_02]: been fascinated with for a long time
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Laguna Beach in the late sixties and
early seventies before the whole LSD,
[SPEAKER_00]: the orange sunshine thing took them apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's one thing to taunt a dog
behind the fence with a stick,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you don't want to do that with the
federal government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when you're living in
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Containers of hash.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are like 48,000, you know,
I mean, these guys weren't just a dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to see the dude and get some
stashed it tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this was like, you know,
you got to buy even then 10 kilos to even
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so the C's came and a lot of
the guys, cause they're in the BOL,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was like, it had to be 13,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 original founding members.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so seven were a part of this ragtag
motorcycle club that used to hang out at
[SPEAKER_00]: this really weird bar, not far from
Disneyland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were just, you know, drinkers
and, you know, like rowdy bikers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the sixties, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was also this group of surfers in
the mid sixties that were traveling around
[SPEAKER_00]: the world as it was easy to do,
maybe easier than today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when surfing in the surfing spots all
had somebody there with good weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they started bringing some good weed
back because they knew how to pass their
[SPEAKER_00]: boards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can make a hole in the board and
stash in a pound or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's then the two got together
and then the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seed that I had were from Kandahar,
1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know exactly who brought them in the
whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I went off to the army and got
drafted, you know, kicking and screaming
[SPEAKER_00]: to send the women and children first,
but off to save the world and make it
[SPEAKER_00]: safer democracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came back and in December of 1976,
the first Thai sticks came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came in 10 kilo bales.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 of those pounds were sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then, it was still two or three
years away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were seedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was then two pounds of loose
buds that of course had to be renamed the
[SPEAKER_00]: Buddha buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those seeds became the first crop I
ever did that summer in 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was no grow stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no new program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even sure I even would know what
to do if I had a bottle of Maxi or Miracle
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow or whatever, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I understood that you had to water
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was before the banking laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could walk into a car dealer and buy
four Celicas if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pay cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was no big deal later in the Reagan
administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, yeah, just say no that
crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so that was a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were 10 plants that were
selected out of this mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I told you, you guys would be
laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was like flying by the seat of my
pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be real honest about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's early on, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one was really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were no seed companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guys in California were still
dinking around with goofy names,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a couple, but I wouldn't name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one, the way it got the name was
that they were all against the wall and
[SPEAKER_00]: they went from sativa over to Afghani
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no interest in it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just said, OK, the one over here is
mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, oh, so it's like the one,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's like the one over here is mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that became a running joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's still got the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's still got the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's just like, you know,
it has nothing to do with I thought it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, yeah, it's like the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I've had the one that came from Sri
Lanka and I didn't want to ever smoke weed
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like that far out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was like, yeah, some Hindus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, real Hindu, not any picked up in
New Delhi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like in the Cush Valley or
something, you know, from the side.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, no big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but ironic is that I've given that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never sold a cone in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last time I sold a seed was seventy
seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's early.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take Thai seeds, you know, because I had
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I learned early on that if I
was going to take the risk of being a
[SPEAKER_00]: serious consumer of cannabis, that you
might as well do the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would sell like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you have my I'm not, but I would
get fronted like a ton or two of Columbia
[SPEAKER_00]: from guys in Detroit with way too many
valves in their last name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd give you like two months to
turn it.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our motto was I don't want to own it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to fingerprint it,
meaning, you know, bump it twenty five,
[SPEAKER_00]: thirty bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I would turn around and go
buy like premium Mishra Khan or your O
[SPEAKER_00]: 'Hagan Spears for personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you went to Sears, you got a deep
freezer so I could freeze it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I could buy zero four pounds,
you know, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was, you know, can I just say one
thing about skunk number one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, going back to the like original in
the mid 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as like why it's called skunk in
the first place, you know, it's like I
[SPEAKER_00]: just don't get the whole thing about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, why is that desirable?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK, now I understand that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can I can understand that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my favorite is somebody will give me
a bud to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did you clone this more than twice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's made it through three rounds,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, yeah, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: One nice thing about growing an old strain
is that you really can test the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can't test the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this time I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, skittles or pittles or
whatever it's called, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm going to try this, sir,
but I'm going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know cookies or whatever the thing is,
you know, whatever the hot button is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with me, I mean, I can tell you by day
24, I'm not going to finish this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you let me try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, which is go back to the drawing
board.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in my opinion, which means nothing,
is that at least if I test something for
[SPEAKER_00]: you, I can give you an accurate comparison
analysis of one that I've grown like
[SPEAKER_00]: forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main reason people don't like mine is
that if you really want to get the full,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twilight Zone theme comes on right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do at least 12, if not 14
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the best part.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part I love the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taken it 18 weeks just to see what it
would take to get the trikes to turn even
[SPEAKER_00]: cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't ever happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're never going to get the amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let alone cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, never goes cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even outdoors, like seven months,
like Southern California, where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: take it through November into December.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never goes cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has to be the Highland Tye.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if you tried like way less light
hours, like six hours light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years, I've done every,
even when I was ignorant, got into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, you need this bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This bulb will make it finish.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This bulb will make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need this magic stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell you it's proprietary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, that's.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my, you know, just a guy that
decided to get into soil real serious and
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have posted on my IG feed of a soil test
that I mixed five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has all the NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has all the macro and micro nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're really weak in the
micro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's throw some kelp in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why kelp is the perfect one,
because it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it accumulates all 83 elements,
more importantly, in the right balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't go nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's adding some kelp will take care of
all our micronutrient issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I didn't even know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only brown kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not blue, green algae, not red,
but green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, green and red, but brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only brown is the only organism on this
planet that creates alginic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll leave you for research on that,
but you can see why brown kelp has alginic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seaweed extract is created by law under
federal USDA regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be created with either sodium
hydroxide or potassium hydroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff they use in Draino to clean out
your drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they use that and they burn everything
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you left with?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're left with powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might as well just do salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the life force is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it had a convenience that is
detrimental to your soil, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to put a fungicide in my soil
after I've spent several months building
[SPEAKER_00]: up the nutrient and fungal profile in my
compost before I ever hit a warm bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask you, are you self-researched and
you just delved into it hardcore and
[SPEAKER_02]: learned it all on your own?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm academically, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, this is pretty heavy
academic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the real stuff is that you have to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get your hands dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no bottle solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to have scratch in the
game, you got to do it and be consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't beat my phone because we released my
product today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey there, it's Patty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one with the malted barley,
malted heirloom corn, and hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where can people get this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, build a soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I named it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to sound cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gnarly barley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gnarly barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 50% barley and it's 30% corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for the cytokinins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the hemp, which I can spend a
couple of days explaining all the enzymes
[SPEAKER_00]: and compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it works good on a plant, it's probably
good for you and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The benefits from the hemp seed and all
malting means nothing more than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that you took a seed and you
germinated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you arrest it at about 116
Fahrenheit, but that does, it leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: the...
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets an interactive... Enzyme's intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call that diastatic malt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we take that malt after it's dried
and ready to store or use and we
[SPEAKER_00]: caramelize it for flavor or aroma for ales
and what have you, that's great,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it kills all the enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we call that non-diastatic malt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you use non-diastatic malt in your
beer formula, then you need to add the
[SPEAKER_00]: diastatic malt because you can't make beer
without amylase as the main player enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: in the barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not what we benefit from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I explain this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all plants produce chitinase and chitin
itself is an acetyl form of glucosamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All seashells contain are made up from
limestone or calcium carbonate.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the crustaceans, the crab,
the lobster, the shrimp, and I guess that
[SPEAKER_00]: would also include the one in the south,
crawdads, have chitin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chitin, for example, if you had
surgery, either oral or external,
[SPEAKER_00]: they probably sewed you up with chitin
string.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes back to like the 1880s.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has really got an interesting
connection So in 1922, this young man by
[SPEAKER_00]: the name of Albert Hoffman graduates from
Cologne University and his paper is on the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular structure of chitin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 21 years later, he would
introduce or find LSD 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 15 years after that, he was
commissioned to do the research on these
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms out of Oaxaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's the one that gave the name to the
two compounds psilocybin and psilocin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a 15 year period, here he does LSD
25.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read his book, LSD, My Problem Child.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write it down, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then anyway, so the only thing that
can deconstruct microly, that can
[SPEAKER_00]: deconstruct a polysaccharide is fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacteria, in their weak attempt to try to
deconstruct it, create an enzyme called
[SPEAKER_00]: chitinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chitinase deconstructs egg shells in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to use the poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then equally important, animal kingdom
and plant kingdom have immune systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in plants, you have like HAR,
hormonal acquired resistance and SAR,
[SPEAKER_00]: systemic acquired resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them are called pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important pathway in a plant's
defense system is the chitinase salicylic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every plant produces salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants produce copious amounts like
the aloe vera plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably heard in your career,
oh, you can use willow shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, that's salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, and so that's why people would use
aloe vera.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I know it started there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, look, man, I'm not climbing a
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go to a Mexican market and get a
fresh aloe vera leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just cut off the spiny stuff on
the sides and you stick your stems in
[SPEAKER_00]: there inside the gel and sit overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next day, put them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get into that one,
but however you do your cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that salicylic acid creates a barrier
against pathogenic fungi, your molds and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I average seriously over 98 percent
success using just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that's actually the best one is
you can find true, like the sign on the
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the road that says honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's never been touched.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just you straight honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight honey to root?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no clue about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got to get organic because what
they do to honey from the time they pull
[SPEAKER_00]: it from the beehive to, I guess,
in that jar with the little bear,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sad story.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not like the real deal,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so that's why if we use multi
grains in our soil, the chitinase,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to go through the expense
of using crab meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what you're really after is the
chitinase, not the chitin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you get it right in the malted
grains along with ures, urea, protease,
[SPEAKER_00]: protein, phosphatase, what cannabis grower
doesn't obsess about phosphorus,
right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much to their peril usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you get the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so there's like 360 enzymes in a
malted grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I can do and have done is I can
document, OK, here are the enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take something out from under your
finger now and put it in water and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can explain each one and how they
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm only taking like 10 out of the 360
that are in barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and then you add corn to the cytokinins
and what that does to between the tip of
[SPEAKER_00]: the root system and then the meristem at
the end of the branches is quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first cytokinin was discovered in
corn in 1937.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Latin name for corn is zea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they named this enzyme zeatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's and there's other there's other
PGRs and other things in the corn besides
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one enzyme, excuse me, a hormone.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I was just thinking about the
one I want to probably board your
[SPEAKER_00]: audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I think everybody's fucking loving
it, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to have you on any time you are
bored.
[SPEAKER_02]: Want to come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's a real treat for me and
everyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really appreciate it because I like
talking to gardeners instead of salesmen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever looked at my feed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Your what?
[SPEAKER_00]: My feed?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen some of the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one, the 10 and a half pounder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you think it's a little disingenuous
to come on my feed and tell me what I
[SPEAKER_00]: should be doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my good Lord.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's everybody's a scholar.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I want to say is maybe like do
more reading and not so much editorial
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, you know, till you kind of I figure
I've been involved in at least,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, at least 300, 325 serious gardens in
my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I imagine so, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, the first slice I ever bought was
from George.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called George Cervantes then before
he became Jorge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A place here in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of three growth stores in
Portland at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went and bought these Dutch lights
from PL Light Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the professional stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to burn down my house in
Orange County, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, trying to grow some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decide there was, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funding was available, I'll leave it at
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, we decided to set it up first
cabin and I was using what do you call
[SPEAKER_00]: them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Dosatrons 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And buying like full jugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there were five gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, dying to grow and dying of
bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd write down to there was some in the
Bay Area like San Jose, something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we just put the Dosatron inside the
jugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I did this drip system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, by today's standards, you guys got
it made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's all off the shelf and play
for the most part, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to kind of like, huh, so how are we
going to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, which is like one time pulling
stuff out of the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And staging it next to the pickup trucks
and.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that was like our leader,
I called him OPH, our personal hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, I just said,
hey, Thumbdick, have you given a thought
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're going to drive this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody just looks down at the
ground like, oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were using bull tacos to go back
into the forest to get the plants where
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm bringing them back and stage them,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Horacio, I know he's friends with some
of the Northern Lights crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you interact with those guys at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all, because that came out of
what they called the BCGA, the British
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia Growers Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the NL came out of Canada on a guy
that broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: The BCGA wasn't going to do business with
any of the two groups that came out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland, what is now called Sensei Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it was called the SSSC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Neville and his partner,
David Watson.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, they wandered around and
everybody had cash, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, briefcases full of cash and they
were buying seeds and cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Northern Light came out from a
grower in Canada that said, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, you know, you cut hay when the sun
shines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got money?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how the NL thing went over to
Neville's deal, the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the only thing I ever bought
seeds in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought them one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hay's Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you find any keepers in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you find good stuff in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I never bought another seed again in my
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, every story I hear about older
growers that were growing the Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: Lights Hay's in a Tay Day, they all have
very, very fond memories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they talk about how many keepers were
found that became like well-known
[SPEAKER_02]: clonomies that are still around nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there is a caveat to my comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make this is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where you're getting conflicting
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a case that I was indirectly,
I wasn't involved, but I was on the
[SPEAKER_00]: possible list of come talk to us back in
Boston.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in discovery, it came out that the DEA
and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Postal Service was intercepting letters
from the seed banks to customers here and
[SPEAKER_00]: they were switching it out with ditch weed
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was in discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what they came to the,
you know, here's our evidence,
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence, whatever they call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an attorney, but they all sit
around before they do lunch or something
[SPEAKER_00]: and you said how they're going to screw
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, that just like it clicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But have you ever noticed how many times
in your life you've been back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: foreign day before to social media like
ICMAG or grass and all that?
[SPEAKER_00]: People go, well, my plants sure don't look
like the pictures from the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just used to think, I don't even
want to open this can of worms,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be hated on forever for spilling that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are going to realize their
collection is worthless and then they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to really dislike the messenger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but no, that's honest to God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just went, well, that party is over,
you know, so let's go back to square one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know because we know who brought
them into the United States and the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: history and who who had possession of them
and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have a lot of confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: One greeter here that a farmer,
what do they call him, gave me 13 samples
[SPEAKER_00]: in those little jars with, you know,
yeah, probably a whole, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: half a gram or half an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl scout cookies to this, to that,
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them in a bag and I brought them
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were going to hire me as a
consultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my wife's in a kitchen cooking
dinner and I sat down in the living room
[SPEAKER_00]: and I opened one up and I smelled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went, God, that's really terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pulled out a noug and I busted it up
and I put it in my pipe and I got half a
[SPEAKER_00]: hit and I just put it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife comes around the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: She goes, what's that smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, oh, it's and I don't want to
name it because I'll get, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, but it's one that everybody has to
have or you're just a complete dickhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not growing this one,
you're a dickhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just said and so I, you know,
I was really polite, but I said and I
[SPEAKER_00]: called the next day and said, I just don't
see any connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like redo your soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's just more issues here than
I can even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I need like the biggest spreadsheet
known to God to even get into the science
[SPEAKER_00]: of why this thing fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I wish you the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, one season was over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first year it went legal
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was funny money everywhere from
Asian banks, from European banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who do they hire?
[SPEAKER_00]: A grow store clerk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your grow guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need another CalMag lockout to handle
this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no there's no purpose in
consulting for someone that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: hire idiots all along the side of you to
perform, you know, complex shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm and I'm enough of an egotist and a
clown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't tolerate fools lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, hey, go do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, instant karma, whatever,
you know, yada yada yada.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm here to grow real medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole industry is like that,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had just made my my entrance into the
hemp industry last year, and I was shocked
[SPEAKER_02]: at how many people are playing grower in
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really thought I never fucked with it
because I figured there are people that
[SPEAKER_02]: are that are better than I would be at
doing it because they've been studying
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically hemp longer and working with
it longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured they had that shit fucking
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And boy, was I confused when I got in
there and saw the people were just playing
[SPEAKER_02]: constantly playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without wheels and, you know, proprietary
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't tell you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I mean, if they think about
it this way, the issues facing the human
[SPEAKER_00]: race isn't whether Johnny gets his dank on
is how are we going to feed people?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this crap work, they'd be sitting
in front of the U.N., picking up checks
[SPEAKER_00]: for billions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: On solving world hunger.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to me, it's that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why, like on my new product,
I'm donating percent of my compensation to
[SPEAKER_00]: an agency that plants forest around the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think, you know, I just think Hey,
I want everybody to get their dank on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if some like newt line, I want to do a
line called Coots Newts spelled OTS within
[SPEAKER_00]: OTS Coots Newts, you know, and I'll just
say, look, this is what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeding your deal, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Dharma, whatever it is you think you
have to do to grow a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And goodbye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's my honor to have you on and I'd
love to have you on again any time,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Fred.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a treat that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's so smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to go rewatch that several
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for everyone stopping in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks again to Coots.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was our first conversation that we've
had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I was privileged and an honor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care, guys.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
