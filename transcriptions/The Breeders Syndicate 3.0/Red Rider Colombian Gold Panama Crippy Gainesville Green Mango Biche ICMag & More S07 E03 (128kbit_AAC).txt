[SPEAKER_03]: great to have you joining us and sharing
the info You know, I remember that some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the first stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I I read from you was talking about Your
your youth, you know, we're about the same
[SPEAKER_03]: age so you were smoking in the 70s and and
and early 80s and and you were telling
[SPEAKER_03]: your stories about what it was like You
know your early days when you first got
[SPEAKER_03]: high and some different experiences and
places you lived around cannabis Can you
[SPEAKER_03]: tell us a little bit about kind of those
early days and how you got into weed?
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh Sure Dude ranch in Colorado when I was
about 10 years old and that was my first
[SPEAKER_17]: experience seeing cannabis I didn't smoke
it or get high but I noticed it was that
[SPEAKER_17]: they said it was even Colombian but We had
a campfire everybody was sitting around
[SPEAKER_17]: and they were smoking it the older guys
and everything and they really had a
[SPEAKER_17]: really good experience with it and of
course, it was a Few years later when I
[SPEAKER_17]: actually smoked some and got high but that
was later when I I think it was a very
[SPEAKER_17]: similar story to like you were talking
about where after school I I was riding
[SPEAKER_17]: home on the bus and this guy had some
joints for sale and He said it's really
[SPEAKER_17]: really good man.
[SPEAKER_17]: I and and I gave him a dollar bought two
of them and wrapped in nice pink rolling
[SPEAKER_17]: papers and When I got off the school bus,
I had like a little entourage with me You
[SPEAKER_17]: know that was wanting to see what happened
when we smoked it And we went out in the
[SPEAKER_17]: woods and that was when I first really
felt it realized This is something I
[SPEAKER_17]: wanted to keep with me in my life Wow But
it was Mexican the first time you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you remember that and I remember
that whole that whole picture You just
[SPEAKER_03]: painted man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can I can still I can a picture the
joints You know the paper look like it was
[SPEAKER_03]: so thick, you know You couldn't see
anything through it and the ends Were
[SPEAKER_03]: probably spun and twisted and if it unspun
the whole thing would just dump out,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Because it was powdery in there
and and the kids I can't even imagine the
[SPEAKER_03]: excitement of the kids kind of chasing
along trying to find a place to hide in
[SPEAKER_03]: some bushes or some crap, you know as you
were You know just the pure innocence of
[SPEAKER_03]: that introduction moment and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's great writer I love the story
and I think we all identify with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, that's very familiar going with
your friends and everybody waiting To see
[SPEAKER_06]: who's gonna smoke it first and who's gonna
have the first reaction Yeah, and of
[SPEAKER_03]: course I guess that first time around the
campfire Did you actually smoke with those
[SPEAKER_03]: older dudes and not experience not get
high?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or was it you watched them do it and
thought oh, this is okay Maybe I'll
[SPEAKER_17]: someday later you tried it Well,
actually that was a this is a ghost story.
[SPEAKER_17]: We were camping up in the mountains in
Colorado in between Vail and Steamboat
[SPEAKER_17]: Springs and we were we were probably at
12,000 feet way up on top of this mountain
[SPEAKER_17]: and I I I just watched them smoke a little
bit of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: But in the morning that my cousin who was
a little bit older than I Told me.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh man, there were ghosts last night But
didn't you hear all the horses and all the
[SPEAKER_17]: Indians and everything and I look up to no
man I remember any of that Wow,
[SPEAKER_17]: but apparently they woke up in the middle
of the night hearing horses stampeding
[SPEAKER_17]: through the little Valley we were in and
it just get louder and louder and louder
[SPEAKER_17]: and no nothing appeared and it scared the
shit out all these guys But I didn't hear
[SPEAKER_17]: any of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I only heard the story and they said man I
do remember them saying man that Colombian
[SPEAKER_17]: is like like psychedelic, you know Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so they heard things that you
couldn't hear Yeah, it was a ghost story
[SPEAKER_17]: that they used to tell and I was there
when it happened, but I I saw I certainly
[SPEAKER_17]: didn't hear any horses or anything like
that But I do remember that the smell of
[SPEAKER_17]: the weed was really really sweet something
I really liked the smell of That's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey red, you know, I should have said this
right at the beginning you're you know
[SPEAKER_03]: what my my Awareness of you and and your
experience the story you're telling is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be focused very much about
Colombian weed and the country of Colombia
[SPEAKER_03]: And your love affair with both of those
and and how what's where that's taking you
[SPEAKER_03]: right through life, so Because you've got
a great story to tell there and most
[SPEAKER_03]: people, you know If you're looking at you
on there, you're not you're not from
[SPEAKER_03]: Colombia, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're an American from you know,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So start let's start talking about that
that That Colombian weed you were saying
[SPEAKER_03]: what what year was this?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah the first time you smoke you didn't
well Let me tell you about the first time
[SPEAKER_17]: and I left out an important character and
that was Becky Becky was a 16 year old.
[SPEAKER_17]: This was the last day of school And she
when she found out I had the marijuana
[SPEAKER_17]: when I had the two joints her her her
disposition to me changed and she became
[SPEAKER_17]: very attentive and I was I suddenly
realized that Man, this weed really gets
[SPEAKER_17]: her excited.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, she's yeah so we we walked down
towards the lake with a little group of
[SPEAKER_17]: smaller children following us and as we
got to a certain Place we lit up the joint
[SPEAKER_17]: and when I I noticed when we lit the joint
all the little kids were gone But I I gave
[SPEAKER_17]: it to her She took a couple big hits and
she grabbed my arm and said hey come here
[SPEAKER_17]: and she put the joint in her mouth You
know for a shotgun.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah and gave me a big shotgun kiss Yeah,
and I felt it man.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean I that shit that was the first hit
of that joint, but man I felt it right
[SPEAKER_17]: away and we smoked the rest of That joint
and we walked down to the I was high as
[SPEAKER_17]: hell.
[SPEAKER_17]: Everything was just incredibly It was
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_17]: The Sun was out birds were out we walked
to this really secluded part of the lake
[SPEAKER_17]: and she just took her clothes off and went
into the water and I was as women tend to
[SPEAKER_17]: do around all of us I didn't I should have
jumped on that but I didn't I was just too
[SPEAKER_17]: much in why she said come on in so I went
in my clothes
[SPEAKER_03]: That shotgun that shotgun kiss is like was
like the sexiest thing Yeah, right
[SPEAKER_03]: combining your two favorite things in the
world Right up.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a good way to get a girl to kiss
you too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah Well, and she did it was even
better All right, so then she goes she's
[SPEAKER_17]: in the water but I never told her I had
another joint and I kept that other one I
[SPEAKER_17]: went back home and I ate and I was with my
parents and everything and I thought man I
[SPEAKER_17]: still have a whole nother join of that So
I turned on my best friend.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's like my friend of 40 years 50 now and
After that we started trying to grow it
[SPEAKER_17]: You know from all the seeds and we never
really got any plants but but that started
[SPEAKER_17]: the my quest where I would buy buy every
week I was working then I was 13 but I had
[SPEAKER_17]: a job and every week when I got paid I'd
go to the Yamaha dealership and The
[SPEAKER_17]: mechanic would sell me a nice lid of Mexi,
you know Nice It was a great summer Yeah,
[SPEAKER_17]: yeah, we we rode dirt bikes all summer
down by this lake and we just get high I
[SPEAKER_17]: met some other guys that got me high down
there with some really good like tie stick
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow But you know I already knew there was
really good weed around even though all I
[SPEAKER_17]: could buy was you know shit weed But we
were reading high times.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, and the high times I but to me high
times was like a penthouse You know,
[SPEAKER_17]: it's like I knew it existed, but it wasn't
what I was getting very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they were Yeah Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh I was just I was just thinking you know
that um, that's my exact same experience I
[SPEAKER_03]: had a very good friend, you know through
high school as I was doing all this stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know side-by-side We were we were we
were a real pair and it sounds like you
[SPEAKER_03]: had that that same experience I'm sure
that's pretty common, you know I think
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just so refreshing to get people to
come on now who've been you know chasing
[SPEAKER_03]: this this thing for so long and who who
admit when they weren't a huge og og
[SPEAKER_03]: baller and when things went wrong and how
it was it they didn't start off,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know with a hundred acres of you know
of stuff they they started off with three
[SPEAKER_03]: plants in a shadow and You know and it
changed everything right so I think I
[SPEAKER_03]: think you You know that honesty makes it
just so refreshing compared to I mean look
[SPEAKER_03]: there are people out there who have done
big big big stuff and I respect them I
[SPEAKER_03]: know it's real love hearing the stories
But there's also people out there front
[SPEAKER_03]: and that they're they're more than and
were more than what they really were And I
[SPEAKER_03]: just like I like the honest red I guess so
please continue the one chick and what
[SPEAKER_17]: happened was the other I went I took them
to my parents house who weren't there my
[SPEAKER_17]: parents weren't there and I tried to get
them to come in to listen to some music
[SPEAKER_17]: and they said nah, it looked a little
dangerous in the house and but the
[SPEAKER_17]: Colombian girl Uchi uchi she said yeah,
I'll go in with him one thing led to
[SPEAKER_17]: another and I started seeing her by
herself and One night I bought some really
[SPEAKER_17]: good lumbo, man I mean this was a good
fifty forty five dollar lid of lumbo and I
[SPEAKER_17]: thought it was just Really really good.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, and I was with her and I said look
you have to try this you have to try this
[SPEAKER_17]: it's from your country and and Believe it
or not.
[SPEAKER_17]: She took a hit of it and and threw it down
that we were outside She threw it on the
[SPEAKER_17]: ground and I was like, hey But between her
lovely cleavage she pulled out a joint man
[SPEAKER_17]: and she said now this is good weed and She
lit that shit up and that's when I really
[SPEAKER_17]: had some good good connoisseur Colombian
But also fell in love with her,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, I mean it was kind of a
combination thing there.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I bet Oh, yeah, then I had to know
more about Colombia I but she left she was
[SPEAKER_17]: there for three weeks and went back to
Colombia and never heard from her again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man That is the best Colombian love
story ever, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Red red red that is the best Colombian
love story ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh, so awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow What happened after that Yeah,
we didn't get all of the American part of
[SPEAKER_03]: the story yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we?
[SPEAKER_17]: No, this was the the first time I got high
and I don't know why but I'd smoked it
[SPEAKER_17]: before I mean I'd smoked weed before yeah
Yeah, but I think that's common for a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of us like the first time we we smoke We
don't quite know what to what we're gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know how much to smoke We don't
really maybe sometimes don't know how how
[SPEAKER_06]: to inhale correctly at that point
depending on if we smoke cigarettes or not
[SPEAKER_06]: by that age and I think Our brain just
doesn't know how to process it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't understand the high So like it
takes three or four times to where you're
[SPEAKER_06]: like, ah, this is comfortable,
you know Yeah, then you know what to
[SPEAKER_16]: expect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know when the boys in the lab coats
start talking about Cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know from the end the
endocannabinoid system and you think About
[SPEAKER_03]: the first time you flood those things with
an external Cannabinoid it's really cool
[SPEAKER_03]: because you know mate who knows maybe
maybe like the first time you do that It's
[SPEAKER_03]: like whoa, you know your cannabinoids are
all Yeah for personalizing of writers,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, whoa You know, they're they're
really reacting to this flood of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know what to do with it Maybe
they they shut down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah the first time right maybe I'm
blocking I'm just throwing this shit out
[SPEAKER_03]: there man that stuff we were smoking had
been through hell before it got to us So
[SPEAKER_06]: have you writer have you heard of
something called CHS out there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I think it's cannabinoid hypermesis
syndrome?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's fairly new and It's something
that they've been pushing like so I both
[SPEAKER_06]: my brother or and my cousin have gone to
the ER recently with some cyclic vomiting
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of like I have to like and They the
nurses keep pushing this idea that it's
[SPEAKER_06]: from something called CHS cannabinoid
hypermesis syndrome so it's something and
[SPEAKER_06]: I started doing research into it and one
of my good friends is an ER doctor and
[SPEAKER_06]: he's a he's a smoker too, so he's been
really researching this because he started
[SPEAKER_06]: having similar symptoms and From what they
can tell early on the research thought
[SPEAKER_06]: they thought maybe it's from crops sprayed
with neem oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah But they're not sure if that really
is the case They're not sure if it's from
[SPEAKER_06]: you know Heavy use of extracts since a lot
of people randomly use extracts with flour
[SPEAKER_06]: and and it's just too much for our systems
But whatever it is, it's inducing Cyclical
[SPEAKER_06]: vomiting in people just like day after day
after day of endless puking in people But
[SPEAKER_06]: they just don't know why and and they call
it cannabinoid hypermesis syndrome,
[SPEAKER_06]: but realistically it could be related to
terpenes it could be related to an Unknown
[SPEAKER_06]: or an untested for cannabinoid,
you know, not THC, but it could be you
[SPEAKER_06]: know, God knows what else but yeah It's an
interesting one that's gonna be popping up
[SPEAKER_03]: more and more Yeah, maybe the presence of
Foreign stuff and concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean none of this really happened until
there was a legal market and yeah There's
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of causation, you know correlation
causation type stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah probably going on but you know,
I I did you talk to any of your family
[SPEAKER_03]: about the Theory I talked with you about
about the effects of breathing superheated
[SPEAKER_06]: shit from butane torches No, so Neither of
them do that, but they they both are very
[SPEAKER_06]: heavy like vape cartridge users Like the
carts like the isolate cart shit,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know remember the guy that Used to
measure that used to measure this mystery
[SPEAKER_03]: oil and all the available butane on the
market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Yeah Yeah, I get frustrated with
science these days because they all have
[SPEAKER_03]: these other agendas, you know,
it's just like well, where's the well then
[SPEAKER_17]: I moved to Florida because my father my
stepmother lived in West Palm Beach And
[SPEAKER_17]: that's where I had the Dan the painter man
story.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's where the guy He was a drug dealer
lived right upstairs and he was getting
[SPEAKER_17]: all these fantastic imports coming through
South Florida at the time and In fact,
[SPEAKER_17]: that's when I first saw the the first
Indica.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh Wow, what year?
[SPEAKER_17]: That was that was actually the spring of
1980.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_17]: Perfect and I didn't know it was Indica.
[SPEAKER_17]: As a matter of fact, I only read about
Indica and high times I really didn't know
[SPEAKER_17]: what it was and I did grow plants.
[SPEAKER_17]: I started growing plants in Texas in the
late 70s, but I didn't know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't know how to flower them or or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that why you moved to Columbia because
they just do you can't mess it up and and
[SPEAKER_17]: I went to Cartagena in 2002 February
January 2002 met her online, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: I met her online Had I I thought man,
I want to I want to find a woman You know,
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to meet a woman and I thought where
where should I find where what what woman
[SPEAKER_17]: would I want?
[SPEAKER_17]: So I started looking in Columbia Okay,
when I say looking there was a program
[SPEAKER_17]: called I see her What was it?
[SPEAKER_17]: I see Q I see Q.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah And it allowed you to do specific
searches women between the age this age
[SPEAKER_17]: speak English and I flooded every one of
them with a generic letter saying hello.
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is James.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm a gringo I'm interested in meeting
someone and I got many replies back.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, pardon me and as I was Responding to
these replies.

and this is a beautiful valley man This is
[SPEAKER_17]: where you want to grow.

best gotcha and we'll get there But she
[SPEAKER_17]: lived in the middle of it and we weren't
friends about weed.

[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Beautiful, beautiful nickel, nickel size
brown buds.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the smell.
[SPEAKER_17]: I open that bag and oh, man, I was right
back in the in the 70s, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we had changed hotels to the Hilton.
[SPEAKER_17]: For some reason, I got a really good rate
on this beautiful, incredible room
[SPEAKER_17]: overlooking the lagoon in Cartagena.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I wanted to roll that shit up.
[SPEAKER_17]: First thing I did was I ran out on the
balcony and got my papers and started
[SPEAKER_17]: breaking it down.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I looked around and I thought,
where the hell is she at?
[SPEAKER_17]: And she had went in the bathroom and
locked the door.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was like, don't worry, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I lift that up and I got high as
hell.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I knocked on the door and I was like,
hey, hey.
[SPEAKER_17]: And she said, what?
[SPEAKER_17]: She opened up the door and I stand in
there with an erection from hell,
[SPEAKER_17]: man.
[SPEAKER_17]: This does this to you.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it was a beautiful romantic experience
with the Colombian again, again.
[SPEAKER_06]: She locked the door.
[SPEAKER_06]: So was she scared of like the consequences
if someone might smell it and the cops
[SPEAKER_06]: coming or?
[SPEAKER_17]: No, she was afraid it was going to make me
go crazy because they they don't think of
[SPEAKER_17]: drugs like we do.
[SPEAKER_17]: They they really don't.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a narco state and the normal
people, the regular people don't they
[SPEAKER_17]: don't fuck with drugs.
[SPEAKER_17]: They just don't do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Alcoholics, you know, you like drinking
come here.
[SPEAKER_17]: They drink more than Germans.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we have 22 holidays a year.
[SPEAKER_17]: Twenty two.
[SPEAKER_17]: You have five in the United States.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: So there always is always a festival,
a party or a reason to get drunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, makes sense.
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't smoke no weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Narco states are weird, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it makes sense, though, because of the
propaganda that the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: had pushed down there so hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we got a big case of it here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because, you know, by the by the
80s, I think most people in the country
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of realized it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are huge parts of the population
who just bought it hook, line and sinker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they just bought it and
they passed it down to their children and
[SPEAKER_03]: just repeated its myths.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very powerful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, she must she was scared.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was legitimate.
[SPEAKER_03]: We scared you were going to come back and
be like the crazy guy from playing the
[SPEAKER_03]: piano and Reefer Madness, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're while we're here in in like
the DEA propaganda territory.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't we cover some of the parts about
the perceptions of Colombia and the
[SPEAKER_06]: dangerous parts, like how dangerous it is
or isn't to go there and the perception
[SPEAKER_06]: from America?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that and your your fears when you
first went there, what were your concerns?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, when I was doing a lot of
traveling in South America in the 90s,
[SPEAKER_09]: Colombia was the one place I didn't go
because it was so sketchy that right now,
[SPEAKER_09]: it seems like very comfortable and nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's all kinds of travel in and
out.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was by far the most violent and
sketchy place, you know, in the 90s,
[SPEAKER_17]: at least in the 90s was probably Pablo
Escobar.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it was it was like I mean,
my dad has some crazy stories of going
[SPEAKER_09]: there on business and stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, now it's like reversed.
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to Venezuela because Colombia was
trashed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now it's reversed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like nobody goes to Venezuela and Colombia
is like super nice and like beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure it was then, too.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just was not so accessible.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, you got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, if you if you if you come down
here and you go on the street,
[SPEAKER_17]: act like a fool, act like a rock star,
you're going to get they're going to get
[SPEAKER_17]: you.
[SPEAKER_17]: But if you're if you're polite,
respectful and not stupid, a lot of guys
[SPEAKER_17]: get jacked when they come down here buying
cocaine or buying prostitutes.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's how they get you with the
women.
[SPEAKER_17]: You've heard us, Scott, the drug that I
forget what they call it, but they blow
[SPEAKER_17]: this stuff in your face and rob you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go, Palomino.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, is it like deterra powder?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Generally speaking, when I when I would
travel in Central and South America,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, I would wear crappy clothes.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I would I would not know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would not want to know.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is like way nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you just like growing up in a big
city.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to not look like a mark.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_17]: I blend in.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I've worked here.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've lived in the worst barrios in Bogota.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, this is the red light zone where
it's very cheap prostitutes, really a bad
[SPEAKER_17]: area.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I never had a problem because I was
just very conscious of what was going on
[SPEAKER_17]: around me.
[SPEAKER_17]: I never had anything to steal.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: The only thing I have that's of value is
weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: And here weed doesn't have very much
value.
[SPEAKER_17]: But to me, it's worth more than money.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I said, the first my first love in
nineteen seventy seven was seventy eight
[SPEAKER_17]: or was seventy nine with the first
Colombian girl that I met, Uchi Rion.
[SPEAKER_17]: She smoked, but she was from a very rich
family.
[SPEAKER_17]: As in regards to security, a lot of it's
common sense, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want to go out and play the fool,
you want to go out and and and hook up
[SPEAKER_17]: with prostitutes on Tinder, shit like
that, you're going to get jacked.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, you walk down the street and
counting your money, speaking in English,
[SPEAKER_17]: you're going to get jacked.
[SPEAKER_17]: They'll come right out in the middle of
the day.
[SPEAKER_17]: The police only protect you here if you're
paying them.
[SPEAKER_17]: There is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_17]: So what?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's I mean, that's a nice direct
contract.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least, you know, you can get
protection.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, you know, I don't know
if you could do that in the States.
[SPEAKER_17]: And if they're not dangerous, it's not.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not any more dangerous than if you
walk down downtown St. Louis or Fulton
[SPEAKER_17]: County, Atlanta.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: You're going to get jacked quicker there
because you look different.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, Matt.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_17]: I said, man, you look like a Pisa guy.
[SPEAKER_17]: You look like you're from.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can probably pass down.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Until they heard me speak Spanish or any
of that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Then they just that's when they know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to borrow Jorge Cervantes wig
when I go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that'll get you anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll blend right in.
[SPEAKER_17]: But let me tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_17]: The Colombian people in general are very,
very friendly, very welcoming,
[SPEAKER_17]: very hospitable.
[SPEAKER_17]: They love foreigners.
[SPEAKER_17]: The girls are really attracted to to the
North Americans, you know, and they're
[SPEAKER_17]: they want to be friends with Americans.
[SPEAKER_17]: Colombia is a very they believe the United
States is a great, great country and helps
[SPEAKER_17]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're down.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're down in Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're down in Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don, the painter is upstairs slinging.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Slinging weed and whatever else you try.
[SPEAKER_03]: You tried Indica and you're growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: All this is happening in Florida.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, yeah, this was Boca Raton.
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember going to see Bob Seeger and the
Silver Bullet Band at Easter.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a big concert at the Hollywood
Sportatorium.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I remember I had to have a bag of gold
to take with me to impress everybody.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_17]: And Dan scored me some, but it was more
orange.
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't the gold like I had in Texas.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is more of an orange.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was really good, but different.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: We went to that concert and there was some
beautiful hippie chick that came up to us
[SPEAKER_17]: and said, hey, you look like you need an
Easter kiss.
[SPEAKER_17]: And my brother was on that like like that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: But actually, I tried some another
Colombian that she just gave us a bag of
[SPEAKER_17]: weed and it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was green, though, real green Colombian
had the smell, had the taste.
[SPEAKER_17]: But, yeah, Dan got every kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: He got the Gainesville green.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if you guys ever heard of
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you talk about that a little bit,
like your early experience with the smell
[SPEAKER_06]: or maybe possibly describe the smell and
look of Gainesville green or what you
[SPEAKER_06]: thought might be in it?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, Gainesville green reminded me now of
what I what I grow is Oaxacan.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very similar, but it wasn't similar
to Oaxacan back then.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it was green.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was since the media and it had a
real piney.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how it's real piney,
tiny, real nice, high, real, real clear.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I like is clear clarity.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Which, unfortunately, most Colombians
weren't back then.
[SPEAKER_17]: The red was like a really, really dirty
high kind of.
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, the Gainesville green,
the Maui, the Maui Waui.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Came in a came in a can of nuts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, I read that they are heard
that, you know, like shipping it over in
[SPEAKER_09]: macadamia nut cans was a big thing back
then.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so wild.
[SPEAKER_17]: The full tap top opened it up and just
incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes sense for smell to hide the
smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything smart.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was teasing me with it.
[SPEAKER_17]: He started to let me smell it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Pull it away.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they never found his body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never saw it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'm I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's start talking about that that
that Colombian weed you were saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: What year was this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: First time you smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, let me tell you about the first
time.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I left out an important character,
and that was Becky.
[SPEAKER_17]: Becky was a 16 year old.
[SPEAKER_17]: This was the last day of school.
[SPEAKER_17]: And when she found out I had the
marijuana, when I had the two joints,
[SPEAKER_17]: her her her disposition to me changed and
she became very attentive.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was I suddenly realized that,
man, this weed really gets her excited,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we we walked down towards the lake with
a little group of smaller children
[SPEAKER_17]: following us.
[SPEAKER_17]: And as we got to a certain place,
we lit up the joint.
[SPEAKER_17]: And when I noticed when we lit the joint,
all the little little kids were gone.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I gave it to her.
[SPEAKER_17]: She took a couple of big hits and she
grabbed my arm and said, hey, come here.
[SPEAKER_17]: And she put the joint in her mouth,
you know, for a shotgun.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And gave me a big shotgun kiss.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I felt it, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I that shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: That was the first hit of that joint.
[SPEAKER_17]: But man, I felt it right away.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we smoked the rest of that joint and
we walked down to the I was high as hell.
[SPEAKER_17]: Everything was just incredibly it was
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_17]: The sun was out.
[SPEAKER_17]: Birds were out.
[SPEAKER_17]: We walked to this really secluded part of
the lake.
[SPEAKER_17]: And she just took her clothes off and went
into the water.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was as women tend to do around all
of us.
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't I should have jumped on that,
but I didn't.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just too much in.
[SPEAKER_17]: Why?
[SPEAKER_17]: She said, come on in.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I went in my clothes.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it was an excellent experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shotgun, that shotgun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shotgun kiss is like was like the sexiest
thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Combining your two favorite things in the
world.
Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a good way to get a girl to kiss
you, too.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, she and she did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was even better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then she goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's in the water.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I never told her I had another joint
and I kept that other one.
[SPEAKER_17]: I went back home and ate and I was with my
parents and everything.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I thought, man, I still have a whole
nother join of that.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I turned on my best friend.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's like my friend of 40 years,
50 now.
[SPEAKER_17]: And after that, we started trying to grow
it, you know, from all the seeds.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we never really got any plants.
[SPEAKER_17]: But but that started my quest where I
would buy by every week.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was working then I was 13, but I had a
job.
[SPEAKER_17]: And every week when I got paid,
I'd go to the Yamaha dealership and the
[SPEAKER_17]: mechanic would sell me a nice lid of
Mexican, you know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a great summer.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: We rode dirt bikes all summer down by this
lake.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we just get high.
[SPEAKER_17]: I met some other guys that got me high
down there with some really good like tie
[SPEAKER_17]: stick.
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, I already knew there was
really good weed around, even though all I
[SPEAKER_17]: could buy was, you know, shit weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: But we were really high times.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the high times.
[SPEAKER_17]: But to me, high times is like a penthouse.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's like I knew it existed,
but it wasn't what I was getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was just I was just thinking,
you know, that that's my exact same
[SPEAKER_03]: experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a very good friend, you know,
through high school as I was doing all
[SPEAKER_03]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, side by side, we were we were we
were a real pair.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds like you had that same
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that's pretty common.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think it's just so refreshing
to get people to come on now who've been
[SPEAKER_03]: chasing this thing for so long and who who
admit when they weren't a huge OG baller
[SPEAKER_03]: and when things went wrong and how it was
they didn't start off, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: with 100 acres of, you know, of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They they started off with three plants in
a shadow and.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it changed everything,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think I think you, you know,
that honesty makes it just so refreshing
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to I mean, look, there are people
out there who have done big, big,
[SPEAKER_03]: big stuff and I respect them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's real love hearing the stories,
but there's also people out there front
[SPEAKER_03]: and that they're they're more than and
were more than what they really were.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just like I like the honest red,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please continue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we didn't get all of the American
part of the story yet, did we?
[SPEAKER_17]: No, this was the first time I got high.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't know why, but I'd smoked it
before.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I'd smoked weed before.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that's common for a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the first time we we smoke,
we don't quite know what we're what we're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know how much to smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't really maybe sometimes don't know
how how to inhale correctly at that point,
[SPEAKER_06]: depending on if we smoke cigarettes or not
by that age.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think our brain just doesn't know
how to process it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't understand the high.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like it takes three or four times to
where you're like, oh, this is
[SPEAKER_06]: comfortable, you know.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Then you know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when the boys in the lab coats
start talking about cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that from the end, the
endocannabinoid system, you think about
[SPEAKER_03]: the first time you flood those things with
an external cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool because, you know,
who knows, maybe maybe like the first time
[SPEAKER_03]: you do that, it's like, whoa, you know,
your cannabinoids are all personalizing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, you know, whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're really reacting to this
flood of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they shut down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm blocking or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just throwing this shit out there,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That stuff we were smoking had been
through hell before it got to us.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you writer, have you heard of
something called CHS out there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I think it's cannabinoid hypermesis
syndrome?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's fairly new.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's something that they've been
pushing like.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I both my brother and my cousin have
gone to the ER recently with some cyclic
[SPEAKER_06]: vomiting, kind of like I have to like,
and they, the nurses keep pushing this
[SPEAKER_06]: idea that it's from something called CHS
cannabinoid hypermesis syndrome.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's something, and I started doing
research into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of my good friends is an ER doctor
and he's a, he's a smoker too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's been really researching this
because he started having similar
[SPEAKER_06]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from what they can tell early on the
research thought they thought maybe it's
[SPEAKER_06]: from a crop sprayed with neem oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're not sure if that really is the
case.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not sure if it's from,
you know, heavy use of extracts since a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of people randomly use extracts with
flour and it just too much for our
[SPEAKER_06]: systems, but whatever it is, it's inducing
a cyclical vomiting in people just like
[SPEAKER_06]: day after day after day of endless puking
in people, but they just don't know why.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they call it cannabinoid hypermesis
syndrome, but realistically it could be
[SPEAKER_06]: related to terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be related to an unknown or
untested for cannabinoid, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: not THC, but it could be, you know,
God knows what else, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be popping up more and
more.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the presence of, of foreign stuff
and concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, none of this really happened until
there was a, a legal market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of causation, you know,
correlation causation type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably going on, but you know,
I, I, did you, uh, talk to any of your
[SPEAKER_03]: family about the theory I talked with you
about, about the effects of breathing
[SPEAKER_03]: superheated shit from a butane torches?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so neither of them do that,
but they, they both are very heavy,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, like vape cartridge users,
like the cart, like the isolate cart shit,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I remember the guy that,
that used to measure, that used to measure
[SPEAKER_03]: this mystery oil and all the available
butane on the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That guy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get frustrated with science these days
because they all have these other agendas,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's just like, where's the
money coming from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Since you're familiar with all the
Mexicans and everything, do you,
[SPEAKER_03]: when you, uh, that Maui, um, the can of
Maui, did it, did it remind you,
[SPEAKER_03]: were there any Mexican traits to the,
any, any similarity at all?
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, no, I never had cannabis like that
before or since it had a real flowery,
[SPEAKER_17]: uh, you could feel the islands in it.
[SPEAKER_17]: You could feel that tropical sunshine when
you hit it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't get very much.
[SPEAKER_17]: He, he, he, I couldn't buy it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was too expensive, but I would just
kind of hang around when other people
[SPEAKER_17]: would buy it so I could taste it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: But, uh, yeah, that, and there was,
there was other ones that was right about
[SPEAKER_17]: when we started seeing Indica and
everybody was really impressed.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, it tastes like black hash and it was a
real narcotic high, but, uh, all I could
[SPEAKER_17]: really afford was the Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now there were good Mexicans, but most of
them were, I don't know why they imported
[SPEAKER_17]: it really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a transition period, you know,
while markets were shaking out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but you know, that Colombo that we
used to get imported, hell man,
[SPEAKER_03]: half of that stuff was seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was thinking about what we used to do
with that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people would just throw handfuls
of that fresh Colombian seed out in their
[SPEAKER_03]: yard and just have big.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it seemed like half the weight
they got imported was seed and how tragic
[SPEAKER_03]: it was that we just, you know,
that's interesting what you just said
[SPEAKER_03]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, you were talking about how
uplifting and clear the awoken was and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and, you know, the way you said it,
that, you know, you know, the Colombian
[SPEAKER_03]: just wasn't like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, you know, people don't realize
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, uh, it was, uh, you know,
it was groggy was the way it felt a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a good word for it?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: But some of the real high quality,
the golds were spiritual, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: And some of the red bud was really,
really good, but dirty, a little dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if, and if all you ever smoked was
the, was the low end stuff, you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: recognize, you know, if it, that it had
some of that same stuff that the high end
[SPEAKER_03]: had in it, but it was just kind of buried
under a layer of just, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: bad handling and, and, you know,
yeah, yeah, it was, yeah, it was just
[SPEAKER_03]: crap, you know, but it had, it was still
there, but you had, it's to even recognize
[SPEAKER_03]: that you had to have had the good stuff at
some point say, oh, that's, oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's in there, you know, anyway,
sorry, I'm sidetracking.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, that's, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember, uh, uh, right when,
uh, I can't, this is 1980.
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, I joined the military in 80
eventually, but before that I,
[SPEAKER_17]: I went, I went back to Texas and I,
I, my bro, my cousin had this friend named
[SPEAKER_17]: Jay that was kind of a jock, kind of a
sports guy.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he needed somebody to ride with him
from Dallas to, uh, Houston to pick up
[SPEAKER_17]: some, uh, Panama red.
[SPEAKER_17]: He said it was supposed to be real Panama
red.
[SPEAKER_17]: And of course I jumped on it, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanted to ride with him and,
and we shot right down to Baytown.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I remember he went into this real,
uh, real rough barn and tugboat and it was
[SPEAKER_17]: like a biker bar, man, and people getting
shot in there and everything.
[SPEAKER_17]: But he bought the pound and we cruised on
back to Dallas.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, like I said, I don't know if it
was really Panama red.
[SPEAKER_17]: It seemed to me like it was just real good
Colombian red, but he was selling it back
[SPEAKER_17]: then that he was selling that for a
hundred, uh, an ounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it seems like the red,
maybe the red was all biker controlled or
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, I got more stories.
[SPEAKER_17]: My, my older brother was a wholesale
dealer in 78 and, uh, he was bringing in
[SPEAKER_17]: truckloads of the Mexican shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: We, you know, the brick stuff,
but he also had a private stash.
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is where I first saw California
since Amelia.
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, and I saw a really good goal,
really good Colombians.
[SPEAKER_17]: This was the top of the line that he could
get.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, I remember one time I asked him,
I said, man, which is, what is this since
[SPEAKER_17]: Amelia?
[SPEAKER_17]: What is this stuff?
[SPEAKER_17]: And he said, it's, it's primo.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he said, but this is better.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he had some Columbia red, but in this
stuff would make you feel, I can't
[SPEAKER_17]: describe it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It just made, fixed you, healed your body,
healed your mind.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was really clean, really clean,
uh, you know, secondary and everything.
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, I also found out about cocaine
from him too.
[SPEAKER_17]: That was also really clean, really pure.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, he didn't know about it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I, one morning I got up for school and I
opened up the refrigerator and all these
[SPEAKER_17]: little envelopes fall onto the floor.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I thought, what is this man?
[SPEAKER_17]: And I poured one out.
[SPEAKER_17]: We had a big glass kitchen table and I
poured it on the table.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I said, what is this next thing?
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I go to school and my friend,
this girl that I wasn't romantic with,
[SPEAKER_17]: but I guess she thought that she saw that.
[SPEAKER_17]: And she said, we're not going to school
today.
[SPEAKER_17]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_17]: We sniffed it all day, but that was a,
she knew what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_17]: My brother got busted.
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, therefore, uh, not for, he didn't have
any drugs, but the guy that he was running
[SPEAKER_17]: around with, uh, knew an undercover cop
and they were going to rob him.
[SPEAKER_17]: My brother didn't know it.
[SPEAKER_17]: My brother thought he was going to really
make a sale.
[SPEAKER_17]: And when they went to meet the cops.
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, the, the friend of my brother pulled
out a pistol and killed him.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the woods were all wired with police.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, I didn't see my brother for about
five years after that, except for my
[SPEAKER_17]: brother, who was, he, he was like a rock
star.
[SPEAKER_17]: He thought he was like a rock star.
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, he, he would say, try this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is 82, 82 as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, see, I was in Europe right when,
uh, the last of the great uh, import hash,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, the Afghanis, the package,
uh, Lebanese, we used to get red Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_17]: That was like gum, like big red gum.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was soft and you could bend it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was just, we called it choking red.
[SPEAKER_17]: It would light your lungs up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they, there was rumors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was mixed with gum Arabic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would light your lungs up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: That Lebanese.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could, well, but it could also get hard
as a rock too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you got it soft and you were
getting good stuff, everything we got of
[SPEAKER_03]: that Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was pretty much all that was
around where we were.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was hard as a rock and it barely got
you high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it might've had CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean the black.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like golden red.
[SPEAKER_09]: My experience is that, um, or from
everything I've been able to gather,
[SPEAKER_09]: is that like Europe got the far better
hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: Canada got some, sometimes some relatively
decent hash and the United States and the
[SPEAKER_09]: United States got the, got the shit that
stuck to your shoe.
[SPEAKER_09]: They got the C grade and the D grade,
everything that they couldn't sell in
[SPEAKER_09]: Canada and Europe.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were like, we'll send to America
because they'll take anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so maybe you could talk about that for
a second.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you were in, when you were in Europe,
when you were stationed in Europe,
[SPEAKER_09]: you got to experience a bunch of,
of hashish.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, I was stationed in a infantry
battalion in bomb holder wet.
[SPEAKER_17]: That was West Germany then.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, I mean, we were always out in the
field.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was in the infantry, so we were always
camping out and all this shit,
[SPEAKER_17]: but, uh, we would get, uh, what they'd
call a plate.
[SPEAKER_17]: A plate was about $200 and it was a
hundred grams.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, or we get, we get a piece and a piece
would be $20, but it could be one gram or
[SPEAKER_17]: three grams.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, this was all in the barracks.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, this is all with our service
guys, no Germans or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: No urine tests for cannabis back then,
right?
[SPEAKER_17]: Pardon me?
[SPEAKER_03]: No urine tests for cannabis back then.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, but that's when they started.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's when, you know, I, I found out
then that the military frowned on this
[SPEAKER_17]: behavior.
[SPEAKER_04]: Had you told me, was that not right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, did I do something wrong?
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was like, cause nobody's seen weed
there.
[SPEAKER_17]: None of the Germans, nobody had weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: We were selling it for $25 a joint.
[SPEAKER_17]: This guy was selling joints for $25 and I
was buying a hundred dollars, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it was excellent.
[SPEAKER_17]: I go into some of the, the, uh,
Gost Hoff's, you know, where they had the
[SPEAKER_17]: bar and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just light one up because the smell
was so different.
[SPEAKER_17]: It didn't smell like hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: Then we'd smoke it publicly.
[SPEAKER_17]: What did it smell like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Smell of Colombian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not helpful, Ryder.
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't even know what Matt was saying
the whole time about, I don't know what I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are talking about this mystery
magic and you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can see something I can't see.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to give them something to,
something to bite into, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: What, what did it smell taste?
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, gentlemen, I'm going to tell you
something right now that, that you will
[SPEAKER_17]: experience that taste and you will
experience it pretty soon because I'm,
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm, I've been growing it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know how to cure it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know how to do everything.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now it's legal.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to send you some.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're stopped piling it like a prepper
down there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, one thing, you know, when we had
our little gathering recently,
[SPEAKER_09]: when we had our little gathering recently
or whatever, one of the clear things that
[SPEAKER_09]: comes up is you can get people that have,
that have been in cannabis their whole
[SPEAKER_09]: life.
[SPEAKER_09]: And describing taste and aroma is almost
everyone's weak point.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you're like, what does it taste
like?
[SPEAKER_09]: What does it smell like?
[SPEAKER_09]: And to you, you could be like,
Oh, this reminds me of 1978 or this smells
[SPEAKER_09]: clearly like what I remember.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you try to piece together what that
smell is, the language is insufficient.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a special language for that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's, um, and some of it is
just experiential, you know, like when you
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about baby poo, I think you were
saying the other day, not so about the
[SPEAKER_03]: smell of baby poo.
[SPEAKER_03]: People think that this is some,
you know, some other way to say skunk or
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're imagining something that they
see on a toilet paper after they do their
[SPEAKER_03]: business.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not it, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a whole, it's a, if you've never had
a kid or been around little babies,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you don't, you, you'll never
smell that smell anywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is no frame of reference to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had three kids in four years.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the smell of young kid baby poo is,
is a pretty, pretty, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: that was, that was daily life for quite
some time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it triggers, and it triggers
emotional, you know, memory response to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the smell it's all connected to
the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm a daddy, you know, but,
um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, red, we can do better than
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so you're talking about gold
sandalwood is, is, uh, is, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: one of those woody smells.
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_17]: The, the, the really blonde gold to me
have a, a sandalwood incense burnt almost
[SPEAKER_17]: caramel, almost sweet, but not sweet.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, it was really, it was really
good.
[SPEAKER_17]: It had a different flavor on the exhale
that was, that was kind of addictive.
[SPEAKER_17]: I, you'd want to taste it again and again.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the, the ones like the purples,
they didn't have a fruity flavor or smell
[SPEAKER_17]: like you'd think looking at it,
but it would have more like a,
[SPEAKER_17]: again, a woody, but not cedar,
more like just a, a wood, wood incense
[SPEAKER_17]: taste.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the reds were very cedar tasting with
a delicious, uh, I can't tell.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like a burnt malt almost for,
you know, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That burnt malt, like a, like a loam.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're cutting in and out again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey, um, so yeah, you got laggy
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I tried to talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Hey, that burnt malt, is that like a
loamy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of a peat.
[SPEAKER_17]: But, but let me tell you, uh, when I was
growing up my, in Texas, my, my uncle was
[SPEAKER_17]: really wealthy.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, I had two cousins and one was a
little bit older than I was.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the other one was my age, but,
uh, my uncle, when we got summer vacation,
[SPEAKER_17]: uh, that was just time we had to go to
work for him.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he owned these big properties,
very close to DFW airport.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was our job to mow them.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't mean with a lawnmower.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, with a four cutter, uh,
tractor.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was extremely hot, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, no shade, nothing.
[SPEAKER_17]: We were out there 12 hours, sun up,
sun down.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, a lot of times they'd go,
when we didn't have something to cut,
[SPEAKER_17]: my, my aunt and uncle would leave early
for work and we'd get up and, uh,
[SPEAKER_17]: one more and go sit out on the front porch
and smoke a cigarette, smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_17]: And one morning I was I just got up and I
went outside and the air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_17]: Have you ever been in, in, in really hot
climate and you're in the air conditioning
[SPEAKER_17]: and you go outside and at first it feels
good, you know, like, ah, I'm getting
[SPEAKER_17]: warm.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I was sitting out there and I had my
Marlboro red and I was smoking it with my
[SPEAKER_17]: cousin, the same age as me.
[SPEAKER_17]: And my older cousin came out and said,
Hey man, roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_17]: He threw me a bag, a little bit of a
baggie.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I opened it up and I said,
what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_17]: It was yellow.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it wasn't green at all.
[SPEAKER_17]: There was no green or brown in it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was yellow.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was real Colombian gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Powder?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it, was it flakes, chips, strings,
chunks, nugs?
[SPEAKER_03]: What would it look like?
[SPEAKER_17]: It didn't look real pretty, but it was
just the color of it and full of seeds,
[SPEAKER_17]: just like the Mexican.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it wasn't real hard compressed.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was like flat buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was busted up, but it had been
pressed.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: It had been pressed and they, I guess he
had broken it up, but, and it was only
[SPEAKER_17]: about a gram and a half.
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't very much.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I told him, I said, I don't think
there's a joint here.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he said, bullshit, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: He said, he sat down and rolled a pin
joint.
[SPEAKER_17]: You guys know that word pin joint.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: Little tiny like in the Cheech and Chong
movie.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a toothpick, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, that's a joint.
[SPEAKER_17]: But he, we sparked that up and let me tell
you, I got a little bit more, some words,
[SPEAKER_17]: more adjectives to describe the taste and
smell, but this had a cardboard,
[SPEAKER_17]: almost like a cardboard Coca-Cola.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it had a hash taste similar to the
Lebanese blonde.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was a really, really different
taste.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I mean, the, the Mexican we got had no
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was like, Hey, it tastes like grass,
really grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: That hashiness is why I keep asking people
if they think that there might be indica
[SPEAKER_03]: in, in Colombian gold, you know,
Santa Marta or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that it was very real that it was
hashy.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was heavy.
[SPEAKER_17]: It had a, it had a more, I'll go into that
later because there's a, something I'd
[SPEAKER_17]: like to talk about how the, these heirloom
Colombians occurred.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I believe that happened about 150
years ago.
[SPEAKER_17]: They, they weren't indigenous,
but anyway, so we, we, I took one hit off
[SPEAKER_17]: of that.
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is where we get the expression
expando because it got in your lungs and
[SPEAKER_17]: man, you couldn't hold it in.
[SPEAKER_17]: You cough it out, cough it out.
[SPEAKER_17]: And next thing I know, I was higher than
you could I have ever been in my life.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I, my eyes, everything were
trashed.
[SPEAKER_17]: And my uncle called and said, we had to go
out and cut this pasture.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I said, man, I, I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm too fucked.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to go work now.
[SPEAKER_17]: My cousin was like, come on, smoke some
more.
[SPEAKER_17]: You'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Power through.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: But the thing is my uncle took us out in
the middle of nowhere with the tractor on
[SPEAKER_17]: the trailer and, and he gave us a cooler
and I thought there'd be, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: Gatorade or something like that,
but it was Coors Coors beer was before
[SPEAKER_03]: cell phones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if anything happened, you were walking
back.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you cut your hand off or something,
we drank, we drank all that beer and got
[SPEAKER_17]: so drunk, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, just absolutely wasted,
but by four o'clock, the sun was,
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it was a terrible hangover.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we smoked the rest of that.
[SPEAKER_17]: We didn't finish that little pin joint.
[SPEAKER_17]: We smoked the other half of it at the end
of the day and trashed me again.
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember my uncle, my uncle gave us a
little 38 caliber revolver in case there
[SPEAKER_17]: was a snake or something, you know,
I remember smoking that joint and I was
[SPEAKER_17]: looking at my other cousin going,
you know how to dance boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: The kids revolver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kingpin from an early age.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: But, but that was when I first had good,
good Colombian.
[SPEAKER_17]: There was other Colombian before that,
that I tried, but it wasn't like this.
[SPEAKER_17]: This was really different.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I believe, I do believe that there's
Indica in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally somebody to agree with me on this
crap that was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the taste shirt, the taste shirt
suggests it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The hash flavor, the hip, the hip.
[SPEAKER_17]: The hip was just boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And look, I said, remember, I simplify
when we're saying Indica, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't want to, you know,
I mean, wide leaf, Indica hat,
[SPEAKER_03]: all these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_17]: So remember when, uh, no, uh, in the,
in the late twenties, there were several
[SPEAKER_17]: pharmaceutical companies that came to La
Guajilla in Santa Marta and the peninsula
[SPEAKER_17]: of La Guajilla.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, one of them was Bayer and what
they brought with them, this is all
[SPEAKER_17]: factual.
[SPEAKER_17]: This all really happened.
[SPEAKER_17]: And they brought with them what was
called, uh, Indian hemp.
[SPEAKER_17]: And this was Indica from Indica India.
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there pictures of several years they
had developed one of the strongest
[SPEAKER_17]: Conevenoid producing plants that had ever
been discovered up till then even better
[SPEAKER_17]: than in, in India.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: But at the same time, that was right when
marijuana was demonized in the United
[SPEAKER_17]: States and all Coneven, cannabis medicine
was pulled.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, they, in the beginning of the
thirties, they, they started.
[SPEAKER_17]: So they all pulled out all these
pharmaceutical companies, but the
[SPEAKER_17]: Campesinos, the Colombians, they kept the
seeds and they kept growing it,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know?
[SPEAKER_17]: And by the late fifties, early sixties,
they had a product that was superior,
[SPEAKER_17]: man.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, this shit would knock you on your
ass.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's when they started exporting.
[SPEAKER_03]: What part of the country was the kind of
the epicenter for this?
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, this, this, from what I understand
was all in on the coast, Santa Marta and
[SPEAKER_17]: La Guajilla, which is a peninsula that
goes out, uh, close to Venezuela.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, when I've thrown this out to people
before they said, you know, Santa Marta is
[SPEAKER_03]: an unlikely place for a big pharma company
to go locate an operation like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, they're big businesses do
things big business way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he just started, said it didn't seem
to click right with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What, what, what do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I believe it's pretty much a fact
and is documented that they were in Santa
[SPEAKER_17]: Marta.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if they actually had,
I don't know if they had the plantations
[SPEAKER_17]: there.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me tell you the Santa Marta,
this, this entire Cordella that goes up,
[SPEAKER_17]: it's the highest coastal range in the
world.
[SPEAKER_17]: It goes from sea level up to 20 something
thousand feet, snow capped mountains.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a million microclimates there and
it's inaccessible.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's still very remote to go there.
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to hike in and everything else.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I can see there and La Guajilla,
you know, that's where they were exporting
[SPEAKER_17]: all the gold.
[SPEAKER_17]: They were, they were actually using
tractors to, to farm the cannabis there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So contrasted with Afghanistan,
you know, or India, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in the climate, I'm just
wondering how, how, how much selection
[SPEAKER_03]: pressure, the difference in the climate
really placed on these foreign strains
[SPEAKER_03]: that they'd brought there, you know,
what, what, what survived, what thrived in
[SPEAKER_03]: the new, new world, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how did that turn out looking 20 years
later?
[SPEAKER_03]: And was it by the hand of man or,
you know, what are these things that was
[SPEAKER_03]: it done in two crosses and then sat in a
freezer?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, cause that happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: From, from my experience of, of growing
here, environments, everything.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, genetics are a good 50%,
but the other 50% is the environment.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've taken a clone, the same clone and
brought it down 500 meters to a different
[SPEAKER_17]: location to very, very close to the
original, but 500 meters down,
[SPEAKER_17]: totally different plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Really different morphology.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it still has, what I, what I did
it with was my, it's a train wreck Panama
[SPEAKER_17]: that I really liked.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I grew a clone in Zipicon and I took
another clone down to Kachupai,
[SPEAKER_17]: which is down in the valley, about 500
meters lower.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the guy grew it for me and we compared
buds and everything.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was different.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was really different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, um, did you get to see the
difference in the, the leaf width?
[SPEAKER_06]: The morphology?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: The, the, no, I really can't say there was
a difference in that, but they were
[SPEAKER_17]: shorter and swatter the higher up it went
and the lower you go down, the more they
[SPEAKER_17]: try to get bigger and bushier.
[SPEAKER_17]: See, I could grow right now at a much
lower elevation and it'd probably be a lot
[SPEAKER_17]: easier, but the pathogens and the insects
are, and I don't want to live there.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to live in the fucking trees.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can understand that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a big part of it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why you went down there and everything.
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_17]: It still is.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm still looking for that perfect,
that just that niche, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: topology is very important.
[SPEAKER_17]: Columbia's like Mexico.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really, really mountainous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there bamboo?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there like big, we could build a giant
bamboo freaking like master command
[SPEAKER_03]: center, kind of jutting out of a hillside,
all, all cantilevered and stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, with big, big support beams.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'd have a view of the whole valley
underneath us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, the sound of, of, you know,
like bongo drums would be playing in the
[SPEAKER_03]: background nonstop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the smoke would walk through the air.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: But occasionally, uh, you'd run into other
kinds tie in particular tie stick.
[SPEAKER_17]: I, I never owned a tie stick, but I smoked
a little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, there was a bunch of good
Mexicans, Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_17]: We used to get real Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_17]: That was pretty good at first,
uh, real seedy Brown, but had a,
[SPEAKER_17]: had a really uplifting clean high.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll put a time, put a timestamp on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know, when, when was it good?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it wasn't good.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's, can you help us with that?
[SPEAKER_17]: It was good around when I first tried it
around 77.
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, it was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was good is better than maybe are equal
to good Colombian.
[SPEAKER_17]: And by 1982, when I returned to the United
States, it was shit, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't, it was all seeds.
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't any good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 82.
[SPEAKER_03]: And later, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And 82 is when I started really seeing
since immediate that Colombian was pretty
[SPEAKER_17]: much gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all since I seem to remember a
story about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Colombians started using Jamaica as a
way point for smoke or somebody in South
[SPEAKER_03]: America started using Jamaica as a
stopover point for smuggling powders into
[SPEAKER_03]: the U S and it, and it really changed the
whole environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, maybe you're supply line of,
of the good stuff from the island was just
[SPEAKER_03]: interrupted and, and then it still existed
there, but you guys just weren't getting
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always a possibility, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, like I said, I had a very limited,
I, I, I didn't know big like mad Jag.
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't know big people like that.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just knew people on the streets,
users, regular guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I picture it anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't spoil it with any of this.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me tell you a quick, quick story about
bamboo and Kachi pie.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we going to do, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where Kachi pie?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's Kachi pie?
[SPEAKER_17]: Kachi pie is lower elevation than Zipicon.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's on the same road.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's on the same.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a Camino Real.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an ancient road, Spanish road.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's out of the, out of the,
below the cloud layer.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is, this is below that cloud layer.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now you're getting down into about 1,500
meters where Zipicon is up around 2000
[SPEAKER_17]: meters and Bogota is 2,700 meters.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's going up.
[SPEAKER_17]: You're going up this giant plateau.
[SPEAKER_06]: How far in, preferably in miles,
cause I don't understand kilometers a bit
[SPEAKER_06]: because I'm a dumb American, but,
but how, how far from Bogota are you when
[SPEAKER_06]: you're talking about Zipicon from like
Bogota miles wide?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, everything's about two hours
distance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's helpful.
[SPEAKER_06]: But two hours, like driving up a mountain
that's crazy roads or.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, maybe one hour of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: The other, we have really good Autobahn
quality roads here, really highways,
[SPEAKER_17]: super highways.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's when you get into the road that goes
from the main highway down to Zipicon that
[SPEAKER_17]: it starts getting to be like a real
twisty.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's, it's, it's safe,
but there's always rock slides and it's
safe.
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just some rock slides.
[SPEAKER_03]: No poison spiders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there, are there like a lot of poison
spiders down there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause Australia is filled with those
things.
[SPEAKER_17]: So now I got bit by some kind of spider
and Zipicon got sick and went to the
[SPEAKER_17]: doctor that gave me some kind of
antihistamine that almost gave me a heart
[SPEAKER_17]: attack, but no, I never see them very much
because I'm up in altitude where I am.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no flies, no spiders.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's clean, beautiful temperate climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you met this guy's got it figured out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the first thing I asked him.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't about the safety.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was how bad are the insects?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm terrified of insects.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can take.
[SPEAKER_06]: Humans I'm okay with.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can deal with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They suck, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an army.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're marching the earth right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we don't even notice it's
happening around us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause their timeline is just completely
different from humans, but pretty soon
[SPEAKER_03]: we're all going to realize, you know,
it's too late.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are edible.
[SPEAKER_17]: They better watch us.
[SPEAKER_17]: But let me tell you this about this
adventure with Ruth.
[SPEAKER_17]: Ruth is my Colombian partner here,
a business partner.
[SPEAKER_17]: And one day we were going to get bamboo
for the plant supports, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: so we could tie the plants up with it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we go to catch you pine.
[SPEAKER_17]: She starts talking to this guy,
random guy on the street.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's like, yeah, man, I know where the
bamboo is, you know?
[SPEAKER_17]: So he hops in.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's in the truck and we start going down
the valley.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he says, keep going, keep going.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're passing this door, passing that
store.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now suddenly we're in the middle of this
giant bamboo grove or it's all bamboo.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he jumps.
[SPEAKER_17]: We were looking for a store to buy it.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I'll chop it down for you,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Handpicked only the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, how big was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just curious what, you know,
well, it's not actually bamboo.
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, it's, it's some other plant that's
similar to bamboo that grows here,
[SPEAKER_17]: but it was about that big in diameter.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a good size tubes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's no joke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_17]: But, uh, it was a fun adventure cause this
guy was like, kept saying we were going,
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wondered where the hell is this guy
taking us, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of, where has he taken us?
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like you've taken us to Columbia
already at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did we get there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just timeline in it, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, uh, I'm going to be chopping
things around.
[SPEAKER_06]: So are they doing, are they doing big
indoor operations down there?
[SPEAKER_06]: And is that affordable?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like kilowatt hour price?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's available.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: They'll, they, the reason cannabis foreign
cannabis companies come here is to exploit
[SPEAKER_17]: the people.
[SPEAKER_17]: Because here the people will work for a
hundred dollars a month and that's a
[SPEAKER_17]: pretty good rate.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the, the electricity is real cheap
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: God, how blind, you know, I mean how big,
big industry rolls into, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the, the hot bed of cannabis in the world,
you know, besides Thailand probably right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they ignore the Nash, the natural
treasure that is, that lives only there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, see it just as another,
as another, uh, resource pit to be steam
[SPEAKER_03]: rolled exploitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like every commodity.
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_17]: But let me tell you what they do.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a big German company, GMW
laboratories right here in Piper.
[SPEAKER_17]: And they have, uh, I don't know if I,
I guess it's about 10 acres of
[SPEAKER_17]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_17]: And what they do is run non cycle active
and it's all on hydro hydroponics in
[SPEAKER_17]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's set up the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, hold on.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're growing hemp with hydro in
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it's non psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's to me it's hemp, but it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like candy down.
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Harlequin and ACDC.
[SPEAKER_17]: Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, uh, all the, the, what's the other
one?
[SPEAKER_17]: The Charlotte's web, all those.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: These are, these are ones I don't want to
work with.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't really even like, I had many
of them and I don't really even want to
[SPEAKER_17]: grow any more of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: No.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: But that, that here's the kicker.
[SPEAKER_17]: When I went there, they're all wanting me
to help them and everything.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm doing the tour.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm wearing this, this HEPA suit or
something, you know, with all this stuff
[SPEAKER_17]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, I really didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And they said, okay, here's where we do
our drying.
[SPEAKER_17]: We put it in the drying oven for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_17]: What the fuck, dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And this young, young Colombian guy comes
out.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's in this scientist outfit.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I said, what are you doing,
man?
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't you even understand?
[SPEAKER_17]: He destroys all those beautiful volatile
terpenes and things.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he had no concept of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he does.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did after he talked to you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, now they've changed and they've gone
to, uh, dry freezing, which I think is a
[SPEAKER_17]: very better change because they're
getting, but it's still non psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's all CBD and it's all sitting in a
warehouse.
[SPEAKER_17]: They haven't sold one gram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like the, the United States.
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming to a gas station near you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when I, when I did that big hemp
reversal and got to go out to the big
[SPEAKER_06]: fields and stuff and see what they did
with the end product, it was literally
[SPEAKER_06]: tossed in fields of dirt with goat heads
in it just piled up, not even in crates,
[SPEAKER_06]: just dirt on the dirt.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they just had people come scoop it up,
turn it into isolate, move it on biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just, mine was mind blown how it was
kept, not even in crates in the dirt,
[SPEAKER_06]: just in the dirt out in the open fields,
just to get everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's gross.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why I have no interest in big,
big operations.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to be involved.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to talk to those people.
[SPEAKER_17]: What I enjoy is growing the best that I
can and teaching the young people I know
[SPEAKER_17]: how to do what I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a completely different craft in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's a totally different,
they're almost unrelated, except that they
[SPEAKER_06]: happen to work with a similar plant.
[SPEAKER_17]: When you come, when you come and see me
and you smoke with me, you'll know the
[SPEAKER_17]: difference.
[SPEAKER_17]: You'll see the light.
[SPEAKER_17]: I can tell you, I can draw you pictures,
send you videos, but do you hit that?
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you hit it with me?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only way to truly tell.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Matt, I've got a question about the
emerging Colombian commercial scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: I assume they're going to start having
dispensaries and stuff pop up and retail.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to become a retail product,
fancy packaging and everything like it
[SPEAKER_03]: does everywhere else to fill our
landfills.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt, you saw it out in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you have some thoughts about the
dispensaries as the kind of taste maker,
[SPEAKER_03]: the opinion shaper in a commercial,
legal, recreational market like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do people just buy what they're pointed to
when they walk into the store?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it all just about looks and nothing
about effect?
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: In California, the way I've always seen it
work, and I've been to a lot of different
[SPEAKER_06]: places and a lot of different cities,
even in Colorado and Oregon, it's a bud
[SPEAKER_06]: tender who has zero experience or
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: In my opinion, I've never met,
it's so rare unless it's like a friend
[SPEAKER_06]: that I've had put into a dispensary that I
know knows their stuff and that's so rare,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I just never really just honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: On occasion met someone that really knew
what they were talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd see, oh, you want a hybrid?
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to be sleepy?
[SPEAKER_06]: Get a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they even going to have anything
though?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would they even have in their- They
wouldn't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if they did, they wouldn't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: A 14, 16 week.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they wouldn't have that.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way because they'd be paying
too much.
[SPEAKER_17]: Nobody grows that here.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does Colombia do it different?
[SPEAKER_03]: What changes could, if you had it to do
over again, Matt, you've seen it up close
[SPEAKER_03]: and personal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can it be done differently too?
[SPEAKER_03]: This seems like a sidetrack, but I think
Red has a vested interest in this stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: and you've got knowledge and experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that I would be the right
person to ask on how to do it different
[SPEAKER_06]: because I'm such a pessimist, but I'm
interested in Red's opinion on how he
[SPEAKER_06]: would do it different than what he said.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, first of all, recreational or
personal use is not legal here,
[SPEAKER_17]: but it is.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can have up to 20 grams.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just not commercialized, not
regulated, but you can have 20 grams of
[SPEAKER_17]: weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can have five grams of hash legally,
but the laws have not changed and what
[SPEAKER_17]: they consider more than 19 plants is micro
trafficking that you're selling it micro.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's going to follow where you
are.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's going to be because they love
California.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're always looking at the laws there.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're always modeling things after up
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is so scary because what I realized
really early on being from the grower
[SPEAKER_06]: side, was that the more corporate it got,
the more legal or quasi-legal it looked
[SPEAKER_06]: for people to be able to smoke while
they're still trying to push through these
[SPEAKER_06]: THC percent max out type things in the
background, but they made it more illegal
[SPEAKER_06]: or more easy to tax the shit out of you if
you grow and took the ability for you to
[SPEAKER_06]: produce your own medicine for free at home
away from you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people like the idea of just being
able to go buy it as an end product more
[SPEAKER_06]: than they like the idea of being able to
grow it because it just seems like a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the end, I think it's a big loss
for everyone to go that route.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, remember too, though, that here it's
a lot different.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, you can flower year round.
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't have to set up lights.
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't have to put a lot of effort into
growing it like that.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't want to offend.
[SPEAKER_17]: I have more respect for Colombians than
Colombians themselves.
[SPEAKER_17]: But the thing about them is they like
fads.
[SPEAKER_17]: They want to do what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_17]: They want to do what's going on in New
York and stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: So a lot of it's you can go now.
[SPEAKER_17]: They have dispensaries where you can go
and you can walk in and buy weed legally.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, not legally, but you know,
you can buy it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can go to any any open market where
they have potatoes and corn and you can
[SPEAKER_17]: buy weed there too.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they get messed with a lot?
[SPEAKER_17]: You just buy the plant and take it home.
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't even break it down.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just jump in the taxi.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've done that many times.
[SPEAKER_17]: The whole plant hanging out the window.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did the does the police or government mess
with people a lot or try to tax them at
[SPEAKER_06]: that point when they see it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or how does that work?
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, mostly they they they get you when
you're moving, you know, like if you go to
[SPEAKER_17]: a bus station or if you go on a taxis,
cars, that's how they get you.
[SPEAKER_17]: But in your house, they I've never had
anybody come in my house.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't want to get myself in trouble,
but I've grown a lot more than 20 plants
[SPEAKER_17]: in my house.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I mean, I've had police come in and
say, wow, you have some beautiful plants,
[SPEAKER_17]: man.
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, I hope it changes.
[SPEAKER_17]: And right now, I don't know if you know
it, but if you look at the news,
[SPEAKER_17]: they're having these big cannabis marches
because they want the new president to
[SPEAKER_17]: sign into law the what they call adult
news.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's just regulated.
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're pushing him because they want
they want it to be here like it is
[SPEAKER_17]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're working real hard together right
now to actually find another thing in the
[SPEAKER_17]: microclimate that I deem as perfect and
getting it all set up.
[SPEAKER_17]: The thing is, it's so much with the
regulations and all this money she's
[SPEAKER_17]: having to spend to be able to get the
licensing.
[SPEAKER_17]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we've been working five years,
five years.
[SPEAKER_17]: Five years on this project.
[SPEAKER_17]: And wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's coming together, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm telling you, I've I've got the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_17]: All I got to do is find the right place
and boom, I'm there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Seeds now.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, if if if you've got a place,
a licensed place that can receive them,
[SPEAKER_17]: I can send you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, I don't have any Colombian
seeds right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: But what I work, my work at the Finca is
licensed to sell.
Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, probably got to get you and
Matt down here to help me feminize them.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I can I can teach.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very easy to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you hear a groaning sound, it's it's
the Internet of people all trying to reach
[SPEAKER_03]: red in Colombia right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know seeds are trying to find a web
address.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the tubes are being clogged with all
the demand flooding through.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I'm not trying to sell seeds,
really.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not trying to sell anything.
[SPEAKER_17]: I I'm just saying that we are now able to
to do that legally.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, you may want to clarify what
would be involved with doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, it's not, you know,
the any 16 year old, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: can take a can go to his car from high
school and order seeds with his cell phone
[SPEAKER_03]: from your website and have it,
you know, with his mom's credit card.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this isn't how it would work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're licensed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The receiving party would also have to be
licensed as a as a hemp facility in the
[SPEAKER_03]: United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and the certificate of all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's it's tragic.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we have all that.
[SPEAKER_17]: We have all that.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's got to be below point zero three
to import into the United States now.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, is this OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say, is this the stuff
that gives you the erection?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it doesn't say that on the label,
but first encounter what you would
[SPEAKER_06]: classify or call either creepy,
creepy.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you pronounce it?
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_17]: Creepy, creepy.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, like with a in Spanish, why is
spelled with an I creepy?
OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how was it actually spelled down there?
[SPEAKER_17]: C R I P P I.
[SPEAKER_17]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when did you first encounter the
creepy?
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, what happened?
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a pretty interesting story.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was a teacher and a high school in
Bogota.
[SPEAKER_17]: This was 2012, right at the beginning of
2012.
[SPEAKER_17]: I when I came back in 2011, I bought a
pound of the same good brown Colombian.
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, twenty dollars for the pound.
[SPEAKER_17]: But when I started teaching at the school,
my contact, I still have this guy,
[SPEAKER_17]: too.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've known this guy since 2004 or hey,
get me anything, any kind of drug I want.
[SPEAKER_17]: Good friend.
[SPEAKER_17]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_17]: Good friend.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: For real.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's a good guy, though.
[SPEAKER_17]: Really nice, mellow guy.
[SPEAKER_17]: I love this guy.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: But but I called him up, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: I said, man, can you bring me LB?
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you bring me a pound?
[SPEAKER_17]: And he said, hey, I got something better,
but you can't buy a pound of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have a pound of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought, oh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_17]: Gold or what?
[SPEAKER_17]: Man, yes, he got those before.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I met him on the street because my
wife, even after all these years,
[SPEAKER_17]: wouldn't let him come in her house.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I met him on the street.
[SPEAKER_17]: He said, James, it opens up this
newspaper.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like you had it wrapped in newspaper.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was creepy.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was seedless since since Indica.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_17]: And not pressed.
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't like it is now.
[SPEAKER_17]: This was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_17]: White Widow's what he called it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it looked like White Widow.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was quite a bit more expensive.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I went ahead and bought it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was about two thousand gram.
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_17]: Where the other was two thousand a half a
pound or ten thousand a half a pound.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: But anyway, so I bought some and at first
I liked it, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_17]: The next time I got it, he said this is
skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he'd never he's never heard.
[SPEAKER_17]: He doesn't know these names, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_17]: I have photos of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Beautiful, dark green with red hairs going
through it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Real flowery smell.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Up high.
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess was skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.
[SPEAKER_17]: Then I then it changed.
[SPEAKER_17]: Then then it changed.
[SPEAKER_17]: I started getting it from another guy and
it was these big clumps like a big,
[SPEAKER_17]: hard clump of compressed or vacuum bagged.
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, Indica, but yeah, seedless,
completely seedless.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I guess it was like Beasters.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was the creepy.
[SPEAKER_17]: And pretty soon I didn't like it that
much, although I bought it because I
[SPEAKER_17]: wasn't growing at the time.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I did find one seed.
[SPEAKER_17]: I found a seed in it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Normally I never have found seeds.
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you have seeds, you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what year did you first encounter it?
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, when I first saw Creepy, it was the
beginning of 2012.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting, because that's about the time
that I got those seeds sent up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I wonder if this is the same
guy because like it was on Mr. Nice,
[SPEAKER_06]: same era.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the guy, when he sent it to me,
he spelled it Creepy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I don't know, like I'd
never heard of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then later on, I saw another Colombian
spelled C-R-I-P-I.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, oh, my God, maybe the dude
was right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like he wasn't just calling you
creepy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a common nickname for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you kind of came across that way in
some of those posts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, this is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: The males might have been in the seeds,
might have been in the mail before he kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of realized, hey, this guy's kind of
creepy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's some creepy for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, this is possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Creepy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said some creepy things.
[SPEAKER_17]: But Creepy is outdoor grown.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's grown in all over Colombia,
Antioquia, Calca, even even up in near
[SPEAKER_17]: Cartagena.
[SPEAKER_17]: And let me tell you, I don't I'm naturally
a downer.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm against it and don't like it because
number one, I don't smoke a lot of indica.
[SPEAKER_17]: Number two, it's commercial.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it gives me a bad effect, a negative
effect.
[SPEAKER_17]: It does me.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: But in Cartagena, when I bought a nice
chunk of it, it was excellent,
[SPEAKER_17]: man.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was it was uplifting.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was really a good but it looked just
like the other indica clump.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it had a stellar.
[SPEAKER_17]: I brought some back with me from Cartagena
two years ago.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I also got some in Santa Marta that
was it wasn't the same as what I had in
[SPEAKER_17]: Cartagena.
[SPEAKER_03]: So real quick, I'm sorry, Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys, it's industrial.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're growing for profit.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are they about chemicals and
pesticides and stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, are you getting a clean product
with this or what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Full of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: No flushing either.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it burns black.
[SPEAKER_17]: So a lot of it burns.
[SPEAKER_17]: But now they're there.
[SPEAKER_17]: It varies.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a bunch of different types of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: But the real shitty stuff burns black and
has a chemi taste.
[SPEAKER_17]: And they all use pesticide chemicals.
[SPEAKER_17]: They have to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: So would you say because I know people are
going to be yelling at me if I don't pin
[SPEAKER_06]: you down on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you say that Crippie is something
like and this is just what I'm hearing you
[SPEAKER_06]: say, but maybe you can tell me if I'm
wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's some sort of commercial, probably
Dutch import type like skunk one or one of
[SPEAKER_06]: those types.
[SPEAKER_06]: And any of them will do.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a non Colombian based Afghani
based type plant grown there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we will do.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Same thing like they did in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, exactly.
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, these aren't half happy growers that
are doing these are people that are hand
[SPEAKER_17]: to mouth.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, they're survival and they don't
even give a fuck about the genetics or
[SPEAKER_17]: anything.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_17]: Trays of clones put them out and it's a
it's cartel weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And people that bring you cocaine make
this shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when do you think from people
you've spoken to, when do you think that
[SPEAKER_06]: term Crippie first started getting used or
applied to weed like that?
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, see, I left Colombia in the summer
of 2007 and went back to Georgia and when
[SPEAKER_17]: I left, there wasn't any creepy.
[SPEAKER_17]: And when I came back, that's when it was
there.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I came back in 2011 and it was there
then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know when it happened.
[SPEAKER_17]: I bet it probably happened 2008,
2009.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's it's some of it's good.
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of it's bad.
[SPEAKER_17]: But when you live in Colombia and you
smoke, you should be growing your own
[SPEAKER_17]: weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, yeah, it sounds like that.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's like going to a prostitute when
you're married to Lonnie Anderson,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honey, that's that's who would have popped
into my head to exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Charo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I I don't know if you want to
get into it now, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: I lived with Kaiki from Canna Biogen here
for three years and also Charlie Garcia.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's his stage name or something.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm hoping we can send out some good
vibes to him because I understand I don't
[SPEAKER_17]: talk to him anymore, but my wife still
does.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_17]: He was really sick.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know what it is, but I hope he's
all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was always super cool to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: He since I started, he's always been super
cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even when a lot of people wouldn't talk to
me, he was one of the first people that
[SPEAKER_06]: had really what I considered a larger seed
company that that would talk to me and
[SPEAKER_06]: that was a serious breeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully he is doing.
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe he was the I believe he was the
first Spanish seed bank.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's very possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were reading a book.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know who Isidoro Rodriguez is?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's someone that started Canna Biogen
with Charlie Garcia.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he wrote books about like the breeding
behind like Sandstorm and Chitral and
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I probably know I probably know him
with a different name.
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably, probably.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, because, you know, that's that's
really my I was I've been talking to him
[SPEAKER_17]: since oh six at least.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, your parents did not name
you Red Ryder.
[SPEAKER_17]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are not real names.
[SPEAKER_17]: He he well, I mean, I don't know like like
you know him as Charlie Garcia and Kaiki,
[SPEAKER_17]: but that's not his name at all.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not his real name.
[SPEAKER_17]: And of course, I won't divulge that.
[SPEAKER_17]: But anyway, he used to send me you might
have heard of Red Snake.
[SPEAKER_17]: The the Oaxacan Punto Rojo cross.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: I got better.
[SPEAKER_17]: But that was excellent.
[SPEAKER_17]: But that never got out publicly.
[SPEAKER_17]: He wouldn't sell that or Mestiza,
which which is another one I really like.
[SPEAKER_17]: Mestiza.
[SPEAKER_17]: Which one was that?
[SPEAKER_17]: Mestiza is Oaxacan and Mishima Khan.
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, Mishima Khan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, how do you spell that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think you're saying Mestiza with
a T.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
Okay.
Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I saw that for sale for I saw that
for sale for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was on the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the Mestiza was there was a
Mexamalia, too, from another company.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a Oaxacan Burmese thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't mean that what you've got is
the same thing as what went on the market,
[SPEAKER_03]: though.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because a lot of the stuff like
would be like, whatever he were crossed to
[SPEAKER_06]: like a Malawi.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like to put it into seed market form.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, his personal collection would
likely be the, you know, the.
[SPEAKER_03]: God, can you imagine?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you read that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Tuscante.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The old Tuscante.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, five.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What else?
[SPEAKER_06]: What else?
[SPEAKER_06]: What else you got?
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to show you my drawer,
man.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I've got all.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got that motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt's like the dog's got the scent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he's going to track that thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, but we did a lot.
[SPEAKER_17]: He brought a lot of stuff with him that we
never got to really finish.
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's a bunch of mongo biche that we were
working with.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I can read that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I tell you, Ruth, my partner has
gotten spent so much time with the health
[SPEAKER_17]: department, the agriculture department,
the justice ministry, that she's really
[SPEAKER_17]: well connected with them and she knows
exactly what's legal and exactly what's
[SPEAKER_17]: not.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I put a lot of faith in everything she
says.
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, I do what I want to do,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're different.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a different part of the operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it seems to me that if
anybody is going to be successful in the
[SPEAKER_03]: legal cannabis world, you've got to have
somebody in the organization that's
[SPEAKER_03]: focused on that interface with the
regulators, with government and who
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't, you know, who can actually do
that kind of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And be successful with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, some people can can do
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other people hate that kind of work and
avoid it at all costs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not pointing any fingers here,
but I think there may be three people here
[SPEAKER_03]: who probably feel that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's great that you got that partner,
you know, you complementary skills teaming
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the visionary.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you see it, you know how to
do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's she's handling the part that you're
not good at and you're doing the part.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I want to really give a good
recommendation to her because she she
[SPEAKER_17]: listens to me and and and not just listens
to me, but understands.
[SPEAKER_17]: And a lot of people hear you, but they
don't understand you.
[SPEAKER_17]: She understands me and understands what I
want to do and believes in it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that we feed off each other like that
or I feel like that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it's like consciousness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Constant roadblocks and interruptions to
your to your, you know, your dreams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those things are can can be
demotivating and depressing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people quit right before they
get to the finish line.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have partnerships or marriages to
like they really are like marriages are
[SPEAKER_06]: very important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Communication is important.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you're in a serious business
relationship with someone, it's like a
[SPEAKER_06]: marriage that you can't just leave because
there's responsibilities, there's all
[SPEAKER_06]: kinds of commitments that you have to each
other, whether financial or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's yeah, it's you have to take it
serious like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when one of the partners is just a
complete prick, it's it's almost
[SPEAKER_06]: unlivable, unmanageable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when someone can actually hear you and
you can communicate with them,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's that's usually someone you stick
with for as long as you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying my best, Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't appreciate you bringing out
our dirty laundry here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm really trying.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's mostly what I work with is kind of
biology and ace.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: Very, very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you are you still close with Duby?
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, not close at all.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think the world of him, he's my my
best friend, if he ever wanted to be.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I love their work.
[SPEAKER_17]: He sent me a bunch of seeds one time.
[SPEAKER_17]: And man, I've been growing those ever
since he sent them about four years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your favorite from there?
[SPEAKER_06]: They're they're stock.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Malawi, Malawi, the ace Malawi.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you ever if you ever come see me or you
we get together, you'll you'll try it down
[SPEAKER_17]: here.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's when I want to think when I want to
be inspired, motivated.
[SPEAKER_17]: I smoke that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you done it?
[SPEAKER_06]: And have you made any cobs down there from
it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, and I also make the you know,
I learned this from ISE.
[SPEAKER_17]: Mag, but I also make make it with the
Colombians and it brings back that must be
[SPEAKER_17]: earthy.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the only place you find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we were talking about that smell the
other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned Pete and Loam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, so far.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Down in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the color changes and it's looks just
like the old stuff, but no seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you ever wonder how they did it in
bulk?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, how that stuff just
happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you if you're just shit
stacking it like if you're just shit
[SPEAKER_06]: stacking it, it's going to happen
naturally, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like some of the inside is going to
naturally ferment on the inside.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't intentional.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm writing that down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit stacking.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very scientific just happen.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's sun drying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's stacking sun drying.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's some sort of Harry Potter
incantation that's made of magic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: A little fairy dust on there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's it's it's.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, one thing I was like, I like to know.
[SPEAKER_17]: You remember when I was telling you that
first summer of 76, when I first got high
[SPEAKER_17]: with Becky, my mother had a prescription
for quite loose.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you know, I am so jealous every time I
hear people talk about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am too young to have ever smelled,
seen, tasted, experienced quail eggs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please tell me.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: I wrote in a pay dryer and the guy said,
get in the dryer in a laundromat.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got in the dryer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to figure out what the hell
he was talking about for a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got no what?
[SPEAKER_03]: What one is they kind of made your body
into rubber.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was pretty common for people
to take these things wreck their car,
[SPEAKER_03]: bounce out of it completely unscratched.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was really common.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is that you got in the dryer and took a
tumble and you probably bounced out
[SPEAKER_03]: feeling better than ever.
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember getting sick.
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember falling into a garbage can,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's another story I got to tell you
about, Mike.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think I even put this one in my
vintage Colombian, but there was a dealer
[SPEAKER_17]: named Mike and this guy would get all
kinds of drugs and different kinds of
[SPEAKER_17]: Lombo, Mexican, even Thai.
[SPEAKER_17]: But he gave us the seven fourteens.
[SPEAKER_17]: We were we were waiting for him to come.
[SPEAKER_17]: The guy to come with the weed and said,
hey, let's try one of these.
[SPEAKER_17]: Roar Roar seven fourteen.
[SPEAKER_17]: What the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_17]: Good deal.
[SPEAKER_17]: One hour later, I'm riding in a pay dryer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you know, you're the same age as
I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was as far as timeline, you know,
those things were just about to disappear
[SPEAKER_03]: when I was around a senior in high school.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So probably the same for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a thing that happened right
around that end of the era where all these
[SPEAKER_03]: bootlegs started showing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were mostly like Diaz,
like like what is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Valium.
[SPEAKER_03]: Valium.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: People would mix it with alcohol and just
get knocked slam out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just blacked out instantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever get a bootleg red or so?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your mom's.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, in the beginning, it was roar.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I believe those have been
pharmaceutical and then it changed to
[SPEAKER_17]: lemon.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both both of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of them were pharmaceutical,
but they were both copied also.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen I've seen like old shirts with
lemon on them with like a number next to
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven fourteen.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was seven fourteen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first one.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you spell roar?
[SPEAKER_16]: R.O.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an H in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_17]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we got and then we got the
mandrakes from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, what was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's that's got aspirin mixed
with it or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_17]: Some kind of an it came in little packs
like this, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is aspirin.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched a special.
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched a special on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only place in the world you can still
get it is South Africa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to say that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was a good one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hamilton Morris.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's he's someone's grandkid or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't he, Morris?
[SPEAKER_06]: We all are kind of accepting.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but like a really rich benefit.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all really are.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's to come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that head, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That only came out of one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's shaped by the tube.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a special shape, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would call it model shape.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I've got a nice harvest coming up
probably in late April, May.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's my I cross the Malawi with a old
haze that I got from Cannibal Jim.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think it's available, but no.
[SPEAKER_17]: Then I cross that to my beautiful Santa
Marta and they're growing outside right
[SPEAKER_17]: about a block from here.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I only got two beautiful females,
but that that should be a good harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if Matt is that look on his
face.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish you could see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got the same look, Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what's that sound look?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then.
[SPEAKER_03]: But but you're probably wondering,
is that old timers haze or is that Tom
[SPEAKER_03]: Hill haze?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Charlie had both.
[SPEAKER_06]: I sent you a picture, another accession.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that and it looked like,
you know, some of the very extreme phenos
[SPEAKER_03]: when you try and grow stuff like that
indoors, they have a very similar
[SPEAKER_03]: structure, but not, you know, just look so
healthy and robust.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yours just look beautiful grown outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's the structure indoors is really
similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I know guys with phenos like
just like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mango B.J.
[SPEAKER_06]: First time you have seen or heard of Mango
B.J.
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, of course, here they pronounce it
Mongo B.J.
[SPEAKER_17]: But but they Mongo B.J.
[SPEAKER_17]: means unripe mango.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what Mongo B.J.
[SPEAKER_17]: means.
[SPEAKER_17]: They sell it on the street corners.
[SPEAKER_17]: But some people call it lemon,
lemon, lemon, lime or something,
[SPEAKER_17]: I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Limo and something.
[SPEAKER_17]: Not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, I really don't like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think it is?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it normally the same thing or is it
like stuff that's presented as Mango B.J.
[SPEAKER_06]: that's or Mongo B.J.
[SPEAKER_06]: that's not the same?
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm telling you what it is.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very intersect.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's long flowering, low potency.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's unmanageable.
[SPEAKER_17]: It grows in this damn tree.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, that's the ones I've had.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of them may be better.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's a laundry list of
undesirable traits you just threw out
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that pretty much waves off the
entire world from wanting to pop that
[SPEAKER_08]: pack.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just drop to the bottom of the list.
[SPEAKER_17]: Mango B.J.
[SPEAKER_17]: is just like Punta Rojo.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a generalized name.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's many varieties within that name.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I didn't grow a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember, I got this guy at the National
University in Bogota, this guy that I
[SPEAKER_17]: smoke him with.
[SPEAKER_17]: I said, dude, I got these Mango B.J.
[SPEAKER_17]: You got to grow them out.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're excellent.
[SPEAKER_17]: I grew them out.
[SPEAKER_17]: They were all fucking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so these weren't these weren't
Kaikei's Mango B.J.?
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've never grown those.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, because I mean, you know, look,
I mean, we may as well consider these
[SPEAKER_03]: things to be two completely different
things that, you know, the stuff grew and
[SPEAKER_03]: the stuff that the rest of the world may
have access to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, you know, everything that was
wrong with that Mango B.J.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that was that Mango B.J.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should we should assume that the Canna
Biogen ace people would have done their
[SPEAKER_03]: done their job and created a pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Selected for less junkly traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I don't know if he's still has it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't even know if Kaikei is still
selling seeds, but he he had a Punto Rojo.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know where this Punto Rojo came
from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you talk about that?
[SPEAKER_17]: I've grown it and it is good Punto Rojo.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, tell us, Punto Rojo.
[SPEAKER_17]: This Punto Rojo, he came here.
[SPEAKER_17]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember what year it was.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was in the 2000s, but he came here to
Colombia and he hooked up with his
[SPEAKER_17]: buddies, went to Manizales.
[SPEAKER_17]: Manizales is a really unique place and
elevation and climate and everything.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he sourced the Punto Rojo from
Manizales or that area, which is also
[SPEAKER_17]: which is also where the wacky weed,
some of the wacky weed, Manizales Black is
[SPEAKER_17]: from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what wacky weed is?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Manizales Black?
[SPEAKER_17]: That's one of them.
[SPEAKER_17]: The original one, I believe, to have come
from Calca, the candy bar.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that's another story.
[SPEAKER_17]: I got to tell you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_17]: But anyway, getting back to the Punto
Rojo, I've got photos and everything.
[SPEAKER_17]: I grew it in Bogota 2016.
[SPEAKER_17]: But you've got to realize when you're when
you're this this kind of a plant is
[SPEAKER_17]: different than what you've got.
[SPEAKER_17]: You guys, it's not a crucial.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not an OG.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not a this is a it's potent,
but it's it doesn't look like it.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_17]: There's you don't see a lot of crystal.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's not all all trichome.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not a big swirl mass.
[SPEAKER_17]: When you open that bud up, when you open
that flower up and start breaking it up,
[SPEAKER_17]: there's these little like sand size
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_17]: And but it's not that it's the flavor.
[SPEAKER_17]: And of course, the flavor, all these all
these variables are in your environment.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, you get a lot of it from the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_17]: But if you grow it in guano, you get a
different taste.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you grow it in chemical stuff,
you get a different taste.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it is the real deal.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I like it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just don't I am not growing it right
now.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I definitely going to grow it again
because and I have a bunch of the good
[SPEAKER_17]: seeds from from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I was going to ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: Red is, you know, khaki, you know,
by Jan Ace released multiple versions,
[SPEAKER_03]: iterations of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe some of them out crossed with
other other red South American,
[SPEAKER_03]: Central American initiatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just kind of wondering if you have
any more detail where this might fall on
[SPEAKER_03]: that timeline of of stuff that was
actually released by CBG or Ace.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I believe the Punta Rojo seeds that
I have and I grew here are the ones that
[SPEAKER_17]: in fact, I know they are because I helped
him package the the little what he sells
[SPEAKER_17]: them in.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so it's the original I have is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it a was it a repro?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what you what you've got there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they repro seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it, you know, it's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure because he had many things
sent from Spain.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Many, many seeds and things were even had
cuts from Spain.
[SPEAKER_17]: He brought cuts from there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I believe I believe these have been
worked.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't believe they're the directly from
the bag that he got the seeds from in
[SPEAKER_17]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think they've they've because there was
no merchandise.
[SPEAKER_17]: I grew like 12 of them.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, there was true.
[SPEAKER_17]: There was three true males and I don't
know, seven females and they were
[SPEAKER_17]: excellent, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll show you the photos.
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_17]: Big tall colas, single stack colas has
this kind of I don't know.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's it's like cedar, but it's like a wood
smell.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not exactly cedar.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's more like a not pine either.
[SPEAKER_17]: You'd have to smell it, but it's a woody
type dark wood smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like exactly what we'd expect
from something named Punta Rojo,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, it's excellent.
[SPEAKER_17]: And of course, you know that it just means
red tip, red point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?
The.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, another there's there's one you know
about in the United States like that Choco
[SPEAKER_17]: Chiba.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, Choco is a department is a department
on the Pacific coast, and it's it's not
[SPEAKER_17]: suitable for growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very humid.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very jungly.
[SPEAKER_17]: So maybe there was people that said that,
but I've never, ever heard of cannabis
[SPEAKER_17]: being have been produced there.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it may be.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it may very well be, but I've
never heard it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the the first time I saw that
referenced was in an old article.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say it was R, but I might be
wrong, but it was an old article on
[SPEAKER_06]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's talking about the very first
Colombians and where they were being
[SPEAKER_06]: pushed out of.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was I want to say he didn't say
Choco Chiba.
[SPEAKER_06]: He just called it Chiba, Colombian at the
time.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I heard that word before here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He just said Chiba, Colombian.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I didn't know if Chiba was a province
or town or.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, no, that's just a reference for
something that's good, like like what's
[SPEAKER_17]: the other one?
[SPEAKER_17]: That's primo Chimba Chimba.
[SPEAKER_17]: Whenever like something's cool,
they'll say, OK, Chimba.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, it's not Chiba Chiba.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've heard in reference to cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, so that doesn't even help pin
down where the province could have been in
[SPEAKER_06]: relation to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now I remember, I think I remember the
article you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of those things where R was
just kind of just rattling off this,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, this string of, you know,
the 84, you know, where the 78 Santa Marta
[SPEAKER_03]: was really good, but they had a storm
blowing in and the Reds were like a
[SPEAKER_03]: burgundy, blah, blah, blah from Chiba.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like name drop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_06]: This just came in the mail.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a it's a prototype.
[SPEAKER_06]: For this banana OG, but like this guy had
it made in Japan.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a vinyl toy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that cool?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to make some toys with me,
but yeah, because because he's bored with
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's bored with the rubber ducks that have
that have filled the ocean.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wants to replace it with little.
[SPEAKER_06]: It feels like a rubber duck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you get it makes air out of it like a
rubber duck?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, close to air in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to put him up next to the pole spike
girl right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I don't actually want the first
cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hash fruit was what was that?
[SPEAKER_17]: Hash was one.
[SPEAKER_17]: Bubba Bubba.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I buy a gin too?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really, really cush plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So is that a part of peyote purple?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I believe it's a derivative.
[SPEAKER_17]: I also grow.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a very weird plant.
[SPEAKER_17]: The purpose and nothing's like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's freaky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we like that.
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, again, I find that about
Indica's or most Indica's is how it
[SPEAKER_03]: was like it was like I was connected with
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of a sudden, I just started
questioning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything I'd ever been told.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, by the time by the time I got
high that very first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it started to hit me.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got high.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
Yeah.
