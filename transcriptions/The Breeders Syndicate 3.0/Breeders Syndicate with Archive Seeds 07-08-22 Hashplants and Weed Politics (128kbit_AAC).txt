[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: How's everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting this shit set up, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why isn't it letting me view Natsu's
request?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on here?
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Cathy, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get this rocking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, normally the people counter up there
is like all lit up, but it's dimmed on my
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, same with mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ever seen it look like that before?
[SPEAKER_03]: Me neither.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Either way, it was something different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if you want to wait to get
started.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only 80.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there are people popping in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: 702.
[SPEAKER_03]: Normally we bullshit for a minute,
I suppose, before people actually hop on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got any new news?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything good you can share with the
public?
[SPEAKER_03]: Share with the public?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not quite yet, but not quite yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, I am going on a, we'll have to
actually see about next week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I'm going on that adventure to,
I'm going to try to find some long lost
[SPEAKER_03]: cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going on the adventure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going on the adventure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think next week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our buddies is going to be super
happy about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might even be able to get lunch with
them or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you get it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it works out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are going to chat today about a
pretty wide topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people have been asking a lot about
it, which is sort of like the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole like hash plant topic,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's met different things at
different times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of old famous hash
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of breeding that got
bred into those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's a lot of new modern ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew modern plants for hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not only, not only by modern,
I mean, like even like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there was a whole new, new round of named
cuts that, that got, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: hash plant labels or different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now hash plant actually means,
you know, something totally different,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we're going to kind of talk
widely about hash plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you ever have any hash plant
questions or anything along those lines,
[SPEAKER_03]: today's a great day to shoot them and see
what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got all the, I got all the catalogs
ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got, illustrations ready of said hash
plants, most of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I even went back and because there was
one hash plan I thought of that nobody
[SPEAKER_02]: ever really mentions anymore, but for a
while in the, like the 08, 09 era,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was pretty popular and that was the
cuttlefish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I even dug up info on the old
cuttlefish hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we're going to go over as many as
we can remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: As many as we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we're going to talk about the
history of hash plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about a bunch of
specific cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: People can ask away about specific cuts
they're interested in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, like Matt just said, he's got a
list.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like maybe the term hash plant,
you know, just to start, right,
[SPEAKER_03]: is kind of a weird term because all
Afghans back then pretty much bred and
[SPEAKER_03]: grown for hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then some strains got called hash
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some strains got called other names.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do we know that was Neville the first
one to name a strain or did it come over
[SPEAKER_02]: that way with that name?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he used the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know, you know,
the only thing that we know about like the
[SPEAKER_03]: G13 and the PNW hash plant is that Neville
says he bought them in Oregon through
[SPEAKER_03]: friends of Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jorge confirmed that, you know,
but we don't know the origin stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I assume.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just called it what he got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I assume so, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where where the name evolved.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be nice to ask Jorge,
but I don't know if he would know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's weird because it's like
essentially like hash plants started off
[SPEAKER_03]: as basically being any any Afghan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they were all that's what that's
what, you know, marijuana was grown for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was to make hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so people started bringing over all
these Afghans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or hash plants or whatever, all these
various different things over to America.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we talked about this a
bunch, but crossing them with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: different sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is is kind of that's kind of that's kind
of the beginning of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's this is I get probably jump the
gun on showing this one is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, that's not it's not terribly
jumping the gun.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happened is, is that a bunch of
people started bringing over these Afghans
[SPEAKER_03]: because they wanted to add bigger,
chunkier buds to their sativas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they wanted their sativas to finish
earlier.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Afghanistan is a super different
climate than over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of these hash plants or Afghans
that they brought over, they just rotted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just they just read in terrible rot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the vast majority of the seeds that
people brought over ended up being not
[SPEAKER_03]: that useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people would go and get their sativa
seeds from before they bred that indica
[SPEAKER_03]: into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're so early on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Early on, the big hunt for hash plants or
the big hunt for Afghans was ones that
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't rot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of why I think some of
these cuttings became so popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, because most, you know,
most of the breeding that got done just
[SPEAKER_03]: got done with specific moms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because once you found one that did that,
you traded it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how they did over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how they did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so there's an aspect where it's like
Neville when, you know, Neville even said
[SPEAKER_03]: that, like, because Matt held up his
catalog or whatever, all that hunting that
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville did in Afghanistan, he said,
regrettably, like those those Afghans
[SPEAKER_03]: weren't as nice as some of the clone onlys
he got sent over from America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether that was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big Bud or the Pacific Northwest hash
plant or the G 13 or, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the cuttings that he got.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these cuttings that did well,
you know, the NL five, all these different
[SPEAKER_03]: things start getting passed around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Neville probably would met with
matches held up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville probably made it really famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a hash plant pure by he crossed
the hash plant to like the G 13 and the
[SPEAKER_03]: and the NL one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he and then he took a G 13 NL one and
he back crossed it to the hash plant
[SPEAKER_03]: again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what Matt was showing that ugly
squat thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hash plant pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the hash plant here, which I mean,
you know, there is debate on whether the
[SPEAKER_02]: PNW hash plant that exists today is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But looking at this and granted,
you know, different growing environments,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else, I would be hard pressed
to say this looks anything like the cut
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors grown here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the PNW.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't know it looks like it sure does
look puckish.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say it looks like the the hash
plant cut that gets passed around either.
[SPEAKER_03]: But boy, does it look like some ugly puck.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sure does.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bud formation and all that type of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what's weird, maybe I should say
this before we move on.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's weird about what we did right is
someone just asked.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Afghan is hash plant now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Afghan people grew Afghans to make
into hashish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they that they made hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: They still make hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't smoke flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they never called it hash plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was it was just a term that got
put onto Afghans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then people think it made it meant
meant something specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all Afghan and Pakistani stuff,
that's what they did with their plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You make hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and so, you know, and so there's
an aspect where we brought all these
[SPEAKER_03]: plants over to America.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, and started fucking with them,
whether they're Steve Murphy's Afghan that
[SPEAKER_03]: started the NL thing or the, you know,
or the the Pacific Northwest Hash Plan or
[SPEAKER_03]: the Big Bud story or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we weren't using them for hash plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't growing fields like they were
and doing anything that they were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we did, we were looking for them
to blend well with our sativas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, that's a trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that means that right when they
got to America, a completely different set
[SPEAKER_03]: of selection pressures got put into play.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they were they were selecting for
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: They came over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had been selected to work well in the
Afghanistan environment to make to make
[SPEAKER_03]: those people hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we brought it over here and tried to
blend it with our favorite weed to get
[SPEAKER_03]: good weed to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to and to finish early indoors.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, all these different like they
weren't trying to they weren't there was
[SPEAKER_03]: no indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we used Afghans for indoor when
they came over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, they from Afghanistan or Pakistan
or that region, they were always growing
[SPEAKER_03]: outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't blowing up houses in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: They came from a cold, dry environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they weren't worried about the mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying that, like all of the
farmers looking for for, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, genetics, you know, various
aspects that benefit an Afghanistan farmer
[SPEAKER_03]: was much different than a Washington,
Oregon, California, indoor or outdoor
[SPEAKER_03]: grower trying to fuck with some Mexicans
and some Colombians and some Panamanians
[SPEAKER_03]: and some Thai and blend this Afghan into
that and get what they.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a way different set of selection
pressure and we didn't really make hash
[SPEAKER_03]: for a long time, except for for private.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, but we liked they were
short, they were squat, they were they had
[SPEAKER_03]: a bunch of crystal, you know, were visual
creatures, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So frosty looking nugs work better for
Americans, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what were the what were the famous
one of the famous earliest hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the early ones, I mean, as far as the
earliest, we're going to go, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the PNW, there weren't a lot of
early, early hash plants, but some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones early in the scene would be like,
you know, there was the seed bank hash
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, which would be their hash plant
pure, which would be different from,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the G 13 or the hash plant and
one which was using the G 13 hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one we have the puck, of course,
a.k.a.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skelly, we have the cuttlefish hash plant,
B.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was also a champagne hash plant,
which I'm not sure is different from the B
[SPEAKER_02]: .C.
[SPEAKER_02]: hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe some of the Canadian folks will know
we have hash plant 13.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these some of these aren't
even necessarily from the hash plant
[SPEAKER_02]: family of strains that came from Neville.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some of these were just called
hash plant because of whatever reason it
[SPEAKER_03]: became a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hash plant is a bit like Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: In that it's a general term that applies
to a wide variety of things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and why one thing was all
labeled Kush and another thing was labeled
[SPEAKER_03]: hash plant when the Kush was destined to
be made into hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just one of those language things
that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's there is some confusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we can go into individual ones in
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to continue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to jump it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, so that's basically like and
then it became famous because in the 80s
[SPEAKER_03]: as he just showed, Neville started calling
things hash plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was famous hash plant hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and mostly Americans used it
because it was a short squat, decent
[SPEAKER_03]: yielding frosty plant inside.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't you know, nobody was really
making hash in America.
[SPEAKER_03]: We smoked flour mostly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, champagne was different from the B.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's actually interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if you were going to jump around,
but I'm going to really jump around to
[SPEAKER_03]: like today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when when we first brought over all
these hash plants, they were brought over
[SPEAKER_03]: and they had been bred to be excellent
hash plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people like people in Europe and in
the know and you know, Sammy and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: have told me that they feel like a lot of
modern cultivars like a really shitty hash
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That a lot of the traditional ones that
were bred for that specifically and bred
[SPEAKER_03]: for resin are much better plants for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they were never bred for anything
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now with the legalization and all that
and the hash revolution that's happened
[SPEAKER_03]: with all these various elements and dabs
and everything, we're actually like
[SPEAKER_03]: looking people talk about dumpers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They talk about hash yield a lot in
various ways and methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so figuring out what plants are good
hash plants is like back in vogue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of for the first time ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like on on any kind of like commercial
scale, people have been making hash here
[SPEAKER_03]: privately to share with their friends
forever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as like a like a major thing,
it's probably it's pretty recent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last 20 years, probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now with testing and people can be
like, oh, this thing washes six percent or
[SPEAKER_03]: this thing washes this.
[SPEAKER_03]: People start hunting for hash plant
yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is a good washer?
[SPEAKER_03]: What what keeps its flavor?
[SPEAKER_03]: But we went 40 fucking years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without those pressures being applied.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is this is good input from archive.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said dumpers are mainly just plants
with higher than average THC to turf
[SPEAKER_02]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, so there's an aspect where
it's like for a long time, from what most
[SPEAKER_03]: people is hash plants came over here and
got mixed with other weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for breeding purposes,
you know, because like if you look at the
[SPEAKER_03]: puck or you look at that picture,
you know, some of those things were short
[SPEAKER_03]: squat ugly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they weren't the most attractive
things always.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even even Chem 91, you know, aside from
hash plants, Chem 91 is another Afghani
[SPEAKER_02]: not necessarily known for its beautiful
qualities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same kind of way.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same kind of way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So but they started becoming famous
because he put them in the first catalog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there was hash plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, like he was saying,
the Skelly, there's some that survived
[SPEAKER_03]: from back then that became got really well
known.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're not related.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not not a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just someone's asking me to show the hash
plant here again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to show that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the hash plant here, Neville took the
hash plant clone only he got from Oregon
[SPEAKER_03]: and he crossed it to a male NL one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he took a male of that hybrid and
crossed it back to the to the hash plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was his hash plant pure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's honestly kind of like what he
did with a number of things, like when he
[SPEAKER_03]: offered his Hawaiian indica, there's a
number of things where he crossed it once
[SPEAKER_03]: to NL one and then crossed a male of that
hybrid back to itself and just released it
[SPEAKER_03]: as a pure line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was actually a reasonably
common tactic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does appear that Neville got the hash
plant and the G 13 on the same trip at the
[SPEAKER_03]: same time from the same people even.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you have liked to have been able
to grab a pack of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghan mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville sold Neville sold seeds that Jim
Ortega had given him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got so many that he he offered up the
same seeds that he found all of the maple
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he sold for a couple of years as just
50 pack, 50 pack reader packs and 150
[SPEAKER_02]: bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unreal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: In that sense, and that he pretty much
just told you what he was crossing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no real secrecy behind it,
you know, but he was also first.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we didn't have to hide anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that helps.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, you know, the these hash plants,
some of these hash plants have gotten
[SPEAKER_03]: famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very likely that the scout,
the puck is a direct descendant of that
[SPEAKER_03]: picture, Matt, you know, that's the rumor,
at least that it's seeds from then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then our buddy, Bodhi, has a pretty
famous lot number of lines out that him
[SPEAKER_03]: and other people have used.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt got some of those from NDN guy,
the G 13 hash plant, which was 1988.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's that's kind of how they how
they type it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's basically supposed to be from the
first year that Neville released the G 13
[SPEAKER_03]: hash plant hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I who knows what what they were
really from or what year or which seed
[SPEAKER_02]: bank or any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was the story given with them was
this 1988 since he seeds hash plant was or
[SPEAKER_02]: G 13 hash plant, which was what they said.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whatever it is, I mean, it's it that
exists.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of people have that and
people have puck hybrids and some people
[SPEAKER_03]: still have the puck clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and so there's some old hash
plants that exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can kind of like and then there
was kind of like another wave where people
[SPEAKER_03]: started kept using the nickname.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was all grown for flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, nobody was really making
nobody was really using it the way they
[SPEAKER_03]: used it in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not not in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: So but yeah, there was there was something
puck is the hash plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they or they think it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like traditional hash plant and
hash plant strain like in that picture,
[SPEAKER_02]: it does have a lot of similar traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does have a lot of similar traits,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's out there in the community and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: People breed with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, at the very least,
it ties back to something old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's both basically what they were
doing is is in America, we were looking
[SPEAKER_03]: for like hash plants and Afghans that we
could cross to other things and would
[SPEAKER_03]: bring the flowering time and the height
and add some crystal and some density.
[SPEAKER_03]: But but keep but keep a lot of the other
qualities from the sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were sort of the first blends that
people were after was structurally what
[SPEAKER_03]: the hash plant did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the flavors of the sativa and the
high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And but the flavor and the smoke and the
stretch, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's one of those it's one
of those aspects where we put a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: different selection pressures on it,
but kept the name.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, we got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the ones often mentioned is the
cuttlefish, you know, like not often
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned, I should say.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the in the like late 2000s,
it was used a lot by Subcool's crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And best I could tell, I remember talking
to Jill about about it came from a bad
[SPEAKER_02]: boy, whoever that was, one of their
buddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was actually a super skunk crossed
a skunk, skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like a fruity.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say skunky fruity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure on all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that was what the cuttlefish
hash plant was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't even a sensei hash plant or seed
bank hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a super skunk, skunk one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we we had a bunch of people that were
just asking about the G 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we could focus on that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Fletch, you want to come in and talk
to you 13?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're from that area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I said before, one part of the
story is that Neville said on one of his
[SPEAKER_03]: American trips, he bought the G 13 and the
hash plant clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, from somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Fletch?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just hash plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hash plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old Northwest favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think something that people
forget is that the Northwest specifically,
[SPEAKER_01]: like Washington state, is where HID
lighting company came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where some of the first hydroponics
companies came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the early 80s, this was the spot to
grow weed because the climate is really
[SPEAKER_01]: good for having heat inside your house
generally all year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's always like, oh, the humidity
is so high up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you know anything about relative
humidity, air that's 45 degrees and 80%
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity, and you bring that into like a
75 degree grow room and hit it with all
[SPEAKER_01]: that heat from all your equipment,
makes a perfect climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you always hear people, oh,
there's mold or powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know tons of growers from up
here and powdery mildew never existed in
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone's garden until clones started
coming up specifically from Ed Rosenthal's
[SPEAKER_01]: operation in the late 90s, early 2000s
with the other lady's name that was
[SPEAKER_01]: running it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they would like, I mean, they spread
that shit worldwide.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you want to be known for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Centralized clone selling is really what
has spread most problems everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dudding, the viroids, the powdery
mildews, bugs, all these various different
[SPEAKER_03]: types of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: When people were just getting clones from
their buddy or a small group of friends,
[SPEAKER_03]: it kept most problems localized.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's when people start stop
maintaining their own mothers and will
[SPEAKER_03]: just like, oh, I'll fucking buy 200 cuts
for my next run and started getting them
[SPEAKER_03]: from dispensaries and getting them from
these centralized places.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of when all these issues
started spreading like crazy was because
[SPEAKER_03]: they get into a poorly run at Rosenthal's
situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they'd get into a dark heart or
whatever, and then they would just sell to
[SPEAKER_03]: thousands of people.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's talk some G-13.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you know, what you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he probably knows, but I will,
I will say one more thing and then I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: shut up is that, um, you know,
Neville says that he got it on this trip
[SPEAKER_03]: and Jorge confirmed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we interviewed, uh, Bjornsson,
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like the one tidbit that we got
was he, remember, he said that the G-13
[SPEAKER_03]: was actually called, um, the UW.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The UW.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what his statement was.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like literally an hour and a half
of, of talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the one piece of weed history
that he casually mentioned that like was,
[SPEAKER_03]: was any, but you know, it seems like it
was one of those, like, like Fletch was
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, it was one of those things where
they were collecting different clones that
[SPEAKER_03]: worked good indoors and trading them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even up here, people were really,
um, reserved about sharing any kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that was true, you know, probably up
until medical changed in like 2008 with,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Obama's, um, whatever that,
that, uh, announcement was where everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: basically started growing weed because it
said the feds weren't going to fuck with
[SPEAKER_01]: you anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before that, getting clones was hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people, you know, everybody,
just, if you had weed, you never told
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if it was from your garden,
I mean, there's plenty of people you buy
[SPEAKER_01]: weed from.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never knew they grew weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they just said their uncle got it or
whoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so, but the, the G, so what,
what were we talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: G-13 or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: G-13.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do G-13, UW stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so UW and well, G-13, as far as I
know, there's two, there's historically
[SPEAKER_01]: only two clones, Airborne, which is from
Ohio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's Pacific, which is from
out here, like West Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the Pacific was named Pacific because
of the user Pacific on Cannabis World.
[SPEAKER_01]: She, he, I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: She, she was like in some band or,
and I can't, she was some kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, modern shit of some sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then, but, um, she had two different
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's how she liked to be
referred to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it was the UW purple or I think,
didn't she call it UW purple, Matt?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: UW black or purple?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: People call it UW black now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said shit that people made up out of
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the UW purple, I think was,
and I think she would sometimes call it
[SPEAKER_01]: purple G-13 up here, but like having been
around here for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I never saw the, the UW purple or
purple that she had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the same as the purple Indica Tacoma
per family of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's well known up here in Washington,
which is like how me and Caleb ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming friends 20 years ago is cause he
had the Oracle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the PI from up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew those were families of plants that
were localized to our areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, we were trying to figure out,
Hey, are these things related?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they similar?
[SPEAKER_01]: And me personally having now worked with
the purple Indica a lot and knowing its
[SPEAKER_01]: history up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it wasn't called purple Indica
when I got it up here, it was just an
[SPEAKER_01]: unknown clone that I received and I was
just able to identify it as a plant from
[SPEAKER_01]: that family of purples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb and I, we got this other clone that
we called the Tacoma perk that came from a
[SPEAKER_01]: user stony puff and stuff on this world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a different clone,
but the same family of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also had pop bag seeds in like 2002 of
that from those bags of that same weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all almost identical to,
you know, you could have passed any of
[SPEAKER_01]: them off as any of the purple weed that
comes around up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that was kind of, that's kind of
the same with Oracle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, you've got Oracle for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: 71, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 different versions of the same
essentially genotype of expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A type phenotype within a population or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and it's hard to say whether the
chicken or the egg came for right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did the Oracle come first or did a GDP?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one came from which one?
[SPEAKER_01]: And unless you have, let's get the history
of it, it's pretty proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the G thirteens, the airborne G 13,
um, that I've seen is probably most
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely related to the lemon G AKA
lemon G 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was all as it was also called.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both carry this trait and it's also a,
um, I think it's a virus that transfers
[SPEAKER_01]: from it through seed from parents,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the actual data to support
exactly that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for example, the lemon peel that I
have is frost with that has a wrap or
[SPEAKER_01]: virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have tested for that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's had it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean like after the second run from
clone, it had it and I've never um,
[SPEAKER_01]: I, it doesn't transfer to any other
strains at all except for lemon G hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weird 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is really weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so does the lemon G itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of virus is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know wrap or virus?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raspberry door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you'd heard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, anyways, my point is simply that
there can even be, you know, stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that can show you, um, potentially a
genetic relation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I mean, we've never sold pure
lemon peel hybrids, you know, for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, I think, I think, uh, the,
the airborne is the one that PIP showed us
[SPEAKER_02]: not so the one that he was keeping his G
13 that he called Ohio G 13.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think he had a similar theory that
it, that it was related to the lemon G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he had the lemon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he, he rocked the lemon G,
like he monocropped it in that region for
[SPEAKER_03]: years too.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was really familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I will say that, you know,
one thing about the Pacific that makes me
[SPEAKER_03]: think that it's probably old is that it is
really ugly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not a pretty plant in my
opinion, which one the Pacific,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like, you know, like,
or PIPs very like the G like, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's kind of like, one of its things,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where it's like the G 13 was like,
when, when Neville would chat about it,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, he said it was,
it was, it was kind of ugly, but it had
[SPEAKER_03]: crazy, you know, it added, it added a
bunch of potency and a bunch of crystal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But by itself, it wasn't all that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I did all those high times events
and everything, you know, every once in a
[SPEAKER_01]: while you'd have someone come through that
you, and they were always old timers,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like these are more,
and they would just, just come through and
[SPEAKER_01]: just tell you some information about a
strain that you potentially have on your
[SPEAKER_01]: menu or have hybrids of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this older lady, Kate had come to my
booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was either at Emerald cup or
one of the other high times events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she told me, do you know what the
lemon G 13 is?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, I first had gotten it
from Shroomy back in like 2005 or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew it was old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew it was from Ohio cause he was in
Pittsburgh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was from right across the border
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, the lemon G was like,
you know, it, um, it's a very distinct
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't miss it for anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's smell, how it grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like just a really big plant
with big buds, but kind of not the most
[SPEAKER_01]: resonance thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, she said that it was the,
um, G 13, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from out there with a skunk misty
from sensi seeds that hermied onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read that story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes perfect sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the plants, if you've ever
grown, it does have skunk number one type
[SPEAKER_01]: growth characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where those long running colas came
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: From number one from Amsterdam,
then if you've grown the airborne G 13
[SPEAKER_01]: that weird and sour, bitter smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from the airborne G.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like, you can smell it between
the airborne and it's, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so like I was saying,
between all those factors, plus the dwarf
[SPEAKER_01]: virus that's, that's self contained to
that specific family of plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's pretty identifiable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say for certain whether or not
it's all a hundred percent the same
[SPEAKER_01]: family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of covers the, the airborne G
13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most likely a clone from Ohio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know any other history other
than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most likely the parent to lemon G as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I know as well about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Survived in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a little off topic, but since we
touched a little bit, what do you think on
[SPEAKER_02]: the purple indica versus Urkel?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's what I was going to say
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown enough PI hybrids that I've
gotten Urkel phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: From purple indica hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wouldn't surprise me in the least,
especially considering how widespread that
[SPEAKER_01]: purple indica clone or that family of
clones was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would bet money if you, if you showed
that purple indica to Greg, that he would
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately be able to identify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like every other guy I know that's
been up in Seattle and Northern Oregon for
[SPEAKER_01]: the last 30 years growing weed,
almost every single one of them you can
[SPEAKER_01]: pull out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's immediately identifiable by them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see what he says.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'd like to do is go out there and
bring him a bunch of samples and see if he
[SPEAKER_01]: can identify anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys close?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you guys are kind of close out
there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean relative.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but you, you know what I'm saying
though, is that like, who knows what kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of smells he could potentially identify as
just being related to something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like I was talking about the lemon G
and the G 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Pacific G 13, I never saw
anything, but a couple of samples of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it never was very impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Udub purple, that purple family that
we were just talking about purple indica,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are definitely not related to the
Pacific G 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Udub was just a name for any weed
that came out of the university of
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington area of Seattle, which was like
kind of where you would go buy weed off
[SPEAKER_01]: the streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, kind of like in park in New York
kind of deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, go down to the U district and
you could buy weed off the streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you had, you know, between that,
the glass blowers, which was a giant part
[SPEAKER_01]: that is often overlooked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost over as if it wasn't an important
part of it, but the glass blowing scene
[SPEAKER_01]: was a large part of the distribution
network of clones around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the country back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when I first got the Trinity and
the, and the snow and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a bunch of those things that was all out
of Eugene glass blowing circles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was all, that was,
that was one of the ways that hippies
[SPEAKER_03]: spread and communicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and they were, they were blowing
pipes and they, they had ends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dog shit, same channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try and think of other strains that were
glass scene, the super bill, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a, there's a handful of strains up
here that, that maybe haven't gotten any
[SPEAKER_01]: air time, but the cough was super traveled
through the, through the glass blowing
[SPEAKER_01]: scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the cough was like a, Oh,
somebody just said the Quimby.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another Quimby.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Quimby is just another is from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just another like old school was one
of those strains passed around those same
[SPEAKER_03]: circles.
[SPEAKER_03]: The green.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they, they even had their own
four way, which wasn't like a four way
[SPEAKER_03]: from, was like a four way from Oregon,
but they just called it the same thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it wasn't anything related to
Neville's or anything from Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like Trinity by something,
by something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember, but that was,
that's my knowledge of G 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, it's somewhat anecdotal,
but I've seen a lot of samples,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hold on a sec.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are saying we're not just hearing
facts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're hearing conjecture about G 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason for that is because the G 13 is
from the eighties, which is a long fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: time ago and the memories are old and some
of them are legends.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we, what we think we know for sure is
that it came out of the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when it first popped up and
friends of Jorge Cervantes gave it to
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville who took it to Europe and bred
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can add to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the name supposedly came from the
license plate as best as I've dug out the
[SPEAKER_03]: license plates license.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, and so it became, and it became
traded.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then it was bred in the Europe and then
it was traded in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it kind of became this legendary
thing for the most part.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so some of it is conjecture because
you have all these things called G 13,
[SPEAKER_03]: but what's their origin?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one thing I'd like to mention is
that when I first started growing G 13 was
[SPEAKER_01]: not a really well-known subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing was some intellect folklore
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that it was in the catalog
back in the day, that was the only
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no one really gave a shit at all about
it until that movie, American,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: American beauty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thousand dollar ounce of G 13 on the
fucking American beauty movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everybody's like, what's that G
13 shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that some shit came from the
government.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing that happened with
Udub is like, when I was buying weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: Udub was just a, came from an area,
could be multiple different strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like Crippy or any of those other
names.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the single variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you had like the medical
scene around here pop up, and you had
[SPEAKER_01]: people trying to like kind of stake their
claim in the ground, but didn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't really in the scene prior to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, I have the original Udub.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, dude, there never even was,
like the fact that you're even trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: say you have the only Udub is how I know
you don't have it because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're trying to stake a claim about
something that was just a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't specified to a variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like thunderfuck, you know,
all those other ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even, or even diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my, my buddies who lived in New
York in that era, that was, that was slang
[SPEAKER_03]: for, for dank weed right then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it that diesel?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got that diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, now it like means something much
more specific, but it started off as just
[SPEAKER_03]: slang for good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no Indian guy did not have anything to
do with G 13 people making up stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so while we have you here,
let's touch on another hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we've done this before,
but I don't think we've done it on the
[SPEAKER_02]: syndicate show, uh, HP 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my only experience with it is that
I went to those parties in Hawaii,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, back in the early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, and that's the same,
the Jason King, Canna Bible group of
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the only place I ever saw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was well known amongst their circle
that it had come from New York city or
[SPEAKER_01]: from New York somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's not from Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was brought there by it, from my
understanding, a bunch of hippies.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's basically, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what'd you think about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I always deserve the hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when I first saw it and it was like
jungle grown, I was like, Oh hell no,
[SPEAKER_01]: this shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I got the clone later from,
uh, from Caleb and, um, I grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked the Terps on it a lot,
but doesn't transfer to flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it itself, um, it's more one of
those strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can taste it because it smells so
strong, not because it converts to a
[SPEAKER_01]: really tasty flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's Hermi prone the lower
bottoms on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always through sacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would have light leaks or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it's pretty hard to breed with in
my experience, but it has one of the more
[SPEAKER_01]: unique terping profiles out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one thing Jason King was correct
about is that the, the terp profile is
[SPEAKER_02]: unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always, it's always a bummer to me
when the terp profile is so strong and
direct.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it doesn't translate into the
smoke like bubble gum, like, like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: but like, like, yeah, like the version of
bubble gum, you know, it smells sometimes
[SPEAKER_03]: the smell and the, you know, I mean,
that's the same thing true with hash too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes flavors on flour don't translate
into any of the hash you make with it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that HP 13 doesn't have a good
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, it's so strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You expect it, it promises to deliver more
than it actually does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the smell is so potent on it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but what's what it, what, one thing
I've found with having run through so many
[SPEAKER_01]: seed plants over so many years is that
there's this fine line between,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, there's like three different types of
textures of wheat in my main textures.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really terpy stuff that's low in
THC and it kind of has that soft silky
[SPEAKER_01]: feel to the resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not tacky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't wash with it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have like the other end of the
spectrum, which is like really high in
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, but whatever terpenes are in it,
don't make it slick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like alcohol and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You add enough alcohol to water and it
won't freeze.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you most terpenes and, and files and
everything else in it are like alcohol,
[SPEAKER_01]: like compounds, they have low free.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you mix that with THC,
you need enough THC to stabilize the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have really terpy, low THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of has that soft feel and it,
sometimes the shit just doesn't translate
[SPEAKER_01]: to flavor no matter how terpy it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have this stuff that's like all THC,
but no terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and that shit washes like crazy,
but it always lacks in flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have stuff where it's really
fucking terpy and it's really high in THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's that stick to the wall type shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's almost always the best to smoke
is those.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like, that's like all of the old
elites that ended up testing between 18
[SPEAKER_03]: and 24% THC or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just had that blend of terps and
flavor and enough potency to get you
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Entourage effect, whatever you want to,
it was interesting for me seeing a bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: of holding a big library.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when testing first started,
it happening and you started getting to
[SPEAKER_03]: see what your weed was like me realizing
that, like, I mean, I don't, I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: about, I don't know about you Flush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really like most 30% plus
strengths.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of find them bland.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the ones that work best for me,
like are somewhere in the, in the low to
[SPEAKER_03]: mid twenties, most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't just taste really strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even care about the potency of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, I mean,
you know, I used to have Joe, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: still have, hundreds of jars available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone comes over and they can smoke
through whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that purple indica only tests like 15
to 18% on a good day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for 20 years, no matter what everybody
picked out of my pile of jars to smoke,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd always say that was the most potent
strain to them had the most narcotic
[SPEAKER_01]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously THC isn't the only thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is there's hundreds of
known cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only test for like 10 of them,
maybe in bio assays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, and we've just found, like,
did you guys see that Italian research
[SPEAKER_01]: paper where they found that THC that's 30
times more potent than THC and they found
[SPEAKER_01]: it in flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have 1% of that, that's the
equivalent of 30% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have flour that's 20% THC and
then have 100% of this secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid that we currently don't test
for THCP, if that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit might feel like it's 50%,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you've got 30% with that extra
potent stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, it's like heroin and
fentanyl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for people asking, this will be up on
YouTube after we're going to try to have
[SPEAKER_02]: it up in audio as well later on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's, that's kind of a tangent,
but it's basically, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's absolutely no way, you know,
to, to tell like how well weed is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: work on someone by the available testing
that we commonly do today.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get a general sense of low or high
THC and you can get some terpenes and you
[SPEAKER_03]: can learn some things from it,
but it's not comprehensive enough by any
[SPEAKER_03]: means to, to tell you why, why it works
the way that it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're, you're talking about,
we're only testing for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: five or 10% of the potential cannabinoids,
most of which the other cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't even know what they do still.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, then you're talking about,
we test for a small portion of the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and thiols and everything else
that produces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, we're going to start making
assumptions with 10% of the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to, yeah, that's bad at
assumptions about the plants with 10% of
[SPEAKER_01]: the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty useless science right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like phylose creating a whole
system on it, telling you you could have
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic relation with about the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also quite possible that we put
the most importance on THC simply because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's the oldest compound we know of that
relates to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we've just, we've just all been
preconditioned to accept that that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: big macro.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you know why we're preconditioned is
because that's the compound they made
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's the one that the
government said was the most important
[SPEAKER_01]: compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's at the end of the day,
it's probably not.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of what my whole point,
we could, we could know 15 or 20 years
[SPEAKER_03]: from now that this combination of
cannabinoids or whatever is actually way
[SPEAKER_03]: more important to like this specific
feeling than any number on that level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so, and now, and all these
people breeding for 32% THC with no terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of service and still smokes like fucking
smoking gravel.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all because we're using a testing
system to sell stuff to consumers that
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't even in their best interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Fletch, you said something the
other day, and I know it, it didn't,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a lot of people found it
controversial, but I thought I could
[SPEAKER_02]: relate to it very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you made a comment that you are done
with regular seeds and it's on defense
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you, can you like extrapolate on that
a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: So people understand what you were
actually saying, saying, Oh, I'm just
[SPEAKER_02]: making jokes most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, but I mean, but it's relevant,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: People take this shit way too seriously,
but I mean, you know, the, the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: always have the most to say are typically
the people that are offended by it the
[SPEAKER_01]: most, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe they're not so proud of what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I just related to it so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to sell regular seeds in this
market right now is, is very, very
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not as much of a, I don't even
know if there is a big market left for
[SPEAKER_02]: regular seeds at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, most people aren't
particularly, you know, especially with
[SPEAKER_01]: the compression and pricing, people are
not concerned with doing things the right
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're concerned with how they're going
to pay their bills and make it to the next
[SPEAKER_01]: crop or keep the lights on at their
facility or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, that's why you got people that
are like, you know, they got a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: lights up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know what to do with any of the
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their choices at that point are I'm
going to partner with someone that's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to run the thing and sell it all for me,
or I'm going to start hitting up people
[SPEAKER_01]: that work at nurseries of other
businesses, tell their nursery employee,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'll give you 50 grand to buy a clone
from whoever, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then trying to undercut their market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, look, you're, you're never
going to create a market for yourself by
[SPEAKER_01]: always just picking up the scraps of
somebody else's.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fact, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, what's the point of picking
up someone else's scraps?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you should be working on your
own stuff because then you can,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can, then you can have enough
burn rate on whatever that product is for
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself that you can take advantage of
that and be proud of what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, that shit won't offend you
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fact, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I've learned too, is that all
these dudes that like to knock stuff off,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what they do for a living.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all going to come to a screeching
halt when a lot of the people that are
[SPEAKER_02]: producing unique shit are no longer doing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, once those people are removed
from the equation, then who's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: make the unique shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: No one.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're cut off.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, what's the, what's the point in
all just chopping each other's legs off
[SPEAKER_01]: when we could all just be producing
something, only a generation or two
[SPEAKER_01]: removed, but is now because you did your
work and found something cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the market's bigger instead of
smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you guys want to survive,
you better work on making the market
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger for everybody that's in it,
not smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of reminds me of like the,
just like the, the human nature aspects of
[SPEAKER_03]: all this shit, you know, because there's a
part of it too, where, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you think about it like in music or
something like that, when there's like
[SPEAKER_03]: something, you know, people come out and
they just create something and then that
[SPEAKER_03]: creates a demand for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's a whole bunch of other
musicians who follow in their footsteps
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's easier than creating their
own thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there's like a, now there's like a
heavy metal genre.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like a gangster rap genre.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like a, there's an era where like
it's not named.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are just doing shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what's happened with the,
with the named, with the named,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, strain game basically,
is that rather than people breeding a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of weed that they like and trying to
get more weed that they like, they're
[SPEAKER_03]: like, Oh fuck, this thing from,
you know, Archive or Matt or whoever is,
[SPEAKER_03]: is blowing up right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to cross everything to Dusty
Dough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to cross everything to Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to cross everything to
Cushman's.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to cross everything to,
because it's popular and they're trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: put their own flavor on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not like it just happens in weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That happens anywhere where there's
opportunity.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, the other thing I was
thinking of when you guys were talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about the breeding aspect was that even
talking about Seeds Today, when,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, when Neville was on Mr. Nice or
whatever he used to talk about,
[SPEAKER_03]: people would all the time bitch that they
wanted all these pure Indica hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they didn't yield through the roof
and they weren't amazing in every way,
[SPEAKER_03]: they bitch up a storm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he was constantly thinking about
like what he could release and what the
[SPEAKER_03]: public would accept.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it made me think that even today right
now where you got, there's a difference
[SPEAKER_03]: between what the public says it wants and
then where it's money talks in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it says it wants a lot of stuff that
it doesn't really support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the price compression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everybody's looking for, everyone
wants something different, but they all
[SPEAKER_01]: want to sell the, have the same sales
strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple frosty and want to sell a hundred
pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, I mean, they're not everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are companies that are
phenom hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're working on, on providing unique
varieties to their business, regardless of
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not it's a hype strain or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're in all markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's, you know, there's a,
there's a good amount of those companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that are working on it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem becomes, depending on how
big their business is, is the most
[SPEAKER_01]: productive varieties typically aren't the
dankest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're selling to a wholesale only
market and aren't vertically integrated,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really hard to grow a two pound
variety instead of a three pound variety
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever the difference is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like fruits and vegetables,
the big old monster tomatoes typically are
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones that taste like water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's, that's like, uh,
one of Caleb and I's running jokes,
[SPEAKER_03]: dude, is that the shitty little thing in
the corner that you thought about killing
[SPEAKER_03]: ends up being the clear winner in the
smoke test.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, why is that retarded runt
over there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, why is that one head and shoulders
above all these beautiful producing
[SPEAKER_03]: structure, amazing dense buds all over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this stressed out little thing here
that almost died.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one that wants the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a, I think the, the smoke
ability of a strain is a combination of
[SPEAKER_01]: two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, it's the type of,
and how much resin there is on the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there is how the plant material
smokes itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are two completely different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why people like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hash is cause you get rid of all the plant
materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the shit that like has good turps
or good trichomes on it, but shitty plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material, you can smoke it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, man, the flower is completely
nothing to write home about, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: make some fresh frozen hash with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Banana smoothie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there, you know, there's a purpose for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you start talking about like mass
versus trichomes, if you increase the
[SPEAKER_01]: mass, but there's only the same amount of
trichomes, it's inevitably probably going
[SPEAKER_01]: to continue to taste worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever has the least amount of mass
that smokes poorly of flower material with
[SPEAKER_01]: the highest concentration of resin,
good tasty resin is probably going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: your best wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, it's just a trichome
concentration versus plant mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look at it a little differently because
I talk about burnability all the time,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's really important to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that there's like a,
there's like an air to bud ratio,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like, I mean, obviously some
things you put them on this, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you put them on and, and the thing is
huge, but it weighs three grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other thing you put it on and it's the
same, it's the same size and it weighs
[SPEAKER_03]: eight, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think like how dense things are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like one of the things I like about
diesels is it kind of has all those like
[SPEAKER_03]: nooks and crannies and hills and crevices
and different things, the way the bud
[SPEAKER_03]: forms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, it's not that dense,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think that makes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was saying is the amount of
trichomes versus the mass of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material, the plant material.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems like that stuff washes better
because there's more surface area where
[SPEAKER_03]: like the super thick stuff, you almost
have to chop it up into little bits to get
[SPEAKER_03]: it to wash well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause there's only so much exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much better can you get on X amount of
mass of flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's things like Bubba, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, you could,
Bubba doesn't have a lot of surface area
[SPEAKER_01]: to put trichomes because it's so dense
with plant material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why does it test low?
[SPEAKER_01]: And why does one little nudge like this
turn into like a joint that's fucking that
[SPEAKER_01]: fat?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why, because it has a lot of plant
material mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was, there was an aspect
too, where I used to have this,
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to have this judge of whether I
thought things were like perfect density
[SPEAKER_03]: to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I was breeding stuff,
a bunch was, could I break it off in the
[SPEAKER_03]: dark and put it into a pipe and smoke it
effectively?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if, and if you can't do that without
like the snow used to be like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: like you almost needed scissors or a
grinder, you know, if you just broke off a
[SPEAKER_03]: big chunk and shoved it into a bowl or a
bong or something like that, it would
[SPEAKER_03]: barely burn.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prohibition selection standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and you know, cookies,
cookies, cookies can be like that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be too dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it breeds a certain density.
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you been focusing on in on your
projects lately?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like is there anything you're stoked
about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything you're working with lately that
you're like, fuck, this is so unique and
[SPEAKER_02]: so different.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I, you know, I'm going to work on
this for a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything like that currently going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, man, I'm just always just
selecting through plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I just popped like another 500
seeds the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's, I just want to find new shit
all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, shit half the time, all like,
I just went to California and went to all
[SPEAKER_01]: these big grows and everything and met up
with everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, everybody,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the like, the one that I wasn't really
particularly impressed with was the one
[SPEAKER_01]: that all the biggest growers all said,
Hey, can I get a clone?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up with that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to, I need to, I need to make this
one a strain or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, I didn't even think
that was that out of all the stuff I
[SPEAKER_01]: brought, that's not my personal favorite,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, it's like, I never really know
what's fucking, I just try to grow really
[SPEAKER_01]: good weeds and shit that I think is unique
and tastes really good and has that,
[SPEAKER_01]: the right ratios, everything we were just
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, everybody, I let everybody else
decide what, what's really unique to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you told me, you know,
10 years that papaya would be unique to
[SPEAKER_01]: people, I'd tell you you're fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most run of the mill shit on
the fucking planet at that time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so only 10 years later, you know,
Dutch skunk number one fruit turps is
[SPEAKER_01]: unique because everyone grows only gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had told me skunk one would have
had a comeback.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would never in a million years have
believed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was, there, there was a
time, you know, in Mendo where you
[SPEAKER_03]: couldn't give a Cali O pound away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, and then the nails got
invented and people started dabbing and
[SPEAKER_03]: Tangy became popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I couldn't believe Tangy when it,
when it hit, I was like, what,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are we redoing Cali O again?
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck's going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but we forget that, you know,
the majority of the smoking population is
[SPEAKER_01]: 18 to 28 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after most people turn 28, they get
kids, family, they smoke less,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that shit, whatever was old to the
people that just quit smoking is brand new
[SPEAKER_01]: to the next generation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we, we, we had a, we had a,
like a 15 year downturn for perps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it came back with a vengeance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: With a vengeance.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there, there was an era a long
time ago when, when everything purple went
[SPEAKER_03]: like crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that wasn't the case for decade
and a half or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it came back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of a sudden, you know,
I, you hear that like very 2005 statement,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like, I don't know if this is
purple enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could this be darker?
[SPEAKER_01]: You see people extending the periods for
these strains now by like adding two novel
[SPEAKER_01]: things together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got like Tropicana cookies and it's
like just Tangy, but it's purple,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the Blackberry, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people are like excited about it
again, you know, Mendo perp, same thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's like people get tired of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's just the Mendo perp,
but you know, call it forbidden fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's the hot shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's crazy about the forbidden fruit is
that when citrus is strong, it's like one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the most dominant, it can be,
it can breed one of the most dominant
[SPEAKER_03]: turps at times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and then, and then it's,
and it's often a one or two note turk
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's like, you don't get other
scents.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, when it's citrus, it's just
like, like pop its citrus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that forbidden fruit is really weird
because it smells just like, it's like a
[SPEAKER_03]: one note purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty plant, you know,
pretty, pretty, super pretty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, uh, and all that and you know,
but yeah, it's, it just, it smells like if
[SPEAKER_03]: you like orange citrus and that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think here's a, an important thing
to, I think what we're talking about is
[SPEAKER_01]: really a product of the, how, easily
information is spread nowadays because
[SPEAKER_01]: like you were talking about before how,
uh, plant diseases were isolated to small
[SPEAKER_01]: groups of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if at all, because people didn't
really share plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing was true with the selling
part of weed 20 years ago as well is I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know what the fuck people were
smoking in Georgia or Tennessee,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know what I can buy around me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I didn't have this, this
preconception that I can get some purple
[SPEAKER_01]: weed that smells like orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was not choices like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody just basically created their
own standards of quality and preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were localized to even just
small groups of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's why we had so many
unique strains that, that we're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prohibition is because the whole market
wasn't gelato or whatever, because no one
[SPEAKER_01]: had a big enough row to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one knew about a strain enough to do
all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, every, so like strains
like HP 13 survived because that was the
[SPEAKER_01]: best weed that a whole group of people in
the country could get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they demanded that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that clone survived and that,
you know, that was one of the benefits of
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that it actually did help keep some of
the diversity alive because you have these
[SPEAKER_01]: independent markets that weren't affected
from external sort of external input.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we have the opposite where
everyone is so influenced by external
[SPEAKER_01]: input that almost no one keeps anything
unique around anymore at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the customer doesn't even know that
they want it because it's not even
[SPEAKER_01]: available in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I mean, that's something I trip on all
the time is because like California,
[SPEAKER_03]: like in, in some degree, like,
or where I live might be considered kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of like a, you know, the forefront of
certain things, good and bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the bad things was like the,
the whole like named clone craze that took
[SPEAKER_03]: off where, you know, first it was purples
and it was cushions and sours and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, but what that meant is that people
kept dropping stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we talked earlier in the show about
how that G 13 cut probably survived in
[SPEAKER_03]: Ohio because like you, you, you grow weed
in these areas where it's good enough weed
[SPEAKER_03]: that it always sells and there's not
pressure to change.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they keep these favorites wherever in
Ohio, Ohio is, are they even legal yet or
[SPEAKER_03]: no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just meant like anywhere,
anywhere that doesn't fate like California
[SPEAKER_03]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to me, the first real praise was the
purple craze in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before that people just grew good weed and
it all sold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when the purple craze hit and it
became about the Mendo P or the Urkel or
[SPEAKER_03]: the GDP or, you know, this half a dozen
different purple strains, there would be
[SPEAKER_03]: people that would come up from the Bay and
they will like, I will buy every gram of
[SPEAKER_03]: this weed that I can find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that created this pressure where
all these different growers were like,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, why do I want to grow this other
shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to turn this 40 lights or
whatever into Urkel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And boom it out because these people are
going to cash me out even for my odd
[SPEAKER_03]: pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with every time that happens,
diversity gets fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you fast forward, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fast forward 15 years from then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when the purple craze hit,
everybody starts hitting up like the six
[SPEAKER_03]: people that kept purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like everyone I knew had an
Urkel or a grape ape or a, or a GDP or a
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendo P. Cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there was an era after that
where like every single farmer I knew
[SPEAKER_03]: indoor and outdoor ran some sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's not, if it's not what the
easiest thing to, to sell, then they drop
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys feel like we're in that stage
right now currently with anything where a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of shit's getting dropped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'll tell you something crazy,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a buddy from, from Sohum hit me up
and say that a bunch of brokers were
[SPEAKER_03]: starting to talk about wanting sour diesel
this year and they couldn't, they couldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: find clones of sour diesel in Sohum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it'd been three, four years and
everybody's been growing gelatos and weird
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrids of gelato and these weird purple
crosses and jealousy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, and that was the only thing
that people wanted to pay for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't think sour would get pushed
out, but it doesn't take that long.
[SPEAKER_03]: All it takes is a few seasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or one season of your broker telling you,
I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to find something though
they, they do want, you know, or they tell
[SPEAKER_03]: you, oh, I'll buy that, but it's,
it's going to be this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you had this, I'd pay you this much
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to go that route.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely doesn't have the cookies
appeal at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't, you know, but it's like,
but everyone had sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's a global of the
marketplace, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it really is a nationalization,
but California supplying is globally at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just like, you know,
kind of when you travel the world
[SPEAKER_01]: nowadays, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not nearly as culturally diverse,
especially in the touristy areas than 20
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago or in particularly 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I ever experienced that,
but it's just where we have this
[SPEAKER_01]: information is disseminated so quickly
nowadays that it's that we're losing a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of diversity on the planet for a lot of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with cannabis, particularly because it
was prohibited by the governments,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have probably the very last
agricultural crop that had its own free
[SPEAKER_01]: independent economy and distribution
system for a lot of a multi-billion dollar
[SPEAKER_01]: planet plant per year in value with
absolutely zero government intervention
[SPEAKER_01]: and policies that would dictate how and
why people would operate their business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now move to the whole opposite with
that, with globalization and
[SPEAKER_01]: nationalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: With one exception to that, they didn't
have any control over how we set it up
[SPEAKER_03]: except for things they did would make us
adapt to not encounter them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the shipping methods, all the
various aspects of the business was to
[SPEAKER_03]: work around government intervention of any
kind.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they didn't really dictate to us,
but they did influence how we responded in
[SPEAKER_03]: a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of that, we had a much more
diverse scene because everybody figured
[SPEAKER_01]: out a different way to manipulate the
system to their advantage, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really was Adam Smith and the invisible
hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys familiar with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Adam Smith, when he wrote about
capitalism and all that, it's like a super
[SPEAKER_03]: famous thing that he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he wrote about basically like real
capitalism is like there's an invisible
[SPEAKER_03]: hand that takes the goods from where they
are and pulls them to where they're wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: to be bought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's a system that will get set up
if there's a demand in some place and
[SPEAKER_03]: there's margin and profit to be made.
[SPEAKER_03]: A system will be set up by people to get
that profit and to bring the goods to
[SPEAKER_03]: where the people want to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's essentially what happened with
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how weed got spread all over
America when it was totally illegal was
[SPEAKER_03]: the invisible hand divvied it up.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and then the invisible hand is
just no government, no government making
[SPEAKER_03]: any rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's interesting that like in
California, especially they made a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of rules and they crashed the very
successful system within five years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won war that we've waged in the last
50 years in this country where we won it,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it was a foreign war or a domestic
war.
[SPEAKER_01]: The war on drugs, shit, drugs are more
available and more plentiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't win any wars, war on
homelessness.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't win anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if they're meant to be won.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's no profit in solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no profit in collapsing an
agricultural commodity that you're the one
[SPEAKER_01]: taxing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the funny part is the government is
so bad at their job that they're the only
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that make money without having to
spend any in this real business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, other than, other than just
enforcing the rules that they that get
[SPEAKER_01]: written, but they're taking in what a
third of the income and the whole state or
[SPEAKER_01]: more in most of these cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and the biggest loser is them by
collapsing the system around themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if the if the price of weed goes
to basically non-profitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, look, I've talked about this
for a long ass time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without subsidies and or farmers unions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farming in America doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been doom and gloom forever about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here now.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he has.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been talking about subsidies and
collapsing markets and what happens with
[SPEAKER_03]: industrialization and all that for quite
some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the biggest benefit,
right, is because there's no union and no
[SPEAKER_01]: subsidies to get this to survive,
that the consumption of weed is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people are just there's
nothing to save these big corporations and
[SPEAKER_01]: these big investment firms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing to save them.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a in the right scenario,
depending on how much it ends up costing a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of these big businesses to operate and
how the consumers perception and demands
[SPEAKER_01]: may change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Small farms might be the ones that come
out winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there isn't as we're seeing now in
California and as the as every state gets
[SPEAKER_01]: its own supply set up and there's not this
distribution network, this demand from all
[SPEAKER_01]: over the world for export product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're growing way more weed than people
need to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all it takes is the consumer demanding
a little bit higher quality product and
[SPEAKER_01]: the consumption amount or the amount of
players.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those being too many for the amount of
consumption that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only things that may be profitable
is small businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you guys, did you guys not to
interrupt?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you guys see that thing in Canada
where they destroyed like hundreds of tons
[SPEAKER_03]: of unused weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: They burned it because of overproduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they couldn't pump it through the
system and it aged out and turned brown.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they had all these huge
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they did this big power play.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an aspect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting that you say that,
dude, because there is definitely a bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: of people that are trying to get into the
industry by just having a better burn rate
[SPEAKER_03]: than small farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they're hoping to do is bleed
everybody out, be able to survive longer
[SPEAKER_03]: because they have more capital and then
take over the bones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they end up with a bunch of market
share.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what Homi is saying is that they could
actually bleed out beyond where they're
[SPEAKER_03]: willing to bleed.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the price spike doesn't happen
after that, to like be able to recover
[SPEAKER_03]: their lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to do is they're willing to
lose money now, but they're planning on
[SPEAKER_03]: making more later.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just get the plan is not to just
light a huge pile of money on fire and
[SPEAKER_03]: watch it burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they actually exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But their problem is that now that people
are growing weed more easily everywhere.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more quantity of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, Oklahoma has intercepted
pick six the whole game from California in
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to continue to happen
with every new state that comes online.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes easy to grow more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, like, you know, companies like truly
even Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you've got companies like Jungle
Boys and everybody else that can come in
[SPEAKER_01]: and take their lunch from them from a from
a business operations standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And quality perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got the little small
grower chipping away at you, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, like the market may not
sustain their billion dollar aspirations
[SPEAKER_01]: that you may not be able to be that big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing that in Washington
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest growers in Washington are
shutting down two thousand light
[SPEAKER_01]: operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're selling two hundred dollar
packaged pounds wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thousand light grows that bring in buyers
from out of state buy it from the from the
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed place that they deposit cash and
the state knows about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like the supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there's so many operations to supply
the demand now that I don't think there is
[SPEAKER_01]: like a rosy outcome for them down the
road.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they might just be lighting lighting
tens of millions of dollars on fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if they can't find more money to
keep sustaining their money losing
[SPEAKER_01]: operations, it's they're done for anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, canopy growth shut down
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did they spend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Two hundred and thirty million dollars on
a greenhouse in Medicine Hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sold it for thirty five million
recently just to keep the lights on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, you know, you can't run a
business like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, now, Flo Khanna up by me,
they raised one hundred and seventy five
[SPEAKER_03]: million bucks and they they pretty much
blew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so where's the ground going to come
from when the economics looks the way it
[SPEAKER_01]: does now?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, and there's another aspect
of it, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we were chatting about
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember if it was last week or
the week before.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like it is this weird thing because
since cannabis is legal in some spots and
[SPEAKER_03]: illegal in others.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the and the and the line between the
two is super murky.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all this there's all this stuff
happening where most of the companies in
[SPEAKER_03]: California are surviving by backdooring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's how they're surviving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then and then on top of that,
like up in, you know, when the hemp when
[SPEAKER_03]: the hemp implosion happened in 2018 up in
his neck of the woods in southern Oregon
[SPEAKER_03]: and all those areas, those places started
growing at a level never before seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's all these there's all these
criminal groups and cartels that started
[SPEAKER_03]: doing things on a scale that had never
been seen before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And daring the authorities to come catch
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's massive amounts of weed
that are being grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've read in places that that,
you know, Mexican Mexican import is down
[SPEAKER_03]: 75 percent from from the good days for
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and they are going into all kinds of
different businesses to make up that lost
[SPEAKER_03]: revenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to Oregon and they're
going to the desert in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're setting up these huge depths
and shops trying to make money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like a total free for all in that
sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like the level of
overproduction is insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody thinks that, like,
it's going to get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, look, for just every person
that's quitting right now, there's another
[SPEAKER_01]: person doubling up their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another glass house putting up
another five million square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't going to get that much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to identify your own market and
then supply that market, whatever it is
[SPEAKER_01]: that you do, whether it's edibles,
vape pens, these turp carts, rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick your pick your thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the market can only sustain so much of
that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you start basically eating into
your own profits with your overproduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, as more people become
operational, more good operators come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: More good black market operators continue
producing more states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it fizzles out for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it just can't sustain the size of
business that they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like these people spent three hundred
million dollars building this big grow
[SPEAKER_01]: because they were planning on doing a
billion dollars a year in sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they only got to one hundred and fifty
million a year in sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's going to be the reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a lot of these big businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you get these really big
overproduction situations like you have
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, you're going to see people
shutting lights off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is, is like as soon as the
like, all right, let's say you have a 2000
[SPEAKER_01]: light operation and you're going to shut
it down for the time being because you
[SPEAKER_01]: have two of these, let's say you shut one
down and you're like, well, we'll just
[SPEAKER_01]: wait till the price goes back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what happens when the price goes
back up?
[SPEAKER_01]: You flip the lights back on, fill it with
plants and a year later, the price is back
[SPEAKER_01]: where it was again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is, you know, ag economics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the real question is how much covid
cash did we spend on grows that don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: to exist?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's really big, which I think it
is, this overproduction will continue for
[SPEAKER_01]: quite some time, I would think.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really, it's it's two giants with
a bunch of good weed growers getting
[SPEAKER_03]: smashed in the middle, in my opinion,
because it's like all the like the two
[SPEAKER_03]: giants are like the all the huge black
market things that have set up by the
[SPEAKER_03]: various groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other giant is all the
backdoor legal weed that happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why legal is so pissed at
the black market is because for the first
[SPEAKER_03]: two, three years, they were dumping all
their excess product in the black easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was their cash flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now now they're getting cut off by
these ginormous scenes and they're pissed
[SPEAKER_03]: off about it and it's taking their price
and it's making their life harder.
[SPEAKER_03]: But but you know, so they want they want
all the black to be shut down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they only want the black to be shut
down so they could resupply the black.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just lost market share.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't care about the white or black
sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want market share.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just need market share wherever
they're going to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they define what's white and what's
black.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, the ones hiring the lobbyists
and are going to be hiring the lobbyists.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they define what's white and black
anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, I worked on some on some big
farms down in Southern California for a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that the sales guy
did that was pretty trippy is he went and
[SPEAKER_03]: he looked at a bunch of the data for all
of the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was pretty much like, you know,
this farm that we have down here,
[SPEAKER_03]: it could probably supply like 80 or 90
percent of the volume needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was like kind of from the real
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was kind of tripping out by this
number because he didn't know all the
[SPEAKER_03]: various nuances that we know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but he was just looking at it
and he was thinking about all the other
[SPEAKER_03]: bigger farms than us and all the indoors
and all the depths and all the everything
[SPEAKER_03]: else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was like, well, how is this
working?
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way that the white market can
survive is if like 80 percent of them
[SPEAKER_03]: fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're if they actually have to sell
within the state of California only and no
[SPEAKER_01]: back door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the goal would be instead of like
two or three huge companies that suck,
[SPEAKER_03]: that that percentage would be a bunch of
bomb small growers that could actually
[SPEAKER_03]: give consumers what they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what I'm getting at is that
it actually shrinks back to the size that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's that's actually sustainable for the
state of California, not including the
[SPEAKER_01]: export market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of these big grows are too big for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're they just can't get enough
revenue to sustain the business model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have two choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: They either just shut off a bunch of
operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep their 200 million a year or
whatever it is they could get or and they
[SPEAKER_01]: just hope they can hold on to that from
little guys that keep chopping at their at
[SPEAKER_01]: their bottom line or at the top line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, this may go back the other
direction and people don't realize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if people focus on quality,
expanding their market instead of chopping
[SPEAKER_01]: off your fellow farmers market,
the black market operators or backdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: operators or whoever you are, you're going
to continue to see growth in your space
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be my that's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could even say 20 years ago,
the people that I knew that were running
[SPEAKER_03]: 50 and 100 lighters that were really good
at their job, they still bought their head
[SPEAKER_03]: stash from four to 10 to 12 lighters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because those that there's just something
about like a smaller space that only you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, like you can you can there's like
nobody agrees where craft ends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody nobody agrees when it's like it's
just a little too big to be called craft.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can but everybody agrees that the
bigger it gets, the harder it becomes to
[SPEAKER_03]: manage perfect weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a guy that like works on his
four lighter after work and is in love
[SPEAKER_03]: with it and spends a couple hours in there
every night making it just exactly
[SPEAKER_03]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: He probably has fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think as these as this profit
margin continues to shrink and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: got these big monster grows, I think
you're going to continue to find it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be continued to be difficult for
these big businesses to find employees
[SPEAKER_01]: that want to do that shit, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, where are you getting skilled
workers from in this marketplace?
[SPEAKER_03]: And my my buddy, dude, he jokes that like
it's like a fucking factory job.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're in there and the lights are on
and the fans are running and the decibels
[SPEAKER_03]: are loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you honestly should have like
protective glass glasses and some and
[SPEAKER_03]: some, you know, and some earmuffs and some
good team.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's actually pretty fun because now
you don't have to man it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to be the guy like growing
weed for yourself is being that guy that's
[SPEAKER_01]: playing the the he's got the whole
contraption on the plane like six fucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's what the run in operating the
whole business is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some people, that's the right way
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to control your product
and your market and your marketplace,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these big monster grows, especially
when the ownership has no soul or passion
[SPEAKER_01]: for the plant and doesn't want to fund any
kind of fun shit for their employees to do
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't think you're going to find a
lot of people that want to continue to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that job long term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's there's an aspect to where
and I want to say it before I forget.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when he was talking about quality,
the other thing that I would say that is
[SPEAKER_03]: actually going to lead to like the next
generation of like real elites is if
[SPEAKER_03]: people want to breed, stop breeding for
the market, because that's going to change
[SPEAKER_03]: soon anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Start breeding weed that you personally
think is fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to find weed that you and your friends
love to smoke and you love the buzz and
[SPEAKER_03]: you love things about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow better weed for yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: The chances of that weed becoming popular
is way better than you trying to create
[SPEAKER_03]: something that you think will be popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow weed you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: My only business card and everybody that
knows me is a box of jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I show up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a box of jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can because I can tell you
pretty much everything about a grower from
[SPEAKER_01]: a box of jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you could.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be able to.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and there and there's an aspect
to where it's it's I mean, we haven't even
[SPEAKER_03]: talked about like if it went federally
legal, like the international market and
[SPEAKER_03]: how that would play.
[SPEAKER_03]: Into all this different stuff,
you know, because in each new in each new
[SPEAKER_03]: state that goes legal, there's a bunch of
investment money hoping to like dominate
[SPEAKER_03]: and make a bunch of money back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of been swinging around the
country right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in New York and New Jersey because
those are huge places that are coming
[SPEAKER_03]: online.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all these people are super excited
about trying to, you know, do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Washington, where he he's up,
you know, Washington and Oregon were ahead
[SPEAKER_03]: of California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we didn't really learn any lessons.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we just we just would shit the bed
right away or just like, oh, let's just
[SPEAKER_03]: make a bunch of terrible rules right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Destined for failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, that's that may only make
sense for California with how we do stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I mean, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say in all honesty, it's hard
because, like he said, this is it's
[SPEAKER_03]: agricultural, which has its own weird shit
to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a multi, multi, multi billion
dollar industry already.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not like they get to create the
industry from the ground up and like
[SPEAKER_03]: tinker with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to bring this huge thing
into the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have no idea how to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What other thing have they ever done that
with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: What have they ever done?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's why that's why some of
this money is so excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's eight million pot smokers in my
state already.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a huge customer base.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most things you make that are brand new,
you have to build popularity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weed is super fucking popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's already popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and no one controls it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all tempting for the money to be
like, I want to control that.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think Colorado probably was
falling out for Kelly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Oregon, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was just like I've been going
through having to delete all my old
[SPEAKER_01]: photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: To keep my shit from getting my account
deleted and everything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, man, I was I was like seeing
memes I was making in like 2017 18 when
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody was talking about the sky is
falling and shit in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, this is just reality for an
agricultural crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not prepared for it and for
being flexible with how you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: operate your business, it's not going to
be it's not going to be a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I will say, too, and I never
really thought that I would see this,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's an aspect where like maybe for
the first time, like being an actual weed
[SPEAKER_03]: nerd who really loves it as an advantage,
because then at least you get to love what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're doing, where a lot of people got
into this because it was easy or because
[SPEAKER_03]: it was money or because there was a big
margin or because, you know, it allowed
[SPEAKER_03]: them travel freedom or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as as it gets harder and harder,
they don't actually like doing what
[SPEAKER_03]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they get a lot more frustrated as the
market changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is just another joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just, you know, and they used
to make a lot more for a lot less effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they're making a lot less for a
lot more effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know where and there's not there's an
aspect that I see in Mendo all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably see it up there, too,
in Oregon, you know, where it's like a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of people that didn't really care
about weed, but learned enough to make
[SPEAKER_03]: money and run some big shit and make good
money for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that it's going legal, they think they
have this like lifetime of knowledge about
[SPEAKER_03]: weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they really farmed most of it out and
they were in it for loot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're really not that talented at
what they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really don't have the same knowledge
base as like people that were nerdy about
[SPEAKER_03]: weed and kept wanting to learn about what
they were into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's an aspect out there where,
you know, like being being like into weed
[SPEAKER_03]: helps because it's going to get rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to get rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: The combo did go sideways, but sometimes
that's what's cool about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we could have talked about hash
plants for the last hour, I suppose,
[SPEAKER_03]: in sequential order.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, man, who fucking cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking joints here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck do you guys want?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you fucking bothering us for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, to bring it back to hash plants or
whatever, probably in the probably in the
[SPEAKER_03]: last five or six years, as people started
measuring returns on on on plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: people started making hash seriously for
the first time in America on a commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: scale and trying to figure out what
cultivars and actually breeding for hash,
[SPEAKER_03]: which really wasn't done in the 80s,
90s, 2000s.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody really people were breeding for
flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the most part, you know, people
weren't breeding for hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, frozen hash, which is, you know,
arguably some of the tastiest hash for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they didn't have the gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Americans like it easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have like a village that we can
just be like, all right, for the next 12
[SPEAKER_03]: hours, all you families, you're you're
like bashing weed over a screen with no
[SPEAKER_03]: with no mask.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you watch some of those you
watch, you watch some of those some of
[SPEAKER_03]: those videos of what those guys do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know how they don't have an
allergy attack like every day of their
[SPEAKER_03]: life because they're just in a fucking
hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many?
[SPEAKER_01]: They be all shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, allergies moved out and did
something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they had to leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had to leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are desensitized people because it's
just a dust cloud you're working in all
[SPEAKER_03]: day long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't deal with this, you're living
in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the same thing is true, too,
where it's like there's a big push where
[SPEAKER_03]: like a lot of the popular hash strains,
they probably get popular because they
[SPEAKER_03]: yield great, not because they're the best
higher flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's always that pressure,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the money versus quality pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one was one of the best hash plants
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hybrids from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Sam bred the ship for making hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a resin farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he made the money that he made by
breeding a plant for 97 percent THC in the
[SPEAKER_01]: trichome head and then selling that as
technology to GW Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's that's his that's his claim to
fame right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like the only one that's done
that even.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did that shit back in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, that it's an impressive
feat.
Regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something every breeder should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But made a lot of, you know, the netter
hash and everything else that became
[SPEAKER_01]: popular now is the water hash market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we were talking we were talking to
Kamara a while ago and he was talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about how he's never even seen Sam smoke
flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: That he, you know, he breeds he's a resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what he called him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a resin farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't think he does.
[SPEAKER_03]: He likes to breed for resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what he's after.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what he's interested in.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what he cares about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's pretty dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my bubble man doesn't smoke flour
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of the same mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I consider sour diesel
diesel family to basically be like
[SPEAKER_03]: America's modern skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, that very skunkoid,
you know, type type, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: plant type aromas, all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still a little different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely not skunk one,
but it's definitely like it's in that
[SPEAKER_03]: family.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's modern skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even just chem family stuff in
general is I would almost say is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah, big tall running colas on
a lot of the hybrids a little bit longer
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering hybrid plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, synonymous with,
you know, good quality and commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only women and slaves smoke flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of my favorite quotes ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really funny quote.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really funny story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's when Sam Skunkman was in
Afghanistan looking for seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: He asked some of the muhajideen for flour
because he wanted the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy looked at him and was like
only women and slaves smoke flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Men smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was basically like, are you a woman
or a slave?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had to explain that he wanted the
seeds from the flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had no interest in the flour to smoke
whatsoever, but he wanted to make his own
[SPEAKER_03]: hash at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he wanted the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that made sense to the dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he was literally like women and slaves
smoke flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Men smoke hashish.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I handed him a pair of chains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, culturally they're very different,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's an unprocessed product,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And shit, I mean, if you just grow a field
of seed plants and randomly pick a flour
[SPEAKER_01]: to smoke, it's probably not the greatest
experience.
No.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if the flour wasn't ever bred
for smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like one of the things about sativas is at
least, you know, they were breeding for
[SPEAKER_03]: the flour itself to be smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one thing I find interesting that
everybody, you always see that comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a misconception in cannabis
breeding is that, oh, just go back to land
[SPEAKER_01]: race and it'll fix whatever problem
someone's talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, all these things are hermy
nowadays because of this and this and
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should just go back to the land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And make something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, if you've ever grown lots
of land race varieties, sativa,
[SPEAKER_01]: indica, everything in between,
I've grown tons of seeds from all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guaranteed, the vast majority of them
have equal or higher amounts of
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphroditism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, the plants when you grow
them from seed and the flour seedless,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it has those little tiny black like
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll like roll a joint up and it's
like all these little black specks on the
[SPEAKER_01]: table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've looked at them under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, I mean, it literally, it sounds like
you have spider mites in your,
[SPEAKER_01]: in your flower, but it's, I mean,
they're, they're tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are really common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know the rostas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiny trichome heads or tiny trichome heads
and tiny calyxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, or bracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the majority of what's in the
populations is those type of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the rest of them can be really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them, it smells good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is potent when you smoke it,
but the flower itself is just not
[SPEAKER_01]: desirable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has lots of growth problems as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Landrace is like whipping yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely setting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely a lot of pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's turning back the clock and,
and then you, if you, if you think that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the way to fix a population or
something like that, it's basically you
[SPEAKER_01]: assuming that, Hey, I'm going to turn back
the clock 50 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to do this myself from
scratch and do a better job than all the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that have done it between me and
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, dude, we're just lucky that
there was a decent population of plants
[SPEAKER_01]: for all of us to start with in the first
place, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like the goal is to at least make
hybrids and select for plants that'll
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to increase that quality so that
the next person that does that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that again, will continue to improve
the population better than you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's inadvertently how we've
gotten to where we are with all the her,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the feminized pollinate, accidental
feminized pollination that gives us our
[SPEAKER_01]: main breeding population of today is
because it was always the best plants
[SPEAKER_01]: cross with the best plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause no one kept anything else for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gotten this question a few times,
so I'll ask it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up with your Malawi?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the sourcing on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That came from the glass scene up here in
Washington, but by way of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anything about who pot the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, or how it got here or anything
super, super like land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, uh, uh, obsolete used it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, um, I think Caleb had it at one point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, um, shot 707 seed bank had it for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ran it from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was, it was one of those plants
that had a really strong, like hazy aroma
[SPEAKER_01]: when you smoke the flower.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody said more like Eugene gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know when they were talking about
Malawi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that was another name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone called it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, we talked earlier about like.
[SPEAKER_02]: The weird Instagram stuff and everything
that's been going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, one thing we're trying to put together
that I was going to talk about tonight
[SPEAKER_02]: real quick before we're done is that we're
trying to put together the breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: syndicate social.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know like, I think Fletch,
you saw Flanbell's social thing he was
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to put together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to use that similar type
platform so we can have a nerd IG for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll figure it out, but I wanted to at
least get that out there today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people have an idea to look for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, anything you're dropping St. Fletch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, maybe I don't know, but I'm not going
to plug shit on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just talking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool as fuck, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, not so.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, I, I, we obviously had a
pretty wide ranging conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, I had a Malawi.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's the same one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, how long did, did yours take forever
to finish?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like 90, 80, 90 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had this one and I never could get it
to, I needed to like depth it starting in
[SPEAKER_03]: June, you know, and, uh, and, and I never
did that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I grew it inside a few times and it
took twice as long as everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the hard part about having sativas
is you kind of need their own unique space
[SPEAKER_03]: for their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because otherwise you can't like
clean and reset and read it, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you've just got this like, okay,
now I have three plants that are fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: forever in a day from being done.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, check out readers to get
Patreon, go to Google, type it in,
[SPEAKER_02]: come hang out with us on discord.
[SPEAKER_02]: We shoot the shit all the time and,
uh, thanks a lot for coming and hanging
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was super cool.
