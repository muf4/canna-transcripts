[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, how's everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to live feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally got Instagram and YouTube up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks because I have to use two whole
different things and keep switching back
[SPEAKER_00]: and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you guys hear any sound?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any sound?
[SPEAKER_00]: Connection good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I start jumping into this like last
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of you guys can give me some feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Party is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Party wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only know about the DC muscle wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about no party wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you Google that, Google it at your own
risk and don't do it at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, welcome everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I was going to talk about some
breeders that you should check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people spend a lot of time asking
about fucking dumbasses and people that
[SPEAKER_00]: really haven't earned their place in the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: By earning, I mean just by being good
people, knowing what they're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, able to fucking have a decent
conversation about breeding, what we all
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of hope for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally you spend a lot of time talking
about that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I wanted to spend time talking
about people who deserve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, let me get my little black book
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I want to start off with some
housekeeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure to join our Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you have, some of you haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: On our Patreon, we have our discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main part of the Patreon that
most people utilize, but you also get
[SPEAKER_00]: discounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a 10% discount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're also part of Speakeasy's
Patreon, you get 20% at both stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it stacks up and adds up really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't just get my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also get other people who are the
homies on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I'm posting a lot of the
Nordalites progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: The progress working with Nordalites are
about a foot tall right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's going to be cloned and
flipped pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's some of the most beautiful broadleaf
stuff I've ever seen in the NL5 and
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not seeing a lot of narrowleaf anything in
any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, but when there are fights,
you know, I watch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes if you're cool, maybe you
can watch them with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a part of our Patreon discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really, really makes it worth stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we have special events and
movies and all kinds of stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't been doing them lately,
but we're going to start doing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I do some, or I'm going to start
doing some breeding posts, just little
[SPEAKER_00]: lectures, written lectures, stuff you can
take back to your homies and sound super
[SPEAKER_00]: smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I'm just regurgitating it
because I'm not smart at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sound is a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the sound a mess for everyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the sound a mess?
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab some bloopers for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering how many before I hit the
skunky phenom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how it really works.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any kind of genetic equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be the last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constantly lag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys good there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sound good over on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't have any different thing I
can switch to for a connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crash in the stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_00]: One second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to sign out the YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's probably the goddamn computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, over on YouTube, I got to sign
it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connection is unstable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know how to sign it out in
stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on a second, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can't even go grab the stuff that
has my internet thing on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So YouTube is just fucked for tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it for YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried with YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can come back over here if they
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube, YouTube epically failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the internet connection really
fucking sucked and it's been really bad on
[SPEAKER_00]: my computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I just fucked for YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it doing okay on here so far or is it
choppy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the last time the sound cut out and
that was even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to do it beforehand, but YouTube
doesn't really let you not go live and
[SPEAKER_00]: just test it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so we're going to be talking about
breeders that you should like,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: People that you should go support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is more important than ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not on YouTube anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anybody that asked about YouTube,
can you guys keep them on it and help me
[SPEAKER_00]: out with that so that I don't have to keep
going saying it's not on YouTube anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully people will jump on over here
for YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube is such a better platform,
but this computer has been not running so
[SPEAKER_00]: smooth with its internet connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so it's more important than ever
now to support the people that matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have to use your money like
swords.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: These shirts are real nice and nice and
comfy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to use your money like swords.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of bad folk in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now that pie has gotten very,
very, very teensy because of corporate
[SPEAKER_00]: assholes and corporate fucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want cheaper weed that aren't
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gypsy, I'm going to slap you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vote with your dollars.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is Prop 64 passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all knew that was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was only a matter of time until the
market crashed and it crashed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It crashed hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just for seeds, but for weed in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think now that the unemployment has
stopped running in California and
[SPEAKER_00]: nationwide, as far as the extra payments
that people are getting during COVID,
[SPEAKER_00]: no one's spending any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do not want to see your favorite
mom and pop shops sink, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: support these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of these people I'm not even
necessarily friends with, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: still the people that helped build this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about that shit in my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you worry about that fucking shit in
my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have nothing in my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so of course I'm going to start
with a lot of the homies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, CSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: CSI Humble makes some of the best shit on
earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first guys to really do heavy,
heavy feminizing in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: along with OG Rascal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got Archive, 707 Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy, High and Lonesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got Founding Father's Genetics,
which is with CSI's, one of his best
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and a friend of mine, Tygaard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody loves Gene, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can vouch for him because I know that
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that dude's heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worky Man's been doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: CB's been doing great with the Giesel
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodie has saved my career more times than
I can count.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the honest truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I've been down and out, when I've had
whole mother rooms just fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the one who really came and swung
in both times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elite Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt from Elite Cannabis has done some
amazing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He rarely sells it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully he will be selling it soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, hopefully, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Thunderfudge.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a homie and he's always done cool
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Melting Pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw him come in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been doing some great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radical Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get talked about a lot,
but they've been around a long,
[SPEAKER_00]: long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenomenal work, especially with CBD
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk Vier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk Vier's the homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a fucking really, really,
really cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people know him because of the Chem
91 cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: His mentor was where the Virginia Super
Skunk King from that is in Sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Bodie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know really well, so I can't
comment on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know a lot of people that I'm listing
are not friends with him.
Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swamp Boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't forget the Swamp Boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just two classic dudes that have
been in it forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Top Dog got his account taken down,
so try to give him a follow on Top Dog
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unreal how many people are just
ratting each other's accounts out just
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's how tight the competition
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm concerned it'll be much worse than
that over the next coming few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Freeborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, Gene's up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bloom Zico with hairy palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the homie Pip.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has his stuff over on Speakeasy as
well, so check out his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that they have some Neon Flamingo,
Purple Midnight, and Shock Collar,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are all KBG seeds, so go check those
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But any of you guys have any questions
about any... Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rich that made Dog Walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dog Walker OG, the other Dog Walker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heroes of the Farm as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of Clear Boaty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's Clear Boaty?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a Clear Boaty?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a Red Boaty?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doc D's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crockett Family can suck a dick,
but Doc D's a good one, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doc D's a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of the people I mentioned,
if you have any questions about him,
[SPEAKER_00]: one eye, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always call him Rich, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBF has made amazing shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a lot of my career to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same as Organ Kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what I've been able to do has
been because of guys like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get enough shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already talked about Cry Baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions on any of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynasty, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned Relic, but Dynasty's a part of
Relic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relic is Dynasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really pissed off at this fucking
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle Chronics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, great dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's tried to be super friendly and
helpful, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone, you just named Arctic or a bunch
of cunts, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get along with Brandon from 3rd Gen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the clounchy things always get to
be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was funny, but like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been cool to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already did Archive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us about the PBOG mail?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did it pass on reliably in the
crosses?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you like about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it compare to the blue bonnet
mail?
[SPEAKER_00]: When picking that mail, what I wanted to
do with most banana OGs, which you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to find is it out-crosses a lot of
amazing banana type stuff and OG stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it then shits out a lot of boof,
like a lot of skunk one type stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blando.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type stuff that probably came from the
Sega or Mathes 6040.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to improve that aspect of the
breeding with it and keep it more to
[SPEAKER_00]: higher resin production and keeping the
banana tones more dominant because yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube is down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to read and answer questions and
do all this right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so that was the difference in
just the banana OG versus banana OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube is down.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube is down.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the bonnet, I mean, it's two
different, it's two different,
[SPEAKER_00]: whole different projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't just choose a mail based on
one set of characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jaws is a fucking puto.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who, I'm going to give you a pass
UFO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you a pass, but don't
type fucking scammers in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get the boot guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how that works because people
think if I don't say anything that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking vouching for it because people are
stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't start putting fucking scammers in
here or you'll just be removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to remove anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just look for one set of
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or one look for a mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I choose a mail based on what I want to
create.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also choose its partners based
on what I want to accomplish as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it should always be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should always be that way with anyone
making anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason I did the banana was because
I wanted to, I love, I loved a banana OG
[SPEAKER_00]: growing up and I've made a lot of cool
shit with this, especially the platinum
[SPEAKER_00]: banana OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: My boy, Hugo, fuck yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the name that he really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: He handed me off that cut and it was
called platinum banana when I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't my name for it, but yeah,
I always had a love affair with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon kid was always super cool to me
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought it would be a cool project to
just banana up everything and see where it
[SPEAKER_00]: went.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have all the plants in the room
during the last platinum banana OG BX1
[SPEAKER_00]: mail thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually ended up doing a platinum
banana OG BX2 to the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kept back-crossing to the mail as
opposed to back-crossing to the female,
[SPEAKER_00]: which isn't done very often, but that was
to see how we bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he bred very consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a certain look that he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of where you can see
that look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Denali put up pictures of the
platinum alien orange cookies somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: and that has the distinct look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all of those came out looking like
what the mail passes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with the blue bonnet, my main
intention was to find a male that would
[SPEAKER_00]: bring the blueberry turps, not decrease
resin production and not decrease potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you guys, as some of you know,
that have worked a blueberry a lot or
[SPEAKER_00]: grown a lot of blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something you see very much of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like blueberry doesn't tend to
add potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry itself isn't a super resinous
plant when you compare it to modern day
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very fortunate that the first
male that I ended up using from the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: bonnet did all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some, um, his structure,
you can kind of see has, has a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of, um, he can pass on a little bit of Fox
tailing if, if there's too much light or
[SPEAKER_00]: too much heat, but most of it is like a
nipple type bud top and tons of resin
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's mostly Afghani as opposed to
what most people think of as blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa stuff, blueberry sativa stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, Jax?
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, with the blueberry sativa stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I actually, I thought most of this
time that what I was looking for was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be in the blueberry sativa stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, blue moonshine, blue velvet,
moonshine rocket fuel, all the other ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were popping at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I ended up finding was pretty
amazing stuff in the Afghani end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, that was because the Lone
Star's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets all the credit for that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opshole, another good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad someone brought him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, sub Rob, he's another bad ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get enough cred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smokin' some white body.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you liking it, Huey?
[SPEAKER_00]: How you liking it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Alien sour apple that you've had in the
ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you wanted to hear me say what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, let's see what I missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, how many blue bonnet did you pop to
find a male?
[SPEAKER_00]: I popped the 10 pack that I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't think I'd find anything in that,
but during the blueberry hunt,
[SPEAKER_00]: we popped several hundred seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several hundred seeds were popped of
different blueberry lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flow blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we had just gotten done with the rose
flow selections right before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, God, different, lots of different
blueberry, like from different people,
[SPEAKER_00]: different F-gens and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a wild, lucky, lucky, lucky pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only reason I picked that male as
opposed to the others was because he kept
[SPEAKER_00]: raising his hands up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even in veg, as he was growing up,
you know, plants pray when they're happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one just was, his families would be
like this, almost 90 degrees, just
[SPEAKER_00]: parallel to the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be like, is that motherfucker
raising his hands?
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet he's raising his hands for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, uh, that's really what I went
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something as easy as that, because in the
end, when you pick a male, unless you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you're used to a line and really,
really experienced with that specific
[SPEAKER_00]: line, it's all a shotgun method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you're never going to know how a male
truly breeds until he runs offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: My somewhere was there and you can see it
in offspring sometimes, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the purple stripe stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought he would actually pass a lot
more purple traits than he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can pass some purple traits,
but it's not like a main trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is usually from the Oregon purple
tight end of blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, do you usually BX does differ from
line to line?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends, um, at what generation
did you BX?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: For which?
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I only BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have a certain line that I really
like, and I want to use a male from that
[SPEAKER_00]: line, and I don't want to just reverse,
then I'll be X, but it's not my,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not a, I've done it a lot,
but it's not, it's not necessary all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time unless you're trying to get,
work a clone only line into male form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a perfect example would be Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Bubba BX to use as a male would be a
great breeding line or, uh, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: something else that's not available in
seed form, you know, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that male in, have to see some resin
pop out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, resin popping out of males is one of
those things that's, that's real debatable
[SPEAKER_00]: on whether it's showing intersex traits by
having a lot of resin or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, still on the fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring back face melt and clockwork orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we did face melt and that was
really popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some jackass stole the name,
stuck it on his lines and marketed in high
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just never, never thought to redo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you familiar with heirloom varieties
from Southern Appalachia?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not from that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unless you're from that area,
it's kind of hard to break into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that would be cool to know more about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a lot of clockwork orange work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we kept that line going and,
and tried to keep it mostly in stock,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was, it was a little hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I ended up passing it on and I
think Pride Baby works with it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's only so much I can do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's kind of like an art piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you, if you have a certain
character you draw and you get stuck in
[SPEAKER_00]: that character and it's hard to see
outside that character, sometimes it's
[SPEAKER_00]: best to pass it on to someone else to make
something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, mentioned that you like cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you like about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grew it, did you get actual
cherry turps?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did the high hit you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cherry pie, I got a lot of gas out of,
but I liked how he hit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave me in a similar anti-anxiety high
that I got from something like a
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry, but with a little more potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have complaints about
cherry pie because of the intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have a lot of problems with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I don't like flood nitrogen in
flour, which I think is one of the main
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, top three favorite blue bonnet
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, that's a hard one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one's going to be punchy bluster just
because the turps were so next level,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a, like, like a slurpee syrup types.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were, if you were vaping it,
you would actually taste blueberries with
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar and, and all that in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's very exceptional in that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, bubble berry was also an amazing
breeder and amazingly uniform,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, for being a simple one step hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to call an F1 because it was
not a, it was not a true F1, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, of one step hybrid, it offered a lot
of uniformity being that they were both
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat Afghani bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a third goddamn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blooper skunk is still up there,
um, because it's a great super skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: regular line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not necessarily because it was great
for letting the blue turps pass through,
[SPEAKER_00]: but because I love super skunk so much,
it seemed to be one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resin OG blue bonnet, the,
the Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross to the blue bonnet is, is gnarly
potent and it lets some of the berry come
[SPEAKER_00]: through, which a lot of the OGs didn't
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Louie blue bonnet also let those come
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, big red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I thought Bryn would be here to say
hi, but she just walked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run the bubble bonnet again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really want to dive into cherry AK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that cherry AK cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know CSI is using it in some of his
stuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water pipe is going to be so loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I can't wait to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else we do with the cherry AK stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We miss you too, red.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up straight box.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, can you guys hear that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting more headband phenos in
that matchup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, which one the banana headband?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's, it's, it's sticking mainly to
OG and headband styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like with the, um, the 56 day cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who was responsible for bringing the
cherry AK cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's what you're asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cherry AK cut I first found in San
Diego and I had seen other cherry AK cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: that weren't super resonance, but were
super purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there was a cherry liquor cut that
Nabu used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he hates anybody calling anything
cherry AK, even though his was the cherry
[SPEAKER_00]: liquor cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I never, never got to run his,
but it did make some amazing stuff in
[SPEAKER_00]: black Russian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, um, but yeah, first time I saw it was
in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never saw it after I left San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it happened to come across in a
two year long trade that it took for this
[SPEAKER_00]: person to follow through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of what he sent me was incorrect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, the one thing he did send correct
was that cherry AK cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had a friend in San Diego,
so he probably got in San Diego as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up with the rainbow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did never use it because he was still,
uh, a small boat was still doing stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't jump on it, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, I mean, it's, it's very much like
a really nice OGKB type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've done a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it was his project and
hopefully he'll bring it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many males would you test before
picking one for a project like blue
[SPEAKER_00]: bonnet?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean by test?
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran him out to see how he flowered out
for his general structure before we used
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but as far as hitting a line,
first you hit everything with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see if it works, you run the progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it all sucks on the next onto the next,
you know, that's how it always works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, usually if, if I don't find something
I like in the first two males,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'm not gonna, I'm not going to keep
pursuing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's a lot of lost money in that
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's with a project like blue bonnet,
literally that was all luck, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all work from Lone Star.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had very little to do with me or
anything I did special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't take much credit for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was already.
[SPEAKER_00]: A worked blue line from someone and rest
in peace Lone Star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can still find some of Lone Star
stuff as well from AKA Texas kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe he has some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know who else is putting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a cool line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Lone Star was putting it out at the
same time I was putting out my right at
[SPEAKER_00]: Barry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't give it a chance back then
because I was a shit head and I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thought like I had the best shit ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the best blueberry ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't need to see anybody else's
blueberries, but you know, I could have,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, done some magic shit just crossing
right Barry to it back then if they were
[SPEAKER_00]: both around at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharaoh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you got, what you got stray.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you, what you holding on.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what else I wanted to touch on too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run them, run them and use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What size container do you typically use
to Fino hunt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, look through for large numbers of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, usually if I'm looking through
large numbers of seeds, I don't go over
[SPEAKER_00]: half gallon and I pop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, fuck yeah, straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your most flavorful available with
a powerful effect now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Powerful is subjective because there are
certain things that like, um, Urkel,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, will hit me super hard
because of my brain chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas other people would like think it's
one of the weakest strains on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, that's objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: See flavorful right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, even the blue resin super flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some of the, um, banana OG stuff like
the sour apple platinum banana OG is
[SPEAKER_00]: really flavorful too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that that's still, I think
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, banana tie was super flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so much that I did in the blue
bonnet stuff that I'd love to list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the, the bubble berry V2 was super
flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost anything with the blue bonnet male
was super flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a specific, like you want
something gassy with very the way you do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, bring, bring these.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles is good shit for flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cherry berry, cherry berries,
super flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's from some of the
trippinoline in it that trippinoline makes
[SPEAKER_00]: everything more flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cross it out, outcross it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you cross the bonnet with any of your
strawberry stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not, but hopefully in the near
future, we can do some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be rereleasing any blue
bonnet stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't needed to rerelease much because
I have all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, there's some stuff that sold
out and some of those I plan on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what freebies came with the pink
and blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hit black triangle with two sky
cuddler males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also made a four sky cuddler, handing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I know who you are, but that's
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to be okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I answered that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next big seed drop in product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next big seed drop is going to be the,
um, Northern lights work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern lights works coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be open pollination of
the Hawaiian lights and the NL five.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all being documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're part of the Patreon,
you'll be able to see that and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, follow CSI humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some of his, um, Todd says
tri-chrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tri-chrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this, they're, they still need to be
cloned and flipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's no, we don't really rush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, not in a rush to get
anything to market like that, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: probably with the seed market now,
we should be rushing to do everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's not how you make good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, and this is for real, like everybody
in the, in our, in our industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: people making seeds, whatnot, pay really
close attention to, to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your mental health during this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's coming from someone who has,
you know, I'm a fucking shit show when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to mental stuff, but everyone needs
to be taken care of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's going to be tough times coming up
for all of us in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, and all you with passion take
care of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's going to be very fucking scary
and hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we've all kind of waited for that ball
to drop from, um, corporate shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to take extra work,
extra dedication to make it through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, why do you think everything
is going retro with the NL five?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was because at the time, uh,
Seattle Greg sent seeds to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: his son and Todd, and some people rushed
to pop like five seats and do something
[SPEAKER_00]: special with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it just happened to be the
timing on when Todd passed them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dog, man, what's up brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the, how's the, uh, the toy world
going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it, is it, is it crashing too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most of the other, other shit in the,
in the U S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the kind words Farrell.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up JB.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last time I let you guys see some
guitar stuff and because fucking I'm a man
[SPEAKER_00]: and men like show and tell them and do
that shit again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, show off some of my other pretty ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys already saw the blueberry Gibson
or the Les Paul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I'd show off a different one
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I don't need my fucking computer
since we're not doing any of that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hawaiian lights are looking good along
with the NL five Hawaiian lights is the
[SPEAKER_00]: back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NL five is, um, Steve Murphy,
Afghani times Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Hawaiian lights is a back cross to
the Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twizz are going wacky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resin supply chain is fucked.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prices went way up though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to sell some of my shit then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very special model.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of purple and this is a
purple Gibson Les Paul.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was only, uh, released in the robot
form, but as you can see, I don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: robot, uh, on it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought about putting them on just for
shits and gigs, but the robot,
[SPEAKER_00]: the robot shit sucked, which is this
button right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you tuned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was supposed to auto tune and all this
shit, but it really didn't do a great job
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, this one, when I got it,
it was on sale, um, on guitar center back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always wanted a purple Les Paul
that was a Gibson and I finally found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple is my favorite color too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ro the robot self tuners were kind of
fucking whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really love those ones,
but this is one of my babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my first Gibson I ever owned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I have another one that I'm rebuilding
before I can show it, but it's a,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, what is that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a Les Paul special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks, um, at double cut Les Paul
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks more like a Les Paul junior
kind of, but it has two humbuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll show you that my other baby,
the other one was a special gift from a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: My other was a special gift from a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not closing right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stupid fucking cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's KDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like my Gibson cases better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a junior that robot tuners put
grovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are grovers on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I want a real Les Paul junior
eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the fifties or sixties, but you know,
yeah, not anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but this one is a real special one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was given this guitar,
I, I had, uh, I had, I had stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really ever play at that time and
a friend and I just gone through some
[SPEAKER_00]: emotional shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a friend wanted me to start playing
guitar again and sent me this beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: American jazz master from the custom shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't marked custom shop, but this
person worked, uh, dirt farmer worked at
[SPEAKER_00]: the custom shop at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, yeah, it's a beautiful,
beautiful jazz master with some beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my favorite playing guitar,
especially for surf shit or even reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: It holds a fucking tune like nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I also have a few, um,
I have a Jaguar, uh, or Jaguar,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, a Jagstang that we're working on a
Mustang that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a few telecasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one specific telecaster is called
an FMT.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really beautiful and has
humbuckers, but it's like a, a flamed
[SPEAKER_00]: maple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually pretty cheap when they
sold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys can still get ahold of an
FMT cheap, they're so fucking worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when I got it, I bought the body by
itself and uh, picked up the pickups and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, no, I don't have any seven or
eight strings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can barely play the motherfucking
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need that many strings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a fucking really cool four
string.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a telecaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tenor telecaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that shit's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I'd be happy with four strings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't play no fucking metal solos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need no fucking extra strings.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, this one, this one was a,
it was just special because of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the gift factor of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone went way out of their way to give
me this beautiful, nice, very expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: custom shop jazz master.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was originally for blink 182 or it
was either angels and airway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was blink had ordered it and
they're just so rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have to go pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need that guitar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So went to Matt anyway, props to dirt or
dirt farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one of the nicest things anybody's
ever done for me really was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to shut this off because it's
fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really bad ass old mod fucking guitar
strap.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from couch couch guitar straps with
a fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I own so many of those just because the
quality got strapped blocks on that bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So break things because I like to break
things anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was one funny event that happened
today that I wasn't going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: share because you know, a lot of people
were on YouTube and they won't be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: see this if they're just on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that I'm just, I'm doing this,
let's see if we could put it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess at the MJ biz con, AKA the Chad
con, um, some people got in a fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some security guards started whooping ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the story behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully one of you got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could tell me cause that shit was
funny as fuck, but I do have the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I thought I put the other one away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show this one real quick too.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that didn't see it the first
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the SG blueberry burst modern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got like fucking clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think some of these pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got modern modern ways to a different
neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I love this guitar too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fast to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, if I sang, I'd probably play
for you guys, but I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll look dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me sitting here and playing guitar like a
fucking 15 year old, but I will show it
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will show it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can play punk and reggae and
that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 60s reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not, not like Bob later, Bob fucking steel
drum reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, back to the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me find this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that security guard was an absolute
moron for doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one slow ass punches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job security guard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do a gear night?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go through all my pickups and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of pickups and stuff I
haven't even put into the cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful black beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he starts fucking beating this dude's
ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The funny thing was this dude on the
ground that this guy is, is hidden for no
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right before he got sucked in the
face, he's like, Oh, knock this fool out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then got punched on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll play it one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the slow punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, totally missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's just clenching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to hip toss that big old dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to hip toss him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at him hip toss that fucking bulldog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch, he just throws him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, what?
What?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's all, fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just throws him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he starts walking this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude's like, stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knock your ass out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoop.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, this is the chat con.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at that lady yell, security.
[SPEAKER_00]: The security's beating the dude's ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, um, there was a fight earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: MJ Bizcon chat fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was fucking funny as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Play it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just played it twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have to, uh, rewind the show and
watch it when I put it up on YouTube or
[SPEAKER_00]: leave it up on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: First guy is Tony Vasquez.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who does he work for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know who are these people?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that right there, if you guys don't
use your money right, that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be what's left of this
motherfucking industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dumb ass motherfuckers like that who have
no business in our fucking industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not because they fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, whatever people are going to beat
each other's ass, but those are guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: some fucking chads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not like that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people are crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people are crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you guys say?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only 97 people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's worth doing a P 91
auction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's only a few packs of these left
of the originals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's worth doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll do something else though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't as expensive or I wouldn't be so
bombed if it doesn't go for a shitload of
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what do you guys say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Auction time or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you guys decide one auction off
the parrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's auction off the parrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: First big gets her first big gets a pair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look, I have some banana, banana split
blade here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone, someone just showed a picture of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I can find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I can find the banana split
blade picture here from modern day milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was had some pictures of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's looking pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to put those up somewhere sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I saved him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe these are them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could throw easily show all
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me find you some more pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose a different asset.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are all sold out everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been sold out for a long time,
but I did have some packs that I kept
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this is a good picture or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a great picture, but you get an
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, there's a lot of strawberry in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because a lot of people don't know
bubblegum smells are made up of strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: and banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually get really bubblegum and
smelling stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in our old, um, our old packs,
the brass knuckle packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, haven't, I haven't used these in a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so you guys want to, maybe I won't do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since there's only one pack of those left.
Um,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you guys want a bonnet or do you guys
want to do a banana OG line?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant a banana OG or a bonnet line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just, whatever you guys choose,
we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do 300 on, you want to do the
P 91?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting 300 on P 91, and then we'll
just wait like two minutes after the last
[SPEAKER_00]: bid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that gives everyone plenty of time to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is P 91 S 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who don't know what P 91
is, P 91 is an old, uh, cut from San Diego
[SPEAKER_00]: before OG Kush was big before,
you know, bubble was down there floating
[SPEAKER_00]: hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: P 91 was the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: P 91, hogs breath, cat piss, bull rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all flowing around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Godzuki, uh, Rob can name some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a fucking the San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: King.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the P 91 S 1 and, um,
lost this cut shortly after this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave it to Ken Arado and I think,
uh, Collie grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they ever did anything
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in such bad shape when I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason the guy gave it to me,
cause he didn't think he could save it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, P 91 S 1 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go, uh, mark that for 19 years.
Pin comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Betsy's another great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sister of bull rider or Betsy,
but this is the special, the special San
[SPEAKER_00]: Diego one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and if you miss out on this,
my homey bittersweet is going to be making
[SPEAKER_00]: some more, I believe of the either of the
S twos or even take it to S three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his S twos have been phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was going to pass anyone this line to
work like that, it would be him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm super stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took it on super stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, since it's a 300, I'm going to throw
in something special extra and some
[SPEAKER_00]: special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I saw something in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would make a good extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about cherry berry
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's throw in cherry berry on the extra P
91 again is an old, an old cut from San
[SPEAKER_00]: Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it's a super scout type,
but I think maybe some silver Pearl in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know some of the other San Diego
dudes think that that's a definite
[SPEAKER_00]: possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, a super skunk silver Pearl is,
uh, phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pick a P 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I have any on the phone
right now, so it really wouldn't do any
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me take this pick off though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people don't think that's what I'm
showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I'm going to throw in cherry berry
with this P 91 and it looks like four 19
[SPEAKER_00]: years is probably going to get it for 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the cherry berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll throw in something else for him
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's how we do
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of cherry berry backs in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, blue Gary, let's throw in the Louie 13
OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you bidding that local or are you just
asking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to pin your comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not bidding it, I'll throw in
the Louie, the 13th blue bonnet as well
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever wins smoked herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: King of Irene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, maybe I'll throw in some,
um, Colorado cough across the Platinum and
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something that you guys are into?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll wait on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody wants any cough
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want them in L five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody gives a fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know, five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three 66, 66 Matt Beeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I throw in some, some cough
Platinum banana?
[SPEAKER_00]: OG?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something you'd run for our 19
years?
[SPEAKER_00]: You get an opinion to Afghani or skunky
shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have blooper stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a big breeder's pack of blooper
skunk, a hundred seed pack that beaming
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The P is it's just one of those things
that he never got pumped anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never, he never got hyped outside of
San Diego or so cows and it, and it died
[SPEAKER_00]: out so hard, you know, that it just never
really got, it's just desserts outside of,
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, OG Kush really, really killed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got three packs of blooper skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to put the blooper skunk in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I do have the blue Gehrig,
which is the Louis the 13 blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cherry berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The punchy has been sold out for a while
and I didn't really ever sell that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used it to give away with some shit for
stupid ass BDSC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was all pretty much wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he popped a shit load of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never saw any of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, way to hold good to your word,
Isaac, fucking cough stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, tell it goes, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't trust people, especially in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: People suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lineage on blooper skunk is a diesel
across the blue bonnet and diesel is the
[SPEAKER_00]: mass super as one that super V2 tech for
being super technical, but it was the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the only P only mass super that people saw
outside of the VA super, which was a
[SPEAKER_00]: different cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously a different cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, just found some strawberry roadkill
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll throw in a pack of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the, uh, what was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: East coast sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the strawberry roadkill?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the strawberry switch blade or was
that the East coast?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see diesel, strawberry cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was more strawberry East
coast, sour diesel, strawberry cream
[SPEAKER_00]: across the blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Matt Beeman is going to win this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really been counting,
but let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get it, if you, if you want to be,
get it in because, uh, we're going to end
[SPEAKER_00]: it right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, not so as doing good, not so as
doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to, um, maybe do
something with Bodie very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the three of us, which would be,
I mean, we've been waiting for,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, a long time, a long time for a good
Bodie episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brento's fresh maker at 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clock starts again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is cult classic, cult classic doesn't even
grow, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be too mean on Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like Marcus, but I don't know if
he's grown in the past few years and I
[SPEAKER_00]: know other people were making the seeds
for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude's a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude is a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't even comment on that shit
because he is a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since Farmer Ho burnt you on the diesel
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to get my hands on some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking Farmer Ho.
[SPEAKER_00]: He thinks he knows some shit about some
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little dachshund bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Bodie and burner got something.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't, I don't want to say,
no, they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly doubt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up big worm?
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly doubt that.
[SPEAKER_00]: May I'm, Hey, things are weird in the
community right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if he wants to work with burner,
I ain't going to shit on it, but he's been
[SPEAKER_00]: around so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can do whatever the fuck you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I fucking have his back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have his back on anything because
that's my boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're at 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone had to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone had to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're at 440 Brento's fresh maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it's at 440, I'm going to put
something else in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I put in for the people that are
bidding to be enticed?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about some right berry V4?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be the, um,
what's it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: The mob cut across the blue bonnet,
which is just, this is just straight up
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry, straight up fucking blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this and the blueberry IX,
which was a DJ short blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those, those are the two tops for,
if you just want a pure blueberry line,
[SPEAKER_00]: a breeding blueberry line, uh,
nothing else but blueberry and some Mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: perps actually is in there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt beam in, ain't giving up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now we have the, the mob blue
bonnet, cherry berry, which is the cherry
[SPEAKER_00]: gay K blue bonnet, blue garg, Louis blue
bonnet, Louis 13th OG blue bonnet,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is one of the OGs that lets the
berry come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want a really super berry OG,
it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the P 91 S ones, one of the last
packs of those in existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people pop that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt Beeman at four six six six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for keeping the number pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody else have any questions while
we're doing this shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Counting down the minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if Matt Beeman is going to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local botanist comes in at four 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's getting a nickel and dime here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's winning a victory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being local.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four 80 for Brentos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it gets to five, I'll throw in some
else, something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: All kinds of weird shit in here that I
didn't remember I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought there was a breeder's pack of
the Trinity bonnet in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 50 pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookie Berry V3 too.
[SPEAKER_00]: 54 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right Berry V4, which is the mother of
Berry blue bonnet, cherry berry cherry AK
[SPEAKER_00]: blue bonnet, Louis OG blue bonnet,
Louis 13th OG blue bonnet and the P 91 S
[SPEAKER_00]: one, one of the very last packs of that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we're at four 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brentos is ruling the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruin that motherfucking game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to count down 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a bid, get it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, we're going to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local comes in at 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I got to throw some else in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookie Berry V3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one's.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not do a cookies one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to throw in the Trinity blue
bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Trinity cut that goes
around now is Trinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not been verified, but pretty much
everybody says that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one, but you know, I'm just I
like to be very oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be very specific, so unless it's
been verified by the actual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old Trinity Trinity crew out of Oregon,
then I'm not going to say it's it and half
[SPEAKER_00]: of them think it's it and half of them
don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, P 91 was special.
[SPEAKER_00]: See pink comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the the 50 pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is five packs of the Trinity blue
bonnet and not a lot of those are out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with the Riot Berry V4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the mother of Berry blue bonnet
mother of Berry is probably Mendo perps
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry cross to blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting basically a blueberry BX
with Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bringing in a lot of perps with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those who are chasing skunk,
Mendo perps is one of those places you can
[SPEAKER_00]: find skunky turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't know that you can
find them in Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them in in Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them in good old Afghanis,
but we got the cherry AK blue bonnet as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Louis the 13th OG blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trinity cross to blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trin Trin as according to my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Worm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a nickname he gave it and that's a
nickname I keep with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Trin Trin P 91 S1, which is the the
grand prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: See where we at 57.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it till 58 minutes on the on the
button.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the Mendo S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you're going to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you if you run enough of
those, you will find the skunky ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be some of the ugliest
because that tends to happen even with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Gzol and the Super skunks and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more skunky they are, usually the
uglier they are and the more prone to herm
[SPEAKER_00]: they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want those turps or thiols,
I should say, that's how you got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want those cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the proper term if you're a
real botanist, but I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just play one on TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor Urkel is really skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, Urkel, Urkel and like High and
Lonesome he did a dog waltz, the poodle
[SPEAKER_00]: nuts cut that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you do what's pee pee?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will I do a pee pee for Canada?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, I don't care where you're
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Canada and you can pay,
then yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, yeah, the poodle nuts cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you when you you take cuts of that
thing, it would be skunk smells
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so skunky and flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, PayPal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Canada, we can work something
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are all skunky ones all knobby and
leafy with dog tongues?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what super skunk looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brentos Freshmaker just came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brentos at $5.50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting your last bids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have success using S1s as mothers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Herming and potency relation just
expressions of hyper vigor or more likely
[SPEAKER_00]: to live?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hermaphroditic expressions could be all
kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: $5.55 for local botanists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hermaphroditic expressions could be all
kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the super skunk goes,
it just seems to be a what we call link
[SPEAKER_00]: trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Link trait to the thiols for whatever that
thiolic stuff tends to be quick to Herm
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to do well outdoor, but not a lot
of people want to be growing skunky stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor for many reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: ONYCD and Urkel would be a good
combination to bring some of that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that like Giesel and Sours
combined can also complement each other
[SPEAKER_00]: really well to bring that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's someone I didn't remember earlier
to list, but Boston Roots has been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: some amazing stuff for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always really impressed by his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always liking his pictures and
drooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: $5.75.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys gonna make me have more shit to
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do bitter chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do Pacific Northwest Hash Plant
across the blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the PNW Hash Plant across the blue
bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of these have been out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of people have seen these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditional old hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe the old original hash plant
that made the Sensi Hash Plant line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And $5.75.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonna call it soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is, this is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't had a good one pop off soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mind adding in all the packs
because it's, you know, what the fuck,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Money's tight for everyone right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might as well make it worth it for
everyone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your bids in, anybody else?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at $61.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marty.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to Denali reminding me,
this is Marty, which is why I called it
[SPEAKER_00]: Martin Short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know, DJ Short, Marty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Martin Short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sue me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once this hits 62 on my screen,
I'm calling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are bidding on a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts with the P91.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna ask one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: At $5.80.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody doesn't pay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that doesn't pay, it'll go to the
next bidder down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, keep a watch on your stuff,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep a watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me start taking some screenshots so I
remember who bid what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right under that one's that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right under that is, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've had people come in here and
bid last minute and just do it just to
[SPEAKER_00]: ruin options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Brentos is back in at $5.90.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Michigan THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Long time no see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I can wave at people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canapot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never forget you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never forget you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, gonna call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brentos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think old Brentos is gonna get this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is G13 and G13 Hashplant the same
cultivar?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, one is a hybrid of the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: G13 doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brentos, you are the winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brentos gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: PNW Hashplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cherry AK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Louis the 13th OG blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Riotberry V4, which is the mother of berry
blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a 50 pack of the Trinity blue
bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, P91S1 is one of the last
packs of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoy it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit me up after the live feed and we'll
square up.
[SPEAKER_00]: G13 is G13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so G13 died a while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see G13 pure ever cross to
anything other than Hashplant,
[SPEAKER_00]: Haze, NL2, Skunk 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's one more, but I'm
forgetting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashplant, Haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: NL2, Skunk 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be one more, but if you see it
cross to anything other of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything other than those four,
it's not real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: 88 don't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it shouldn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no 1988 G13 Hashplant,
but there is an old pack that Swampy had
[SPEAKER_00]: the Indian guy made his name off of that
was a G13 Hashplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it do with the cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's up in the air, but as far
as anybody knew, it was killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jill might have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there are people interested in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be nice to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, until we're sure,
we don't really, we can't really say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not Indian guy stuff, El Totago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Swampy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swampy passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indian guy was his friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indian guy was responsible for passing it
to a very few people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it was Swampy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, when people die and other
people pass it around, people's names get
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure I took a screenshot of that for
Brentos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Brentos and everyone else who
bid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Groups from G13, Skunk from Shanty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what's funny is Shanty also sells
G13 Widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of our big like points at
contention was on his forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, how the fuck did you get a G13
Widow?
[SPEAKER_00]: G13 was dead by that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up getting banned from the
forum for a while for asking that
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer was that it's really G13 Skunk
One across to White Widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, you know, people are
going to sell short names.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to do all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody's a fucking nerd like me and
my boys are when it comes to names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's Swampy?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's way before my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, even Indian guys before my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swampy was just another dude on Overgrow
and Canada's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he made the free Leonard, which is the
G13 Hash Plant butterscotch Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was the one who F genned the G13
Hash Plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Indian guy gave it out to some
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some more people F genned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very nice line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff Bodhi did with it was probably
my favorite by far.
[SPEAKER_00]: By far.
[SPEAKER_00]: The G13 Hash Plant stuff Bodhi did was
fucking phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a killer male, I think that he
called Deadly G.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might have been the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, he did some phenomenal shit with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your testing protocol?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many testers do you run of a new
release?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I'll run 10 to 20, whatever
someone's going to whatever normal person
[SPEAKER_00]: would pack or pop from a pack is what I'll
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll run a lot of different strains
because I make a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll run through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mostly do all the testing in-house with
the Blue Bonnet stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did in-house and out of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of other people were testing it
along along the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually most of the years it's been me
testing it myself because there's nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: more important than a breeder knowing what
he's got in front of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really don't know what kind of male
you have unless you're doing it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You too, Tent Flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freelander is still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes and no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that for a while BC Bud Depot
ripped off the strain and called it the
[SPEAKER_00]: big for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they never sell the same thing twice
as the same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Butterscotch Hawaiian is still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And G13 Hash Plant is still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would imagine that it could be
remade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the same obviously as Swampy intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could be made to be something
similar at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: The butterscotch Hawaiian seems to be very
consistent for breeding butterscotchy
[SPEAKER_00]: turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: When making seeds it's a good idea to
start a male into flower a week or two
[SPEAKER_00]: before the donor plants flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm doing regular seeds I'll flower
them at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm reversing seeds that's a big
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm reversing I'll usually stagger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some at one week before trigger for the
rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some I'll do two weeks at trigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some I'll do three.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of hemp I learned,
at least with the hemp lines I was
[SPEAKER_00]: working, you trigger them at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just instantly reverses so well and so
fast that you don't have to stagger the
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a couple males I recall correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was a little too dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first was Deadly G.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never mind your wife is snoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you stress test before breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do a lot of stress testing because
I think that people should grow weed
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if something is showing any kind of
hermaphroditic traits in a normally good
[SPEAKER_00]: grown room then there's a fucking problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Crush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh the orange dreams are so old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you kept them in a fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really old line.
[SPEAKER_00]: How old was the Orange Crush?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you said oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole line was 2007?
[SPEAKER_00]: 2006?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really old line.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
What?
[SPEAKER_01]: She was going to try to give me a toupee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a red toupee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't notice anything consistent like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah it's just shit in shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's with reg seeds, fem seeds,
hash, the better quality parents the
[SPEAKER_00]: better quality results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminization doesn't make things be any
more hermaphroditic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make any things be more
stretchy or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just everything is very dependent on
what you choose specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles is apparently what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Grapefruit?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say it's a green sherb S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jodry sherb S1?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what the the consensus is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you recommend for your cancer
treatment symptoms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that is more on the indica side
that will help you with your appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what people normally consider sativa is
help my appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you think that Afghani because
everybody has a different brain chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Afghani's are what help your you know
whatever is going on with your nausea in
[SPEAKER_00]: your in your appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff like my Pacific Northwest hash plant
lube on it does great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The silver pearl blue bonnet would
probably do the nausea thing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know silver pearl helped brain a lot and
that's a that is a hearty strong indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember throw growing the orange
crush was that a cross of California
[SPEAKER_00]: orange?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes it was a it was an old cut of Cali
orange crossed a blueberry and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my favorite orange strain ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah it would have probably been the same
one that you would have seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was there was a main orange crush
going around a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: NCGA used it a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Jojo used it a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had it down in San Diego and James Hogg
used it a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah shit was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're breeding for a THCBD variety or
THCBG variety would you use a hemp male or
[SPEAKER_00]: female?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay let me think in my head if I have a
specific project.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was breeding for more CBD than THC I
would probably first start with the female
[SPEAKER_00]: as the hemp and and a strong THC plant as
the male and see how that went.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not there's no certain specific
surefire way to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics depend on it's so plant specific
that there's no surefire way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's how I would start it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dreamsicle I believe that was the name for
orange cream sickle was the orange dream
[SPEAKER_00]: sandstorm that we made back in the day
when we crossed that orange dream line to
[SPEAKER_00]: sandstorm it was called orange dream
sickle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I'm a total nerd on names when it
comes to names I you know and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: history of lines and provenance and
getting sourcing stuff from actual
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders and then checking to see if that
breeder even knows what the fuck they're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about checking to see if they
understood pollen contamination or pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean and that affects all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That affects all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen control is a damn bitch and if
you're not super careful it will affect
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah yeah that's it's important to know
how was it made what was it made in was it
[SPEAKER_00]: a tent did you clean your tent between X Y
and Z you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my biggest warning on the on the
McCormick stuff the Northern Light stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the fuck was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot the flashlight is a taser.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a stun gun yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought you just fucking shocked
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good Lord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Woman's playing with a stun gun over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it's a flashlight and if you push it
the wrong direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean she did that just to fuck with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah sure you did that shit to fuck with
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: No I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wanted to jumpstart my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fat I can't have you do that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeder Syndicate podcasts have been a
gold mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well good dude I'm glad you enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna we're gonna be doing some more
very very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expect more from Breeder Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already have some in the can and
hopefully there's a lot going on like with
[SPEAKER_00]: with trying to get the right side up the
spray site going and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have that edited soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We interviewed Legend Seed Company Red and
Chimera and it was it was one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chimera add him to the list too of amazing
fucking breeders that have done amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of the biggest wealth of
knowledge that I've ever met when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to science when it comes to old lions.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's as much of a dork as I am on this
stuff so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Red as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red's been there done that when it comes
to the BC stuff and it was an absolute
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking honored to interview those two
dudes and I know they've been waiting for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to bring it all to you
because it was really that fucking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you tell me about bubblegum that
Sigarmatha used and Sirius Seeds bubblegum
[SPEAKER_00]: is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the Indians Indiana being more
indica but Sirius says their bubblegum is
[SPEAKER_00]: more sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe Adam Dunn tried to go over
that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to do a bubblegum show with
all the bubblegum guys but my friend never
[SPEAKER_00]: got back to me on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was going to set it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if we'll ever get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Indiana bubblegum cut that's over here
is from Sirius Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a selection from the year that
Sirius Seeds won the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that said there was I know a lot of
people had a lot of there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: phenos in it and people didn't always find
some amazing stuff in it that was super
[SPEAKER_00]: bubblegummy but that cut is phenomenal for
bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_00]: However it's not super bubblegum tasting
and I think that personally I think you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to add in some turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if any of you guys see CSI's Durbin
cross to the Indiana bubblegum grab it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I heard him say it comes from
Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam fucking dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't even come from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what the fuck he's talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: On one of the shows he had all the guys on
and he couldn't bullshit that Illinois
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy's a douche bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know whatever sells for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless him for doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be cool to have like the
bubblegum guys all sit down and and we can
[SPEAKER_00]: we can talk to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really put the story together in one
place that people can trust because they
[SPEAKER_00]: know how much of a stickler we all for
that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But heavy turpentine with bubblegum will
give you bubblegum flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happened with the SensiStar 95
SensiStar bubblegum pheno that came out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Superstar from Delta 9 labs which was what
Ed Bor got as testers from Luke or I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry from Simon early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was he got that from Simon early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took it to more sativa direction and in
there was the the I used to call it
[SPEAKER_00]: menthol bubblegum but it really it's it's
turpentine bubblegum and it just made
[SPEAKER_00]: everything taste super pink bubblegummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so turpentine helps carry some
flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why a lot of people like the
trademark Chad with the turpentine and
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boggs was the real deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I don't know what Bogg used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the the the sour bubble was a sour
diesel bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is not bubblegum but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What strain have you made that has very
citrusy turps and hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh I did a lot of orange stuff over the
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really been fucking with orange
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of the orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh there was there wasn't orange in the
blue bonnet stuff that did have citrusy
[SPEAKER_00]: turps but also had OG type turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really took it in a different
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big fan of tangy stuff for I'm
not a big fan of tangy stuff for any
[SPEAKER_00]: orange turps because to me it also smells
like like spaghetti sauce and fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hogs Breath is still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had nothing to do with TH seeds at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never had Hogs Breath or the real Hogs
Breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was our old crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jimbo passed it to his sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cut after after he passed the sister
and brother-in-law got it and they've
[SPEAKER_00]: passed it to a few people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was tightly held in a crew for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did not pass it for Jim's
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now like some other people have it
like Mad Farter has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brandon Russ has nothing to do with
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop plant based.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fucking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fucking around with that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude has nothing to do with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That motherfucker's a toothless tweaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ain't nobody trusts that motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a little kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a little kid and he's a toothless
tweaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does he think he had anything to do
with fucking anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe people would even buy
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original Hogs is still down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know enough about Boggs bubble gum
that he used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know the one in Sour Bubble was a
bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: You trolling my ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the wrinkle cut Agent Orange a goner?
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had a wrinkle cut of Agent Orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have one of Clockwork Orange which
was nothing related to Agent Orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a goner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a goner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been gone for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to get so mad when people would say
I should call it Agent Orange because I
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking couldn't fucking stand that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't stand some.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like oh not Agent Orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't call it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even an orange smelling strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was back when we used to call strains
by their hair color and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an orange haired strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an orange haired strain and it was
very golden when it cured so it just
[SPEAKER_00]: really made sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were talking about how their legs
would go numb when they smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that's kind of ultra violent,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Mad Farter's Urkel really as special as
people have made it sound?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mad Farter has nothing to do with Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never has.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a fucking Fresno dork.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always been a Fresno dork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel's from up in I want to say
Leightonville.
[SPEAKER_00]: He may have the same cut that all of us
have had over all the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean Urkel was in everybody's garden for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He may have that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying his cut's fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had nothing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us love Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not like Urkel to smoke but I like
Urkel to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it to breed because it makes some
beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some beautiful turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't smoke it because it gives me
anxiety and panic attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brandon Russ, I don't know what that dude
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to come in the live feeds and just
spit bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meth mouth fucking bullshit in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking what is he saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I made fucking Bull Rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't even know that he was talking
about fucking Afghani Bull Rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was trying to say that he made Afghani
Bull Rider but he didn't know Afghani Bull
[SPEAKER_00]: Rider and Bull Rider were different.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just so full of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I booted him out of the live feed and
now apparently some people are taking him
[SPEAKER_00]: seriously because Gene just put a stamp on
him or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene likes a lot of dorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Gene but Gene likes a lot of dorks
and I think that's how that shit happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't even say he likes dorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's nice to everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an asshole so I'm not nice to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not nice to everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's nice to everyone and wants to see
good in everyone and that's a good trait
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just don't have that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone's a fucking shitbag and I see
him live then I'm gonna fucking pop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: His grape vape just Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's closer to an Urkel hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty Urkel hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Favorite dosy crosses?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna be partial and say dos skittles
and dos bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my two favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chimera's most notable release?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say Mental Floss is one of his
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did the Highland Mexican Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had the Vision Thai Blueberry from
Vision Creator which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else did Chimera have that was great?
[SPEAKER_00]: Schnazzleberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fighting Buddha.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had all kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: C4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kalizar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude's been around forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully we will have Chimera back to
just to talk about some of his strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that he made but I'm sure he's gonna wait
till we actually have the other one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dose bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turp description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little bit of dosy dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little bit of Platinum Banana OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry I just do that all the time because
that's really the best answer anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: could give.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hogs Breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you tell me about that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of foot funky, cheesy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you could get some some fruity
turps out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was mostly known for its foot funky
almost cheesy type funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been a Williams Wonder
Cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jimbo told a lot of people a lot of
different things because he wanted to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it proprietary but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna say anything mean about old
flunk tech anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just a dipshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your top three sativas for strength and
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked Draw's chocolate tie stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potency, flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavor less so but for potency for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked the Colombian black that Brazilian
Zico had back in the day but don't trust
[SPEAKER_00]: them because he fucks everyone now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colombian gold that was in the
Colombian Chem D was really good and
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian Chem D was a great line too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the Durban stuff that CSI's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were Neville's dwarves made of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Magic?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's dwarves.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about his dwarves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're talking about Ruderales,
I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up Loosh?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up Mike Diesel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody else got anything else or are we
good?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Friday night I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Friday or is it Saturday?
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut out during this sativa recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the top three?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chocolate tie from Draw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian black from Brazilian Zico.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the third one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember now.
See?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dwarf sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember his dwarf sativas green
punk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talked to the dude a lot and fucking don't
remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it's very positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it didn't happen but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Wrecker.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up Bakdilene?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys want to see some Blue Wrecker?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really stoked to see all these
because this dude ran through I think four
[SPEAKER_00]: phenos that he ended up picking from
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some really beautiful pictures
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Blue Wrecker and he found most of the
ones that had a pretty good grading scale
[SPEAKER_00]: of purely original diesel dominant to very
blue bonnet dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really cool to see those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose a different asset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cool pictures in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the way this one looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me a lot of old like blueberry
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even like old-time moonshine hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that it was the LED light was very
very intense so he uh he was it caused
[SPEAKER_00]: some fox tailing in this pheno.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a beautiful phenom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love I love stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like you need looks personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what else we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really see the resin production
on it but some have had great resin
[SPEAKER_00]: production like the original diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The girth and thickness and density of the
original diesel and blue bonnet has a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of great density in resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But um yeah it was it was a mostly
original diesel is going to dominate most
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a super skunk probably with some OG
type in it like or maybe even Chem 91
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG type.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it tends to dominate the berry turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did get some with some berry turps
up in here for him so yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah um we do have some blue cheese left.
[SPEAKER_00]: The UK cheese blue bonnet which like if I
I that was one that I made the second
[SPEAKER_00]: round of the blue bonnet runs because
people had such a high demand for it that
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you don't like swerve.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude's a fucking cuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But could you tell me what you think of
his deadhead OG?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he buys seeds from other people
without them knowing in bulk and sells
[SPEAKER_00]: them as his own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So god knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it just depends on when you got it
from him what it would have been you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you ever do a grape ape blue bonnet?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had grape ape in the stable I know I
know CSI still has it in stable and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably Bode might.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: UK cheese blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the turps on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some hella hella cheesy
berry fucking beauties in there.
Beauties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what else we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose different assets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting new to this changing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They changed it up on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's a different one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a really weird like uneven
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I remember correctly this might
have been the most blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently running.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just moved so not running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about to start running a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time I've been down like totally
down in a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting restocked and about to start
running stuff again.

Humboldt at his location which is the NL5
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Hawaiian Lights.

[SPEAKER_00]: Blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that Texas resin company did.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shoreline cut that High and Lonesome
has and runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know maybe maybe expect to see
some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green ribbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about green ribbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was after I stopped paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sweet super skunk maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take on fat guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He seems like a really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean he's just trying to make his way
through the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's very respectful and nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have nothing bad to say about the
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't run his stuff.
