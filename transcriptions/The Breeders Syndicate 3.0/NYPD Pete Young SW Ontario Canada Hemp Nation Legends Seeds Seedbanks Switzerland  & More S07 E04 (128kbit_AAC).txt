[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeder Cynicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_02]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_02]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie
[SPEAKER_02]: Nazodon, Breeder and Grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_02]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll notice with a lot of our
interviews, it kind of just jumps into a
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation and this will be no
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ending will probably be no
different as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So apologies in advance.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of our conversations are all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bunch of us with ADHD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to put that in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, welcome to Breeder Cynicate
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here with my friend, Shawnee Kids and
Nazodon, and we are here with New York
[SPEAKER_02]: Peak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was the, I guess you would say owner,
runner of Compassion Clubs in the 90s in
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and we're still going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started the, originally it was called
the London Compassion Club back in 1995.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we went public in with Alan Rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would have been like 97 or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I split off from Hemp
Nation and did the Organic Traveler,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was my retail, but they call me NYPD
just because my name is Petey Pete and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: from New York kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, they don't call me New York
Pete, but they call me NYPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: NYPD, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always scared to lead with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I remember when the first time I
heard it, I was like, NYPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a bunch of fucking NYPD
paraphernalia, like the shirt and the hat
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But where we're from, you know,
it's like everyone had a nickname.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like my name is Shawnee Kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Pete has only really known me as
Shawnee Kids going back to the 90s,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of our friends had nicknames.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone had a nickname.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of had to in this industry
though, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because back in the day, I didn't want to
say, Hey fucking Sean fucking,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, or Chris Clay or fucking
anybody's real name.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're the king of shortening
words too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I fucking mixed up everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's evolutions of people's
nicknames that I know has a fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: nickname.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if something like Bongboy worked for
me for years, no idea what his fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: real name was.
[SPEAKER_01]: No fucking idea what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll admit that on my birth certificate,
it does not say not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tour names.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's a different nickname.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different way, you know,
for being in a semi shady, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: quasi what, you know, anywhere from
completely illegal to quasi legal to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to, to gray area to maybe, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always said, you know, we have,
we, I've always lived in the gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it's really dark gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it's really like gray,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I've, uh, I've had a deal
in the black market because I needed to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to suffice or to satisfy the need of the
medical communities that I was part of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't grow enough for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and that's really why I started
growing pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started growing pot, you know,
one, not to sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to save money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I started organic traveler,
uh, in a, you know, university town,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the, uh, grow your tuition campaign,
which was, uh, I would sell you seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: give you information, sell you grow
guides, come back, come in on any Sunday
[SPEAKER_01]: and we would have grow chats and,
um, walking through how to do cuttings or
[SPEAKER_01]: start seeds or stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because money in your pocket,
whether you save it or make it is still
[SPEAKER_01]: money in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't get into this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I fucking honestly, you know,
I, I won't work with anybody back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day, especially when cannabis was illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your sole income was strictly on
growing pot, good on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you're not going to be in my circle
because I think, you know, if you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that's kind of prostituting the,
uh, the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I've always been a good big
advocate about, you know, not prostituting
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant, like use it for what it's
meant for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was put forth for us to enjoy,
not to, you know, uh, basturize and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a prostitute kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've made my entire living off of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also had organic traveler,
which was a head shop that was legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I got busted, which I have and end up
in jail, which I have, and they take
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that I own, which they did,
my rent was still paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was still food on my table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before I had hemp nation or sorry,
organic traveler, or before hemp nation,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, hemp nation, I was, uh, delivering
meat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was fucking delivering meat every
morning from nine or eight in the morning
[SPEAKER_01]: till four in the afternoon, come home to
my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was my gravy, my fucking shady
fucking day job, put food on my table,
[SPEAKER_01]: paid my rent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all the gravy in life,
my $2,000 bike hanging on the wall,
[SPEAKER_01]: my trips to fucking Amsterdam or
California, wherever the fuck I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was all from the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, you know, and it's not from being,
you know, a Dick about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, uh, I grew pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have a harvest party and I'd bring
all the staff in from hemp nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be like, what do you guys want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to, I'm honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm charging you double what I charge
medical so I can sell it cheaper to the
[SPEAKER_01]: met for, to the people that need it over
the people that want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and you tell me what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will pay for it in time, but if you
want two ounces or three ounces or QP,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, I'm going to take the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put in one of those
containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to stick it in my deep freezer
and you come to me with a quarter ounce,
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring it, you know, but that pot is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not selling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody else could be a generational thing
too, because like when I, I felt like
[SPEAKER_00]: where I, you know, where I grew up,
at least it was really important to have
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of, um, verifiable income.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you had to have some reason of
existing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to have some way to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't want to go to court and they're
like, how do you support yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, uh, and you know,
it comes from an era where like you,
[SPEAKER_00]: it had to be a side gig because you know,
you need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it was just a, even if it was just
a front, like you said, like you had no
[SPEAKER_01]: organic traveler was all a front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, I fucking never made money
at organic travel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it got to a point of losing about 40
grand a year, I said, okay, we're pulling
[SPEAKER_01]: the plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by that time, you know, I was doing
the compassion society for like 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cops knew what I was doing,
you know, and then, you know, in diva.
[SPEAKER_01]: Came into play and diva came in into play
as I was closing organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I, I same thing CRA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a reason and you, you kinda need to
have, um, a reason for, like you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: what people see, but for me it's for what
I see and what I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I cut ties with some really fucking
great growers and, uh, and I cut ties with
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just fucking ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people would just say, shit,
you guys are fucking assholes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just, um, their focus was
money, money, money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you chase it, you know,
you're opening yourself up to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're more vulnerable to be taken
advantage of or get busted, or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, get shady, deal with shady
people, shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been pretty lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've been in this industry,
um, fuck long time, 30, how old am I 30,
[SPEAKER_01]: 40, 40, almost about 35 years,
you know, that I, that I put my name out
[SPEAKER_01]: there and said, Hey, I'm a fucking pot guy
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: London is a pretty conservative place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was totally different than like,
that's why most people went to BC because
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody left BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I say.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be like, Oh, BC grows the best pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're from Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, fuck, you know, like I went out to
BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived out there and I didn't meet
anybody from fucking BC kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm out there on grow contracts,
but you know, it was what we have here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it seems like it, it kind of,
I think the marijuana movement started
[SPEAKER_01]: around here and we are in a very
conservative town.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back when I started, we had a very
conservative religious mayor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I wanted to make a point
and I put up big banners that said the
[SPEAKER_01]: Lord believes in marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you believe in the Lord?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it was not, it was not
something that she took kindly,
[SPEAKER_01]: but would not, you know, make a stink
about it because she would be giving me
[SPEAKER_01]: airplay, but more o'clock in the morning,
the fucking paddy wagon showed up and took
[SPEAKER_01]: down my fucking banner.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you've been doing this a long time
and all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like the one thing you've been doing
also is like fighting the law openly,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like since what, since 93?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like, I think it was when the
constitutional challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I still talk with Alan young,
uh, on a regular basis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's, uh, that poor man's been beat
the shit up in this fucking industry too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is he?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Alan young is the, uh, I say the
cannabis lawyer in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, um, and so he's the one that
handled Chris's case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, his partner, Paul Bernstein,
he handled like Ross robo roll a big
[SPEAKER_01]: doobie, whatever the fuck his name is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to the West coast, you have John
Conroy.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you hear constitutional lawyers,
uh, you're dealing with Alan.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, do you want to explain the
whole, uh, Chris clay arrest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I was part of hemp BC,
but in the shadows, uh, luckily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first time we got rated,
uh, um, it was, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with, with Chris, very educated,
well-read, polite kid who didn't start
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking pot till just a few years prior,
um, read the law and the law, the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: the law was read is it wasn't cannabis
that was illegal was THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So THC is not in the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started selling seeds and that's how I
met them because I was going back and
[SPEAKER_01]: forth from New York to St. Thomas or
London, cause I was in college and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing seeds back and forth,
just trading for genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was helping him with the little,
uh, great Canadian Emporium seed fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he realized, well, cuttings don't
have fucking THC in them either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he took out a fucking full page ad in
the, uh, see, I think it was scene
[SPEAKER_01]: magazine that said, uh, overgrow your
government.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I'm pretty sure that Chris,
while we would have been Andrew,
[SPEAKER_01]: who was the artist, coined that phrase,
don't overgrow, overgrow your government,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's all grow the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, it was literally a
cartoon of a seed marching with a helmet
[SPEAKER_01]: on with the hemp nation flag on it,
holding a bong at like, it's a gun and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, and we said, we're going to sell 30
skunk one cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: For 30 bucks or 25 or 25 bucks or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I think by the seventh cutting or
something along that line, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jordan, who's the little person,
I think is a proper name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Howard the duck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was Howard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he, uh, I just reconnected with him
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's back in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so they read, he was the one that
actually sold the cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: To an undercover cop.
[SPEAKER_01]: They must've brought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Howard the duck sold the cutting to an
undercover cop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Chris was arrested because he was the
owner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was his name on the lease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, Jordan got arrested because he
was the actual one that did the,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and, uh, and yes, they must've
bought the cutting and then brought it
[SPEAKER_01]: down because they didn't buy it and then
bust them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bought it and then came back.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Chris would be the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was smoking a lot of pot back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris was smoking a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had dreadlocks actually back then too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, and they all did Jordan had
Jordan was like a little person,
[SPEAKER_03]: but he had dreads down to his ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had like a lip thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he was, yeah, he was,
uh, he was, uh, it still trips me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Howard the duck, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was only Howard for like a very split.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He tried to remove a lot of it because he
was, he was underage.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the documentary on it the other day
on the making of Howard the duck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't mention him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They mentioned, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They talked about how like they hired him
and he was a little kid and how like they,
[SPEAKER_02]: they initially shot a bunch of it with
him, but the movements they have removed a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of the dummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had to move it, remove them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but he's in hell if it was him or
not, because you know, if you can you
[SPEAKER_01]: actually email me that, uh, yeah,
yeah, definitely kind of it's way worth
[SPEAKER_01]: watching.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was in something modern too,
with like Colin Farrell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and Bruce is a great movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's him.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Jordan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hate to say, but I, and I joke with
him too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, listen, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of all look alike kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's so many people that times
I'm like, fuck, I'm pretty sure that's
[SPEAKER_01]: Jordan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I don't know if it's not,
I have to go look at the fucking credits.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, oh, it's not him.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, it's just,
um, and then Prozac back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, which was another one of the kind of,
um, I wouldn't call him a Klingon because
[SPEAKER_01]: he was part of the, he was hemp nation
family, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and, uh, you know, obviously Pete
rocks was and Pete Miller and I can,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, uh, there was a whole, and,
uh, there was a whole bunch of,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, whole bunch of us, but anyways,
getting back to the bus.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they must've took the plant out,
brought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't analyze it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just maybe confirmed that it was
cannabis and came back later that
[SPEAKER_01]: afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And raided the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't take any of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't say anything about the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Busted them for a paraphernalia,
paraphernalia, the two six 2.2 and the,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and for the, uh, distribution of,
uh, controlled substance or like back to
[SPEAKER_01]: heck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be called something different
back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if he was a PPT, like the,
uh, possession for the purpose,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, anyways, they, you know,
cleared out the store or fucking made a
[SPEAKER_01]: mess of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically try to shut them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, maybe they didn't realize Chris
had really supportive parents that had
[SPEAKER_01]: money and believe their son not to be a
fucking criminal, like he was treated and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and the Elmwood house, we had a grow
house on Elmwood that everybody lived in
[SPEAKER_01]: except for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I actually, I was delivering meat at
the time and, um, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they went there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where they busted Prozac and,
uh, his girlfriend at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that was fucking a shit show of
craziness because as soon as the cops
[SPEAKER_01]: busted us, the phone calls started going,
everybody that was at the house was
[SPEAKER_01]: literally like running in the basement,
grabbing pots, running out the backyard,
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing them over the back fence into an
empty lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time the police got there,
there was literally a trail of dirt up the
[SPEAKER_01]: stairs through the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out the back door and dirt still on the
top of the fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were just like, they were like,
yeah, not on the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not our problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so, um, so that, that was the
first bust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then since they didn't say anything
about the seeds, Chris and Chris and I,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris and I got a little bit more serious
about it and started to, um, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: get a little bit more into the breeding,
buying, like I say, showing those,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these early, uh, sent to seed
packs and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that was coming over there,
maila seeds, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: When did we start buying seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you, did you tell me that you were
the first in, in Canada?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think Canada, I think Chris was the
first, uh, seed company in Canada because
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know of anybody else that was
publicly selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, way before dark enemy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, more, uh, Mike up north, Mark,
yeah, Mark Henry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dark enemy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark enemy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, yeah, they, they removed the whole
chapter from my book because they were so
[SPEAKER_01]: scared that he was going to sue me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of thing, but he's a fucking
douchebag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, um, Mike up north at
crosstown, he was early in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't think Dom ever, no,
Dom never got into the seed thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, out west.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nobody really out west that we
knew of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, hemp BC wasn't even around at this
point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as I knew, yeah, it's Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris was the first one to stick his
fucking little neck out there to,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, to, to spread the word, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like to overgrow the argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and when they busted him the
first time they, uh, they didn't even know
[SPEAKER_01]: he didn't do anything about the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we figured fuck, you know, we,
we, we know where the limits are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's balls to the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into the seed fucking business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start spreading the seeds fucking
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and we started, that's when I
was hired to work in the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I, every Sunday I would do,
um, cultivation, uh, counseling,
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever the fuck they wanted to call it
with NYPD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and, um, it was a, uh,
it was the point that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we started getting noticed and we would
start getting people traveling to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Chris got on the internet and
everything back then was raw code and
[SPEAKER_01]: started producing the, uh, seed menu
online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was fucking, we were getting more
hits at one point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I remember correctly, he said we were
getting more hits than university of
[SPEAKER_01]: Western Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we had so many fucking people that
just heard what you can buy cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, because we were in the
newspaper, sure, they're going to put that
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gives us credibility of who we are
and what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, when they came back the
second time, they offered Chris a,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, a, uh, a way out an option is yeah,
to, to, um, plead guilty to lesser charges
[SPEAKER_01]: and drop the constitutional challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and basically sell the seed,
sell the pipe, sell the bonds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't care about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and Chris came to us and said,
it's up to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, we're, we're a nation at this
point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were true.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were treating ourselves as a nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we had minister, I was minister of
agriculture, and then we had minister of
[SPEAKER_01]: labor, which was Bill that took care of
all the retail store and all the,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, uh, all the staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had minister of education,
which was Sarah, and she took care of the
[SPEAKER_01]: library and the museum and, uh,
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Andrew was the minister of
defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was our artist, but he was the
angriest.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was, he just, he was, he's a brilliant,
he's a school teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was scared to share with me now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his wife owns from Mars, which is
another staple in this town.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, so we was set up as a
nation kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were ready to, like, they call it as
war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were going to take it as a war on
drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a war.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we formed our nation and we were ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, and this is like early twenties
kids, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're all like in your early
twenties, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in the nineties still.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be the late nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were, uh, um, yeah, it would have
been like mid nineties second time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I opened up, uh, organic in 97
and, um, and we were, our, and Chris was
[SPEAKER_01]: already banished from Ontario by that
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing was, is after the first
raid, like I said, we went balls to wall
[SPEAKER_01]: to the, with the seed in the seed
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when we started again,
if you're going through Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_01]: sell it, send a seed so I can breed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was doing what, um, what the fuck's
the big douche bag and, uh, Amsterdam are
[SPEAKER_01]: you on?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, he's, he's a nice douche bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's an arrogant douche bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so many, no, yeah, but he's the most,
this is the most famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: He threatened to Sue us as legends for
when we were entering the cup with the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, he thought we were.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Neville was always, uh, good people,
but we were using Neville seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Hank is the type of fucking guy that
started doing what we were doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, but being a Dick about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, I would openly say, Hey,
listen, we got in 20 seeds of skunk one
[SPEAKER_01]: from, uh, from the drunkers and I'm open
breeding those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the same room, we had an original
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a black Domina.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had all these other strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're F ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get when there's no
guarantees here, but you get your grown
[SPEAKER_01]: pot, you know, now you're officially a pot
grower and, uh, they're, they're good
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics and not, you know, from where I
started my genetic, uh, selection was from
[SPEAKER_01]: bags of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd get fucking in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not getting the fucking best weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting fucking Jamaican brick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I first started, we were buying
nickel bags in East Rockaway on B 15,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I think is actually in a,
in a beastie boy song, but, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: for five bucks for a nickel bag and 10
bucks for a dime bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would get, you know, a third of it
was seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was back when it was after people were
saying, uh, buying it by the lid,
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like four fingers in a fucking in
a, in a sandwich bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were basically going and buying
nickel bags for five bucks and you would
[SPEAKER_01]: get a shit load of seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it was good pot, I would save the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't know what the fuck it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what sativa was or Indica
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's all fucking Jamaican fucking
shit weed or Colombian or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we got certain things and people
like, Oh, it's acapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm going to keep the fucking seeds
because I've heard that back in the high
[SPEAKER_01]: reading in high times magazines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started collecting those genetics and
I would bring them up to Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would trade with, uh, with Chris,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would have his seeds from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: London is a fucking phenomenal place for
cannabis for multiple reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, because we did have the Perth County
conspiracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a lot of the draft Dodgers that
came to Canada, um, didn't want to go too
[SPEAKER_01]: far north and we're right between Buffalo
and Detroit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the, uh, geographic,
we are surrounded by Great Lakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are a glacial runoff that all the
minerals and everything got deposited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our soil here, that's why we're such a
large farming community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our soil is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since we were getting all that,
uh, and we're all grown pot in the fields,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the fucking, uh, in the corn,
you know, we were growing some great
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you got seeds in it, which you
would indefinitely, uh, get something,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was happy as fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: People like piss off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Oh man, it's got season.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, fucking give me this.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a score, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me smell the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it worth keeping?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, give me some descriptions,
grow it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, see if I could grow it indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, if it came from around here,
I knew I can grow it most likely grow it
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors because there wasn't very many
people growing back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they were, they were used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using phototrons and fluorescent lightings
and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We w the HID community really wasn't
taking off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it was in the nineties, in the early
nineties, I was having some local kids go
[SPEAKER_01]: and steal fucking lights from in front of
buildings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they were, they were street lights
or something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were metal halides and HP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were either 400s, most likely all
400.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all do too many thousand watts back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like two fifties and four hundreds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were, we were trying to,
um, we were growing pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, we were fucking pot grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know what we were growing,
how we were growing it, but fuck man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it weed for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you do to it, the more you can
fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let it do its thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it food, give it water, give it air.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's going to give you, give you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, by, by bringing some of these
Jamaican strains from New York and which
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying Jamaican, which I think it's
going to be, it was, it was brick weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew most likely, I should say,
I didn't know back then, but I learned
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly that you can't grow indoors here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, but we can grow it indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, people didn't like it because it was
too big, too scraggly, too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if anything, they're growing up
here, especially all the pot that came
[SPEAKER_01]: from the, the sixties and the seventies or
sixties when the draft dodgers were
[SPEAKER_01]: coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the seventies, when their kids
were getting, you know, old enough or
[SPEAKER_01]: something that they were growing dad's
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just saw one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's called Elmwood and it's supposed
to be this ancient genetic that is
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to be fire for outdoor around
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get a lot of, um, uh, seeds,
you know, any more history on Elmwood or
[SPEAKER_01]: is that just basically, no, all I know is
I've wanted to see forever because I heard
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I knew was like, when you get to
Northern London, North London,
[SPEAKER_01]: Lucan, Exeter, you know, a little bit
further North, maybe not as far as,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, not as far as Owen sound, but maybe
kind of in that direction, South of
[SPEAKER_01]: Collingwood, Owen sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the plant that everybody grew
because it was massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, was it the, the, the best don't know,
but you know, we would have people that
[SPEAKER_01]: grew like this, this range called Berry
Berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Berry Berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, uh, and it was my first centerfold
in high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what, what's in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a fucking seed that a guy came
in and says, this is the fucking bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's, let's try it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grew it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, had to be like an F one,
uh, cause it was all over the place,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it would fucking turn into something
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, this is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we didn't have a fucking name for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They was like, guys tastes, smells like it
might be a blueberry size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm not calling it blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets the, uh, it gets the idea,
you know, like I was curious, when did you
[SPEAKER_03]: first start, uh, or when did you first
make contact with high times and start
[SPEAKER_03]: working with high times?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Kyle found me, um, Gushman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to put that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually sent him an email because he's
out and fucking the Oakster damn shit
[SPEAKER_01]: spreading the, uh, the, what does he call
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the plant chiropractics or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super cropping, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an article that's was the first
article and it was like a growers
[SPEAKER_01]: interview or whatever on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did make it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was shown by some growers in,
uh, in this area and I made sure it was in
[SPEAKER_01]: the article saying that, you know,
it's fucking phenomenal technique for
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are growing indoors that want
to grow certain strains, certain ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't want to have fucking 50 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have two plants, three plants and
still get two pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not, it's going to take a little
bit longer, but you know, certain strains
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously work better for it, but it's
manipulating and training plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, to grow in a, in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and so when Kyle came through,
so short, long story short, the other
[SPEAKER_01]: thing with him teaching this, I was like,
how'd you learn this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I want, I want, I don't want him to
acknowledge me, but I want him to
[SPEAKER_01]: acknowledge the lineage of the history of
this technique because people deserve,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the recognition and it doesn't say
their fucking names, but especially
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't talk to either of them
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one guy is the biggest dick in
this fucking town when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: anything in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he showed me this technique that
fucking got me recognized.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they flew me to the cannabis
cup to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just talk about Canadian
cultivation techniques and it was super
[SPEAKER_01]: cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they did the same thing with Soma
five years later or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so anyways, um, Kyle was living in
Detroit at the time and, um, he was coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from maybe Toronto or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, he must've heard about,
uh, either the seeds or me or,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear that beeping periodically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it like diabetic thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and, uh, he just popped in the
shop one day at organics and struck up the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation and we hit it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, he would come back and I
would, uh, him and his boys, we called the
[SPEAKER_01]: Detroit dangsters, uh, great growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Sally is still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big John, I think is gone, but,
um, that was, that was his crew,
[SPEAKER_01]: his boys, super good, super talented
growers in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, but they liked the fucking
Canadian pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the, they were coming through London
and I would invite them basic to,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was saying before the hemp nation
family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, listen, if you guys want,
you're paying 200 bucks an ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're paying us not Canadian,
you know, and, um, I was happy with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were fucking stole cause you know,
they're paying three, $400 an ounce in
[SPEAKER_01]: Detroit at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just said, you know, I'm selling to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do what the fuck you want with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have vac sealers back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just fucking, I was taking,
you know, freezer bags or taking Ziploc
[SPEAKER_01]: bags, throwing them in freezer bags and
then another freezer bag and then baking
[SPEAKER_01]: soda.
[SPEAKER_01]: But dryer sheets and then another fucking
Ziploc, you know, and the way that we got
[SPEAKER_01]: it across was they would have a friend
come across, go to Windsor to the casino
[SPEAKER_01]: and the boys would, like a guy would bring
his girlfriend, not tell her what was
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would go over the night for the
casinos, the boys, the dangsters were
[SPEAKER_01]: paying for all of it in our fucking,
if, you know, the, if they could stay the
[SPEAKER_01]: night, do whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, the boys, the boys would go there
with a key to the, uh, to the guy's trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't even fucking hide it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just fucking knuckle bag in the
fucking back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then would drive across the border
with nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the, uh, the next day they would,
the buddy would wake up, drive across,
[SPEAKER_01]: got all the paraphernalia from the fuck is
casino, spent the night, had dinner,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't buy anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't do anything to the casino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did that for fucking years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I found out just a few years ago
that, uh, when they were, uh, went across
[SPEAKER_01]: to come by, come back here, they were
asked if they were coming to see me by
[SPEAKER_01]: name or, and they were just like,
okay, like, yeah, he's like around,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like the, the winds are
crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming from Windsor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and now I had a, uh, a run in with the
Windsor border, coming back from a photo
[SPEAKER_01]: shoot, uh, four high times where I met
with Kyle, um, and the danksters and,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh God, another photographer fucking most,
I think the most famous, uh, photographer
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the nineties to early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was there doing, he was shooting also,
but anyways, I was meeting with Kyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I brought all my photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was right after I got back from
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had all my Swiss photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my Amsterdam photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I got, I got this in the early two
thousands then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you said I was in Switzerland in
2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Switzerland didn't really get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I was at the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I did the cup and no,
I did the cup quit smoking pot to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so when I, that's what I was
meeting, I would imagine that's what I was
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting Kyle for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I brought all my photos,
uh, which always meant pictures,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I just basically use as proofs and
then slides because that's what the
[SPEAKER_01]: magazine wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then video because I wanted to,
uh, document the shoots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they pulled me and I was driving,
my girlfriend at the time had a 1969
[SPEAKER_01]: Volkswagen bus and I had crazy dreads that
were probably just about my shoulder
[SPEAKER_01]: length, but they were still just finishing
developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were all over the fucking place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not crossing with anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely would never cross with any
fucking pot or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, got pulled over and they said,
you know, we were searching the vehicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I got a pot leaf on my fucking
shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, do you have any drugs on
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, listen, this, I tell you,
my name's Pete young.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from London, Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: I own organic traveler, which is a
marijuana fucking paraphernalia shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't make it any easier than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, no, I'm not, I'm dumb, not stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing illegal kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, they said, okay, well we're going
to search the vehicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make you stand out, stand in front.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I watched the guy go around to the
back and he's the younger custom agent and
[SPEAKER_01]: he holds up the first slide and you just
see his eyes go fucking this big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I bet he thought he found the mother
load.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, ah, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I walk around and I approached him and
said, Hey, listen, you know, not sure how
[SPEAKER_01]: the law is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of have an idea that you're allowed
to look through anything, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: people's likeness in these photos that I
do not have model releases for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So legally I can't show them to anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he explained, yes, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have absolutely no fucking rights
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we're allowed to look at every fucking
photo, every negative for pornographic
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, do you have any
pornographic material?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, fuck no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, it's all pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, it's me pot, my dog and pot,
me, my dog and pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, there might be a couple
titties, models that are holding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And stuff like that, but nothing
pornographic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, okay, I had not hundreds,
but thousands, if not maybe 10,000 photos
[SPEAKER_01]: negatives in that van because I brought
everything because that was the money cow
[SPEAKER_01]: for me for high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: They loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, and I didn't get paid for all the
pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it came into the grow America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause Kyle needed photos to put into grow
America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, okay, I'm going to donate this
many, but you're paying me for this man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I got a centerfold, I got 600
bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they got a full page, I got 300 bucks
and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it, uh, it made sense for me to do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, maybe that's, you know,
he opened up another box and literally
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of photos and he's looking at
them and it's like pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, you want to see some
really nice ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start pulling out pictures from,
from, uh, Switzerland, which is fields of
[SPEAKER_01]: pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just like a backyard full,
but a fucking hectares or yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, and he's like,
where's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, well, that's Switzerland,
somewhere in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, some are here, some are there
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never said they're from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never said they're from the States kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just opened up another box and he's
like, is it all pot?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like every single picture in here is
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, why do you have all this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily at the same weekend,
they were having the, one of their,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, big rave convention party kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget what they called it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a specific name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, I was coming back from
there and we set up a booth to show people
[SPEAKER_01]: to use cannabis because you don't have to
have it tested for fucking, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: bad drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had them at these, at these
concerts or at these parties where if you
[SPEAKER_01]: got a pill, they would go and they'd
scratch off a little bit of it and they
[SPEAKER_01]: would test it and say, yeah, it is MDMA
or.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, some, it's some speed or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would be able to tell you,
um, maybe not what's exactly in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they could more or less tell you
what's not in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just made up that bullshit literally
on the whim that I was coming from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had all the pictures that's just put
out on display to show the show kids not
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't fucking do drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking gave them one of my fucking
credit cards said, Hey, listen,
[SPEAKER_01]: I offer a 25% off any officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want them or you want to pipe a
bong, anything like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just show them your badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get fucking, you get discounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one of the techno festivals in
Detroit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, they were big back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I wasn't trying to interrupt or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the, one of the ways that we
used to regularly go into, into Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that, um, was we used to go like,
and especially in the Detroit scene with
[SPEAKER_00]: Windsor being right there, there was
parties that were thrown in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of border crossings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they learned like what hippies and
Ravers looked like, and they didn't like
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used to drive across the border.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wearing like dockers and polo
shirts and all normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of our like real clothes were like
stuffed in the trunk of what we normally
[SPEAKER_00]: looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we were trying to go back and forth
and look like the biggest nerds ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you, you know, if you looked a
certain way, you're going to get,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get checked out on a
certain level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just didn't have that option.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had fucking dreads and you know,
like I did the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, I'm driving a Volkswagen
bus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a pot leaf on my shirt and I got
fucking dreads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm born in New York and I live in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a passport for both.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't deny me wherever I go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm going to the States, no matter what
I look like, they can't deny me because
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm only using my Canadian, my U S
passport.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to come back to Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not telling them that I have a
passport for the States or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I show them the fucking Canadian passport.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't deny me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I look like somebody that you don't
want to let in your country, but I'm a
[SPEAKER_01]: citizen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have a choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know you're in the States now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, uh, you know, it, um,
you know, I have, uh, I have, I have,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an uncle that does the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has Brazilian citizenship and he's,
he's American as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he, he, when he goes into Brazil,
he uses a Brazilian when he comes back
[SPEAKER_00]: into the U S he uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like he never goes anywhere,
but he's constantly, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he just uses, you know, and so,
but yeah, I just, I just remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in the Windsor area,
cause Detroit was right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as, as the years and the nineties went
on, they definitely started, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I don't know if you want to like
what, what, you know, profiling,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, you know, had an image of
like what hippies looked like,
[SPEAKER_00]: or what herbs smugglers looked like,
or what Ravers looked like, or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what each week, one of these
groups was likely to have on them or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always, I always tell people that,
you know, I, I kind of followed a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: mathematical equation for lack of better
terms, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The police know that what to look for,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If, um, if you're in this industry,
so there's going to be, uh, 90% of our
[SPEAKER_01]: community is susceptible to getting busted
because of the way they look, the way they
[SPEAKER_01]: smell, the way they walk or talk,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 5% on either side.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 5% of the people in this, in the
movement or industry that never leave
[SPEAKER_01]: their house.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't go to the grow shop themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They send somebody to send somebody to go
buy the fertilizer, go buy their seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: go buy what they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that person, whoever purchased
this has no idea what, who the person is
[SPEAKER_01]: that place the order kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That person is never going to get busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, I mean, it's going to be very
unlikely that they get busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other 5% is where I fall in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stand on the street corner with a
fucking six foot pot leaf with my dreads
[SPEAKER_01]: out in my Volkswagen going, I'm a fucking
pot guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they know who I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 90% of the other people are out
there are susceptible to fill their quota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why the fuck do we want to drag in the
dreadlock?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's going to have the newspapers there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're like, we'll leave him alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made that 5% on the opposite side
because I literally had a six foot pot
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf in my front window.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally did have pot plants growing in
my front window.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a certain time, my whole front
window was full of fucking peyote in San
[SPEAKER_01]: Pedro's.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And didn't you also do stuff like call the
newspaper and they would run an article
[SPEAKER_03]: where you take them to like a cornfield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, that was a, that was a like CBC
and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought news agencies to my field,
my crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me throw out a question before I lose
the thread of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you met Kyle, did he have a
strawberry cough then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever hear any of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberry, the cough came out of
Connecticut, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So those boys, do you know who those guys
are?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I know of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, you know, this is another thing
with Hank douchebag.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the cough, they named it them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Kyle fucking said, you know,
it's makes them cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like strawberries, whatever the
fucking deal was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kyle was with HT at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he met the cough guys when I was still
hanging around with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never got to meet them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually, I had a warrant out for my
arrest in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wasn't going to go to Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: No reason to be hanging out in
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's no reason to go to fucking
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a speeding ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was 145 mile per hour speeding
ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never, I never went back and I was
like, you know, whatever, but he told me
[SPEAKER_01]: about it and it seemed like a great
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I had strawberry diesel and I was
like, what, what strawberry are they using
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, is it, did you give them
my strawberry by chance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, what, what, you know,
and I never really got down that,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I never went down that rabbit hole to
figure out what it was, but from what I
[SPEAKER_01]: understand, from what Kyle told me,
he's just like, they hit the money shot
[SPEAKER_01]: with a fucking, uh, with a plant that
produced this fucking fire pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what was in the strawberry
diesel you were running at the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, just because it was,
that was, it was brought to me as.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the cough itself did start in
Connecticut and I got introduced to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made its way out to Colorado through
people who went from Connecticut to
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Kyle has always been a little bit
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, he dances around origin
stories because it's like one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that, because he worked for high
times, he got pretty well known for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as he's tried to become like a
cannabis celebrity, some of the origin
[SPEAKER_00]: stories of the things that he's known for,
he's gotten pretty, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty vague.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, cause the fucking douchebag,
he sold the cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: To fucking Hank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why he's the strawberry cough seed
was produced is because fucking,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't know if the Connecticut boys
got even a piece of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because, and like when, when Kyle and
I, when I dissolved my friendship with him
[SPEAKER_01]: was we were in Amsterdam in the middle of
one of these squares, me fucking screaming
[SPEAKER_01]: at him about, uh, him backstabbing me kind
of thing over.
[SPEAKER_01]: The common story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just like, what the fuck is
wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, uh, you know, he's a fucking skinny
little Jewish kid from New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's from New York, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and I was like, I know you did it
to the cough boys, but you didn't know
[SPEAKER_01]: them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just some fucking kids that you
met that called you because they have some
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking great fucking pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got, um, Kyle got famous because of the
Kyle special blend fucking pitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the hell's the name of the
photographer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the names of the
photographers from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will remember for, for a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a super fucking nice guy,
super great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that pissed me off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, he tried to, um,
he tried to put like, I was finished my
[SPEAKER_01]: first tour in Switzerland and I was
contemplating if I should go back or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Steve is a hard person to fucking
work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want reds from this town,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, he, I didn't know him when he
lived here, but I met him through Steve
[SPEAKER_01]: before legends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know who I met first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I think, I don't know if I met,
I don't know who I met them all around the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were all out in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, red and chair, he called himself
Kermit for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we're brokers, uh, growers,
not, not breeding.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legends started in Switzerland,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it started with the, uh, the Louie
and, um, and that was just a, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a freak, um, thing that happened with the
Ortega.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, but so anyways, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thing is Steve, Steve's fucking
wick is fucking this fucking long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if he, if you, if he's pissed off,
like when we were in Amsterdam and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, oh God, why the fuck do I have to
start work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: My memory is fucked now, but, um,
Is this the fast spear story?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fast spear is my fucking story.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took my metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of my fast, fast fatty was a
strain that Hank threatened to Sue us
[SPEAKER_01]: over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he went back, Hank came through
Switzerland, saw, heard that we were going
[SPEAKER_01]: to enter all these strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, well, I worked on these
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went back to fucking Amsterdam and
registered all the fucking names.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we showed up he at the dinner
right before, uh, high times is all the,
[SPEAKER_01]: with all the people, he came up to our
table and said, Hey, listen, if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about entering these strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm going to Sue you unless you get,
and so red had to go up and make a side
[SPEAKER_01]: deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, okay, we're going to give you a
percentage, but the fucking douche bag,
[SPEAKER_01]: he wrote down fast fatty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought fast beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys hated fast beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking didn't want anything to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all Ortega.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all big fucking Indica freaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't fucking work in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, red did a little bit,
but I was there for fucking months.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, popper bear came out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sat in the fucking hammock, smoke joints
and fucking, you know, waited and thought
[SPEAKER_01]: he was the fucking, the king that we,
uh, we bred sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, strawberry blonde, um, the Louie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was, we just, basically we had
a, uh, we had 30, maybe 600 Watts in a
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainly we're just doing cuttings because
the company is called Mr. Hemp that Steve
[SPEAKER_01]: was working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just, it was right after they
got busted for the selling pot to a minor,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we still had the, uh, we still have
the facility in Lugano.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, we ended up, uh, just taking a
male and smacking it against the fan in
[SPEAKER_01]: the corner that it pollinated the whole,
like he couldn't barely see through the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so some of my seeds here
someplace called the blonde bastard and
[SPEAKER_01]: the blonde bastard was, uh, was a
strawberry blonde crossed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and they didn't want to do anything
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ended up, uh, keeping it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the, uh, strawberry blonde?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember what was in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: See, this is what I remember with Steve is
he, he had a whole bunch of strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: That were, were good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like, um, this here is, uh,
uh, big funk, which is one of his strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, the strawberry, uh,
sorry, the sweet tooth number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, Steve would be better to
understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think part of this is, um,
correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of it might be just my
interpretation of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I believe that he had a bunch of
strains that were, uh, or he had,
[SPEAKER_01]: he had one strain or he had a few strains
that he thought were fucking great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he found that fucking resonance
blueberry male.
[SPEAKER_01]: He crossed everything with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it was my understanding is when he got
the, um, the, the sweet pink grapefruit
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting in California, two cuttings came
up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vancouver Vic, who I'm pretty sure that's
the guy's name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure he was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't get the best reputation with the
boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one cut and Steve got one cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you talking about Dick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but I don't know who he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's no longer with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, I have a feeling, um,
Steve took that blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sweet and the, the, the sweet pink
grapefruit and crossed them and then grew
[SPEAKER_01]: out a bunch of those different seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one became sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: One became big, big treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: One became, you know, this one's called
big funk, but that's not his original
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big treat was one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, something, but I know I haven't seen
someplace, uh, I just don't know where the
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, I have a feeling that Steve
ended up with, um, a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_01]: phenos of that, those two strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what he started building his
catalog off of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, the sweet tooth,
which was one of his more favorite,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know he wanted to back cross it,
um, maybe to that same blueberry or to the
[SPEAKER_01]: grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of took different lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had the, uh, he had two different
shishka berries, uh, the red line,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, so I don't know,
you know, did that come from a dip?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that, you know, he was pretty famous
for growing these big, huge, long fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: spears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, shishka berries, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a picture of his wife holding them
and they're like fucking three feet long
[SPEAKER_01]: of just straight colas kind of that,
you know, and, um, I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I have a feeling that maybe the,
um, the seeds were all from the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, same crosses, but just different
phenotypes that he.
[SPEAKER_01]: Started creating new lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I think the sweet tooth and the
shishka berry were the ones that really
[SPEAKER_01]: stood out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the strawberry blonde, the big tree,
the plum bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plum bud that I just saw that it was,
uh, yeah, that was, uh, and I know I have
[SPEAKER_01]: that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have all these fucking seeds someplace,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm blind as shit though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see plum crossed a mighty might.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was West coast seeds, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plum bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It described it a little bit saying that
it smelled very fruity, but it didn't go
[SPEAKER_02]: into detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this Gabriella Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be able to see that collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you have some cool stuff in there
that I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it, cause I keep track of everything,
but I just write it down and not think
[SPEAKER_01]: about it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like this pungent skunk from
legends, right?
Like.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even fucking think we even sold
that strain, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just one of the genetics that,
you know, we grew out that we like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is from Khmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking stream cows, cows are colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call these ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, um, C four is like a Cali.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to see four.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't produce worth a shit,
but it fucking was a good train.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like Cali or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, you can't, if I even bring up
that name with Papa bear, forget about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a fucking, it's like with red and
Steve, you just can't mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those guys were brothers, like fucking
back here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Steve, like, did you know him
before you got invited to go to the Alps?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I knew him before then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, first time I did opium, I was in his
fucking at one of his places, fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: freaking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: In his hot tub.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I didn't know how the fuck I met him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was a pot guy here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He probably got out there through Hillary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and he, how did you get the invitation
to, to go to Switzerland?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve's a picky guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you had to have done something to
leave an impression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I remember you told me that fucking
guy paid me $2,100 a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: To fucking go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, and then it dropped down
to, and then fuck that Steve, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get paid that much fucking pot in
Switzerland as a Canadian.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, you know, Oh,
fucking the industry is not what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if I can, I'm, I brought
all the fucking, uh, pot to Amsterdam from
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland for the, for the cop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what kind of, you know, I'm a little
bent by it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I always have been, but they were
all Ortega.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were not wanting, they didn't want
anything to do with the fucking,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, um, fast beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was all fast beer because I was in the
field every day working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't smoke Ortega.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking, it would puddle me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would, uh, I was all about the
fucking night clean and the fast beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now these strains are all strains
from, uh, Neville.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: These street seeds came from, uh,
little Eddie douchebag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one, Eddie, Eddie, which one,
uh, like Dutchman?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nobody likes him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but, um, so the deal was he was hired
by Mr. Hemp at the same time that Steve
[SPEAKER_01]: was, and he brought all these seeds that
never owed him.
[SPEAKER_01]: The story was never old him, owed him a
bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead of paying him, he found a
fucking box of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the back of a freezer when he had to
jump ship and gave them to Ed as payment,
[SPEAKER_01]: partial payment, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those seeds ended up in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: They ended up in the field and we had,
that's where the Neville, that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: the, uh, the night queen, the fast batty,
fast beer or Neville's haze probably goes
[SPEAKER_02]: from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think, I don't think we had
Neville's haze in our field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never heard of, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's ever heard of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they were, they were, they were a
box that Neville sold to somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I meant to talk to Neville about this
before he passed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like five years ago,
six years ago, I had another, a new
[SPEAKER_01]: contact, um, through the Mr. Hemp seed
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I never got a chance to talk to
him about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want to ask him?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it was more about the history of this
box of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what year was the box of seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm not sure, but I could tell
you that they were still viable in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in, um, 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 99 probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the story was that, um, somebody
ordered these seeds, never picked them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they got forgotten about in the back of
the freezer when time came for him to thaw
[SPEAKER_01]: out the freezer for whatever reason,
he passed them on to Ed for again,
[SPEAKER_01]: what I was told for an outstanding debt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, Ed brought them to Switzerland
and Steve planted him and Steve planted
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Ed had a falling out with Peter,
with, with, with Mr. Hemp and he was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was brought in to replace him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, they actually even gave me his
phone number.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still had his phone when I got there,
which I think is one of the reasons why,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause it was still in his name and I was
calling Canada and all over the fucking,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sitting in a field in the middle of
the Swiss Alps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't particularly care for the guy
anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so that's what I, that's what I
heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you, uh, did you have any old,
um, early Pearl, early girl, silver Pearl
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the, back in the early days of
Sensei.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and they see, this is the other thing
that again, you know, we hear so many
[SPEAKER_01]: stories and, you know, regardless of who
the stories are from, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we went out to dinner with the drunkards a
few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, Sativa sisters, um, God,
Jesus, beautiful girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hell she's out of the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, she's still in the business a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the Amsterdam seed company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they were out of Canada though,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Karen was a blonde and then big tit
with the black gray hair that sold
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I forget her name.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's kind of still in the big tit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got big titties.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a Karen's partner in the
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's infamous out, out in the,
in the, in the, uh, seed industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were you going to say about the Pearl
and the, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back, back then, um, when it wasn't the
Sensei seed bank, it was just the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be where Neville sold his
stuff to Sensei.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would have been Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was a partnership between
Neville and Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, uh, that was after seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was, that's what brought
the end of the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was that's when Sensei seed
started.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, well, it wasn't the bus that,
that, uh, made Neville sell to,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the drunkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know that basically the story
almost, basically the story was told that
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville was the breeder for a Sensei seed
bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did breed for them for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but you know, it was all of his
genetics that he was breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when, when the first, um, catalogs were
coming out of the Sensei seed bank,
[SPEAKER_01]: you had early Pearl, you had silver Pearl
in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We loved it because again, we were dealing
with genetics that were, um, from Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like these were, these were the original
fucking strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, other than like the skunk
and the Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we were, um, Oh, I just had the
name too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, fuck that's damn it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's who?
[SPEAKER_01]: Entered the sweet tooth, um, before Steve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that gray area or someone?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it wasn't gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bluebird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bluebird Cafe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, who owned that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Katsu Bluebird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who owned that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck, I think it was Bluebird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should look it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, that's the one that Steve
tried to, was going to fire bomb because,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, we're talking about like Steve's
fucking temper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was Ariane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and Luke and everybody else that
was trying to, and the drunkards are
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to calm him down because they
entered, it wasn't Bluebird.
[SPEAKER_01]: They entered the can, they entered sweet
tooth in the cannabis cup and without
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve's knowledge or permission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was, it was a coffee shop
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, no, it was a C he, it was both.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a coffee shop see, but they were
also a seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arnie Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barney's farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barney's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Barney made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barney's sold, they still sell sweet
tooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was Barney's.
[SPEAKER_01]: But see the, the, the, uh, that guy's like
fucking from what we were told again,
[SPEAKER_01]: from the other guys, big fucking,
um, Netherlands mafia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like, you gotta tell them
Steve, you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go there, you know, he's going to
kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be fucking you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause Steve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is a big guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never seen him fight, but I wouldn't
want to see him fight because he would
[SPEAKER_01]: fight in a fucking heartbeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, so, um, but yeah,
fighting, fighting the mob is not like,
[SPEAKER_01]: he was going to go in there and literally
firebomb the fucking place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he was like fucking Gary sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so anyways, um, so again, this is,
I, again, we're, you know, we're,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're like fucking the elders,
uh, sitting in the teepee, trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: regurgitate stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we kind of go by what we're,
what we hear and what we're told kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us get to witness it firsthand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us hear it regurgitated once or
twice, and we never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I like with, like I say,
with those seats from, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this fast spear, this night queen,
you know, this fast fatty, these,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there was a whole bunch of other
fucking strangers.
[SPEAKER_01]: In there that, you know, I was,
I was told this story and it, it anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: that I reach out to and, and hear pieces
from, they kind of connect a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of sound similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So about them being seeds from Neville and
stuff like that, for the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: most stuff was based on his.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that Neville mentions a
bunch is that it seems like 90% of what he
[SPEAKER_00]: made, he never released in the sense that
he had strains that he liked that got put
[SPEAKER_00]: on the catalogs, but he'd make hybrids of
all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only a tiny percentage of those things
ever got offered up an actual sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't, um, we wouldn't, uh,
breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't breed anything without somebody
else's permission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless it was a publicly, you know,
um, uh, available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody can buy seats from like,
you know, I would breathe and not think
[SPEAKER_01]: about now with Luke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't do that because, you know,
he's very particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and he's, he was small and same as,
uh, um, you know, so the small one,
[SPEAKER_01]: same as Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I wouldn't, uh, I wouldn't breed any
of his stuff unless I would, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of asked him kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even with this, like with all my
genetics, my, my, uh, B 93, I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to say, I can't sell that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people, I was offered a lot of money
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working out a deal right now to trade
somebody for it, but it's going to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's just because I want, uh,
Sam skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, um, I have an opportunity to get the,
one of the original skunk one cuts back.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were and Sean, you, I think you in
town with that fucking that epileptic
[SPEAKER_01]: asshole kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tilly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just this kid that,
um, Brills was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was brought to me by the TCC,
the Toronto compassion center,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, said, listen, we have this kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's, uh, he's a good grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but he's mixed up with the wrong
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to get him out of this town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you take them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Got him and his mom and his sister to
London, set them up in an apartment,
[SPEAKER_01]: set up a garden, the whole bit turned out
to be a great gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it went to his head and then shift
course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That, that, that original story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never finished.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's still dwelling in that
reality where he was always a go super big
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then getting in business with really
bad people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would always go very, very,
very bad West.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as soon as he left here, because it
happened over and over and over,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and like, he would always be
like, like when, when he would get fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: destroyed, he'd be like, I'm never growing
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm never growing again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he's like buying or he's involved
in these like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Giant farm chicken coops filled,
you know, like it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I, when I met him, we, he was because
of his and his mom, I loved his mom and
[SPEAKER_01]: his sister.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but they had no control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would, uh, we would grow,
he would grow a bunch of pot for the
[SPEAKER_01]: center.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would give them a receipt and then I
would give them a certain amount every
[SPEAKER_01]: week or every month, because if I gave all
the money to Billy, which I did in a few
[SPEAKER_01]: times, he went out and literally bought
$200 with the candy home and come to his
[SPEAKER_01]: house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, I was like, where's the
money you were supposed to pay your hydro
[SPEAKER_01]: bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fuck man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, he's literally had bags of
fucking candy and his mom, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not just that, but I remember the
dude would be like stretches, long
[SPEAKER_03]: stretches of time where all he would eat
is like lobster dipped in butter or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he was just that type of guy that was
like, it was always extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was after me because I didn't allow
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he started hanging out with a egg
boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got fucking busted in my truck with
480 plants or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get sucked into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad got sucked into it because it was
his, you know, and I was just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they drop off a vehicle because
we switched vehicles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turns out to be stolen, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm driving around in a stolen fucking
Jeep Cherokee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that sucks, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like really fucking douchebags,
but that's skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the whole reason the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had, we had him growing the black
domino and the skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this skunk one, I had, again,
it just landed in my lap through all these
[SPEAKER_01]: connections.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would imagine it would have came from
the early Sensi days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was that fucking real skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a fine Dutchman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is his name Scott?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine Dutchman is Eddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew it was a common name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was supposed to be one of the
original skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sellers of the seas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he had like some of the more pure
genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: His were called the pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw that here too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have an old Sensi skunk one pack in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I have the old pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you have the pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have an old pack up here myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not as old as yours though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so missed out on some of the seed
packs showing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You missed out, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I just lose you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hit a button on my fucking
keyboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black, actually black domino was out of
anything that I've personally popped from
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam, as far as seeds that were
available to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the nicest thing I've,
I personally found.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember the, the description?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, it would leave a man
feeling whipped and something like the
[SPEAKER_01]: description that the, that the boys put in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, when we, uh, when Ron was doing
the, uh, Canadian cannabis cups here in
[SPEAKER_01]: town and we had the red devil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of stole that kind of mantra from,
from that to describe the red devil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making up a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a fucking fire strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a bunch of bullshit that I was
saying, but, um, the first time I saw a
[SPEAKER_00]: red devil, I believe it was greenhouse
that came out with that early.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the first people to sell public
seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: See the red devil I ended up getting was
from an alcoholic guy that was a good
[SPEAKER_01]: grower from around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, uh, um, what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Red devil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in your catalog and, uh, Afghani
Afghan skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always wondered if, if like
Shanti doesn't still, I we've,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never known it, but like if,
if, you know, if he tries to sell a
[SPEAKER_00]: version of that based on, you know,
cause he sells devil, but they've never
[SPEAKER_00]: explained what the fuck it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard about the devil, but I don't know
if it's a, and again, the red devil was a
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting brought to me and, um,
it w we just had a fucking great phenol of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was friends with fucking crazy Ron
that, uh, hidden jungle, which was a seed
[SPEAKER_01]: company in, uh, one of the original seed
companies, actually it was before iron
[SPEAKER_01]: iron seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, but, uh, yeah, we entered the red
devil in his cannabis cop and at one first
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I fixed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you keep much Willy jack stuff around?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he was one that was doing like a lot
of early girl and black.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Repros black.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he was from around here too,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But he did his breeding in.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was from Ontario, but he did his
breeding in Montreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's Willie Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Willie Jack.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever see Willie Jack, how he did
his fucking breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know nothing about Willie Jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a lot of questions about him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to, like, literally I did a
lot with the Quebec seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was his fucking guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and now again, I can't remember his
name, but he did a cannabis cup there as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, Willie would basically in his
backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: The longest fence line, again,
this is what I was told.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would grow a male and a female and then
five feet, 10 feet apart, another,
[SPEAKER_01]: a different male and different female.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you buying a seed and his seed was 30
bucks for mixed packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was saying, oh, this is Northern
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is this train.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this train.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has no fucking clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might have some of that in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be honest with the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're only charging $30 a fucking 10
pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to make shit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, fucking tell people that this is
what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how I breed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm only charging you 30 bucks,
you know, but I didn't, I didn't like him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think, I thought he was kind of
dishonest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if, if that's, if that's how he
was doing his shit, it's obvious that
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, the cross pollination is
going to occur, you know, that's not cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, what's the, what are some of the
posters behind you before I forget?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Oh, this is a chemo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen before that the,
uh, the one chemo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I think it's the fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know one of them went pink and I'm
pretty sure it was the Ottawa cut that
[SPEAKER_01]: went pink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be the UBC one, but basically the
auto one, one is probably just a UBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that was pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a spice of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strain too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who the fuck Eric is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so this is, uh, so let me just get the
seat back in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I don't mind sending you a bunch
of these seeds if you want to fucking try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and a, me and a good friend will try
reproducing any appellee.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: UBC chemo or chemo poster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it was a fucking centerfold and I
had, Oh, no shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to pick this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this here is where's the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this here is the Berry Berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, and it actually says it in the
upper corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, sorry, I have to try to get
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this here is the chemo and might be the
Ottawa cause it's pink pistol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think, I think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can, you know, this is what I've
been told, but it's super nice because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's super pink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have tons of fucking photos of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I see, you know, I told people
for years, like chemo sounded cool,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like, and everybody always said they
liked it, but the name always turned me
[SPEAKER_02]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, the theory that they,
the history was like the G 13 that it came
[SPEAKER_01]: out of California and it was used,
uh, for medical patients that were going
[SPEAKER_01]: to chemo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, maybe the cut came out of
beast out of, um, California might've been
[SPEAKER_01]: called something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to UBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were using it maybe for medical,
uh, for chemo patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it got its name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was just told that, uh, yeah,
it got its name from, uh, from VU.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this also, this was another centerfold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to see because of the,
uh, glare.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also Berry Berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't really see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe better that way, but, um,
it was like, it was a go-to strain for me
[SPEAKER_01]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was just, uh, it was so one
thing I'll say about this chat is because
[SPEAKER_00]: it, we wildly bounce around.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like all kinds of things that I
think of that I want to chat about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time that I want to merged
onto some different year, totally
[SPEAKER_00]: different people, whatever, it's amazing
in that regard because we're covering so
[SPEAKER_00]: much ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, you said your friends with red,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've chatted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's with the fast spear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in, uh, with his no shirt on this
fucking guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He showed up to the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see if I can find a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you take a picture of that later and
send it to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was Matt, there was this,
uh, we, I used to go to these harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: festivals in the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was this guy, Matt knows who he
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this guy, Chip, um, that started
Royal gold, Matt, and he had just been out
[SPEAKER_00]: to Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was an Oh one maybe or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I remember the first time I saw
pictures, like you were mentioning of
[SPEAKER_00]: those fields and hectares and huge
greenhouses and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came back with all these photos on his
computer of all these people in
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland that it would just starting to
blow it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time it was the largest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they would do it under aroma
therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had, this is one of, uh,
this is a field here.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it was for, uh, aroma therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of a, that's us harvesting
some of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember way back then when you were out
there, somebody showed me a picture
[SPEAKER_03]: because you weren't around and it was you
sitting in an armchair flower up to your
[SPEAKER_03]: knees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you've seen in the frame was like
flower up to your knees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the young people watching now that
are like in their, in their twenties,
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at this and they're thinking,
yeah, that's it right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did, we had terracotta floors and we
didn't have enough place to hang it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you, the funniest thing is on the,
on the table there, there's only,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, two sets of scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know what we, we had to harvest
all the tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went through the field, harvested
all the tops, brought them back and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, we can't even hang them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just laid them all terracotta and we
just went in and rotated them every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, uh, me sitting in the chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for people like Matt was saying
for people that are younger, I think
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland for the most part was the
first time that it was like us seeing like
[SPEAKER_00]: non land race type pictures of people
actually growing on that large of a scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people used to seeing big CBD
grows here is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people our age are used to seeing
these massive hemp grows and stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: but people during that era, you would
never fucking see this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was really, it was a really unique
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very special time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for that era, like people in the U S
seeing stuff like this was mind blowing at
[SPEAKER_02]: the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: See this here, that's, we had a company in
town called no backs and you're supposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to take your bag into different parts of
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, entered in a contest,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I basically got the most votes,
but they can't, they, because it wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got fucking, uh, the boot, there was a,
do you know Felix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Owl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, this is his field in, in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had such shooting plans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, super nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: His, uh, like his this is his,
his, what his field looked like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, have any of his stuff saved?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: He used to supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so impossible to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so impossible to get in the U S cause
he just never shipped here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like, and none of the
distributors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so this is the sweet tooth garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, oh, very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we, we, um, sorry for the
fucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that picture before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a great picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so that,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that one is there's, there's a few
of the Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the skunk one on this side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other side is our skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a black story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dark picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has the black domino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before you offload that, let us know
so we can make sure that thing stays alive
[SPEAKER_02]: forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, I have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sending it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: To, um, the guy for the skunk one cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm giving him the, uh, the,
the B 98, the widow 95 and the,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, B 93 would be nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was our Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was my version of Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the size, that's a four
inch cube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were just like, when you see the,
the size of the nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I picture looking like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, it was the best sea of green
plant and it was in the, and it was an L
[SPEAKER_01]: like, was it a pure NL?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but it looks a lot like what
I would picture the NL five cut looking
[SPEAKER_02]: like.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it was just, you know,
um, it was, yeah, it was just a phenomenal
[SPEAKER_01]: cut kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's another one of red fucking
boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like in that's him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we would, we had such, this is in
Switzerland too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had such a fucking good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when everybody loved everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, when he, when that guy first
showed up the fucking Switzerland fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: guy sees the field, he gets all excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes home and he shaves from his like
shoulder down to his wrist, back of his
[SPEAKER_01]: hands, shaved his entire arm, both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what the fuck are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, dude, I'm running through the
field with my arms out and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: make hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted finger rub.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made it like fucking 10 feet,
20 feet, lost his breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't get a fucking quarter of a
fucking gram off of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you gotta be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was a good thought, good effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: He literally did shave his fucking arms,
but I don't think he got a single fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: gram of hash kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we made it about two hours in right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's so much more we can cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but we could do a part two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hoping actually that we could have
you back and we could, we could see if we
[SPEAKER_03]: could get Kip back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, or maybe even Chris clay also as an
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know that like I mentioned before,
there was about, I don't even know how
[SPEAKER_00]: many questions or how many follow-ups I
could think of while you were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we just tangent it off onto
something totally different, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you don't have to apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have ADHD too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you read my book, like I can eat up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can send you a copy if you need or I
need a signed copy stream of
[SPEAKER_01]: consciousness, which I liked, you know,
my book is written that way because I
[SPEAKER_01]: wrote it as if I'm having a conversation
and I had to hire somebody to listen to
[SPEAKER_01]: me, take notes, and then try to put it in
fucking order.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not in perfect order.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking at it going because I
smoked a lot of pop back then I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I remember it happening this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another story that crosses with
it doesn't line up perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just, fuck, I don't know,
but I did make a huge mistake in my book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it wasn't my mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a misprint where it says that I
grew a cannabis cup winning strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a fast beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was my fucking not my strain,
but I grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I was the one that chose to enter it
in the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys didn't want anything to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew it was going to win because the,
it was honor the goddess, which was all
[SPEAKER_01]: the female judges.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got hired by sativa sisters,
Karen.
[SPEAKER_01]: She flew me to Amsterdam just to be a
fucking gigolo guy slut because I fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: have a good time and I like fucking
females.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went boy and I got laid a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's why, um, that's why we relate so
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now, we're now, we're now speaking
Sean's language.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just smiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, fucking it's because of that,
you know, all the growers out there now
[SPEAKER_03]: know that you can get laid and be a
grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to cut off in two hours?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still, he brought this beautiful,
hot fucking yoga girl from Texas to work
[SPEAKER_01]: his booth and he was all stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he's going to get some that
chick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took her home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took her back to my hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was like, I don't want to leave
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I got no place to stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never made, made my return flights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's like, Oh, you can just stay with
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what are you saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, Oh, one of Tony's places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh, do you think this guy
who flew you there paid for all your shit
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be okay with me coming?
[SPEAKER_01]: To fuck you in his place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony, Tony, you know, Tony's a rock star,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm the coolest, cutest fucking
Sebastian Bach wannabe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had like long hair, beautiful mane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, and here comes this fucking,
you know, uh, New York dread.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had fucking, he saw the pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dreads were not fucking anything of,
to write home about at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sleeping in a field for the last
fucking two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I was eating off of a dirt
floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, you know, and I was fucking the
hottest chicks kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a simple farm hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but, um, yeah, so yeah, sorry about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I do, when I do talk, I go down
different veins and, Oh, no, I wasn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't criticizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just simply saying that like,
as you've talked about a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: different stuff, there's like different
things I wanted to go off on and then
[SPEAKER_00]: something totally else interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to take, you got to take notes as
we're talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kept recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, I want to talk about that.
