[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_02]: counterculture that is Canna.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_02]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be joined by members of the Canna
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_03]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_03]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_03]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Matthew, here today with Thousandfold
and our friend Ben Chicken, who is one of
[SPEAKER_03]: my favorite masters of the mutants out of
Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that, I'm going to kick this over
to Thousandfold to start the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think we're having like an
interesting moment with ABC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like, you know, Matt's obviously
just released some testers with the
[SPEAKER_01]: subterfuge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that Caleb has had various forays
into that territory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, quite very, very interested to
hear from Ben here about his time working
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe to start us off, Ben,
I'm just going to call you Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: You thought I was saying Ben earlier,
but how did you get, why were you
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in ABC to start with?
[SPEAKER_03]: And when did you start jumping in or even
hear of ABC?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it is one of those weird legends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks for having me guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my journey with ABC, we always in
Australia, it was known that it was
[SPEAKER_05]: getting around, but it was quite hard to
obtain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I always had an attraction to it
because it's such a stealth variety.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I always thought if you could get your
hands on the stealth variety, it'd be
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty good to be able to grow and just
have that extra layer of
[SPEAKER_05]: disguise, getting ABC in Australia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did try and I tried multiple methods
of doing so.
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked at all the forums and I did find
some people who had ABC quite recently
[SPEAKER_05]: before the releases, but I was never able
to acquire any physical seat of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: As it turns out, the person who held ABC
for all this time was definitely very much
[SPEAKER_05]: offline all throughout that period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess you could probably call that a
big part of being an older, an older fella
[SPEAKER_00]: up North.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I had one, one prompt you,
which was, does the fact that it's called
[SPEAKER_01]: Australian bastard cannabis, like did that
resonate with you at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it even from like, I don't know much
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you two know quite a lot more
about the backstory and I know we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to probably dig into that a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, how does it actually, how does this
all begin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone tell me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is just my, um, understanding of
it and I'll admit I don't really
[SPEAKER_05]: understand what happened before this point
but I've spoken to a fellow from up north
[SPEAKER_05]: and he's held it he acquired it in a small
town north New South Wales at a a tip
[SPEAKER_05]: which is a dump we would call it America
and he acquired those seeds around 1990
[SPEAKER_05]: from just a local fellow and he grew those
seeds and he found what we call now
[SPEAKER_05]: Australian bastard cannabis it had
different names back then so then he grew
[SPEAKER_05]: this plant and preserved it in a sense
where he was he's just an avid gardener
[SPEAKER_05]: and he's always keen he grows a lot of
plants and he was always just keeping it
[SPEAKER_05]: pure quite simple and is growing it
throughout he actually told some funny
[SPEAKER_05]: stories where there was a a gardening show
that came to his house and in the
[SPEAKER_05]: background of the film because they're
filming his gardens he had ABC growing so
[SPEAKER_05]: that's quite really shows the the stealth
of this plant yeah and he attempted to
[SPEAKER_05]: make a few hybrids with it but he had no
success he didn't really have the the
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding knowledge as it wasn't really
shared at that time and he was completely
[SPEAKER_05]: offline and he did hand it out to a lot of
people and I imagine this is where ABC
[SPEAKER_05]: surfaced here and there on the forums with
different people probably acquiring it
[SPEAKER_05]: from him would be a guess yeah if you want
to touch on what you know Matt yeah from
[SPEAKER_03]: the American point of view like we it
wasn't really well-known until Mark Emery
[SPEAKER_03]: dropped it in can't always forget what the
Canadian it's like the Canadian version of
[SPEAKER_03]: high times and there was an ad in there
for being able to buy ABC across the flow
[SPEAKER_03]: and I want to say I don't remember if
there was any ABC peer in there but he had
[SPEAKER_03]: a story about it and he was the first
person as I'm aware to call it Australian
[SPEAKER_03]: bastard cannabis and that's when most of
us Americans were aware of it and a few of
[SPEAKER_03]: those people one being Hybe received those
original seeds but it was very limited
[SPEAKER_03]: super limited and a lot of people
throughout the years up until and up until
[SPEAKER_03]: as recent as the the big release with CSI
and Painted Forest it nobody a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people didn't believe that it was even a
plant that existed or that it was even
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis you know there's been a lot of
arguments about that over the years I
[SPEAKER_03]: think we touch on a later episode too
that's coming out maybe before this one
[SPEAKER_03]: but recorded before about you know Fett
from Spice Brothers having a plant called
[SPEAKER_03]: dizzy it was very very similar and that
also showed up on the forums not sure
[SPEAKER_03]: where he got his from but he always said
it wasn't related to ABC but it was
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously the same mutation so that's kind
of like how the Americans took on to this
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's been a big myth and only a few
people had it and like you'd have to pay
[SPEAKER_03]: you know five hundred thousand dollars for
a clone if you wanted it some absurd
[SPEAKER_03]: amount yeah but a lot of us were obsessed
with chasing it buddy resin lung tried
[SPEAKER_03]: flying out to Australia at a few different
points to pick it up and was never able to
[SPEAKER_03]: find the person who had it you know asking
around and in been elsewhere yeah that's
[SPEAKER_03]: that's kind of how the American backstory
goes as opposed to the Australian I kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of want to ask you Matt what are your
impressions of it given that you've
[SPEAKER_03]: recently done some work with it it's what
I expected except for that I didn't expect
[SPEAKER_03]: it to be longer flowering looking at it
you think of it as like this little slow
[SPEAKER_03]: growing plant so you think it must be some
kind of Afghani offshoot but I think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: a much longer flowering typically sativa
type variety it has thicker thicker leaves
[SPEAKER_03]: like ivy and looks more like an ivy plant
to me or basil as it were but yeah that's
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the first impressions you can get
into turps and all that stuff later and of
[SPEAKER_05]: course hybrid perspective so yeah I can
touch on a funny story when you mentioned
[SPEAKER_05]: the flow f1 seeds yeah released by Mark
Emory so the old mate up north of me he
[SPEAKER_05]: was aware of this release and he had a
friend who actually purchased these seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: from Mark Emory and he purchased it for
the flow which is I thought was quite
[SPEAKER_05]: funny and his flow was not available in
Australia yeah I thought that was quite an
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting take on that's how Australians
perceived it so people were buying this
[SPEAKER_05]: ultra rare mutation and they were
searching through the population to remake
[SPEAKER_03]: flow it's funny I never really guessed
that way Mark Mark said he used flow to
[SPEAKER_03]: increase the potency of ABC which I
thought was a weird choice for a potency
[SPEAKER_01]: increase on anything to be honest so just
just so I can get this right you were
[SPEAKER_01]: saying that originally these seeds were
from Australia but then some other people
[SPEAKER_01]: from Australia got it from Canada as well
is this correct that's correct from Mark
[SPEAKER_03]: Emory yeah that would have been late IDs
early 2000s if I remember correctly
[SPEAKER_01]: fascinating yeah okay well how about you
tell us a bit more about your actual
[SPEAKER_01]: journey how long has it been that you've
been working with it with ABC I've been
[SPEAKER_05]: working so I acquired ABC from CSI
Humboldt through that Painted Forest Farms
[SPEAKER_05]: collab in 2019 so I was pretty quick off
the gates I saw it I knew it was coming
[SPEAKER_05]: and that was the first first purchase
through CSI that I've made and my first
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds I actually bought from America I've
been waiting to get ABC so I was
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely gonna grab them and then it's
pretty much as soon as I got them I did a
[SPEAKER_05]: small open pollination seed increase style
and then I dug through that population and
[SPEAKER_05]: I did my first out cross to a plant from
Wally Duck and that's a double salad xamel
[SPEAKER_05]: so it's a good plant and it really suits
the Australian climate I'm looking back I
[SPEAKER_05]: did a lot of work with ABC that ended up
being dead end and you'll find that when
[SPEAKER_05]: you're working with ABC it really
sometimes it doesn't hurt to just take a
[SPEAKER_05]: step back and really realize what I've
done here doesn't really work so I did a
[SPEAKER_05]: freak show hybrid with ABC just to see
what combinations those two plants would
[SPEAKER_05]: result in and I grew out quite a large
amount of f2s f3s and then I started into
[SPEAKER_05]: the f4s and I found the best plants in
there were subterfuge one leaning or this
[SPEAKER_05]: is a subterfuge one hybrid I did later
sorry not pure ABC and then the plants
[SPEAKER_05]: that combined both mutations were actually
worse than ABC and worse than freak show
[SPEAKER_05]: so I kind of just called that quits
because they just didn't want to grow it
[SPEAKER_05]: was just that doubling up of mutations and
these plants would just get too funky to
[SPEAKER_05]: function they're just no good yep but it
was interesting yeah yeah yeah they're
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty okay sorry slight tangent here just
to give us a bit more backstory how much
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding had you done before this and why
yes I had you worked with prior to I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: relatively young and I worked with Aussie
bushweed so there's the first plants that
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew were in hindsight extremely
difficult plants to grow so I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_05]: if you're aware of the kind of seeds that
get around Australia in the bush scene
[SPEAKER_05]: this is and they were essentially no idea
yeah these Asian genetics that are kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: acclimatized to Australia so you'd almost
compare it to a tie so these plants were
[SPEAKER_05]: flowering 20 weeks plus they were very
intersex prone just difficult to grow in
[SPEAKER_05]: general and they grew like bamboo these
things grew humongous so I go completely
[SPEAKER_05]: outdoors and the first kind of project I
did kind of was to I really like these
[SPEAKER_05]: plants they're quite trippy and had really
good effects and I actually preferred
[SPEAKER_05]: working that over anything I would buy and
I combined that with another bush strain
[SPEAKER_05]: which is just unnamed bag seed within
Australia and I found it completely tamed
[SPEAKER_05]: the intersex traits and it kind of brought
that flowering time down to about 15 weeks
[SPEAKER_05]: which still is long but it's a lot more
manageable and then from there it was kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of a deep dive because I realized oh hang
on I can actually I actually created a
[SPEAKER_05]: plant that in my opinion is better than
both of these two parent lines and then
[SPEAKER_05]: from there I kind of got into the forums
having a look around and then I kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: discovered ABC and then I was trying to
chase that down with no luck for many
[SPEAKER_05]: years and then I kind of fell down that
classic advertisement trap for about a
[SPEAKER_05]: year which is you know the the whole
European feed banks I think it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_05]: given for everyone who's new and
everyone's journey for sure yep so I grew
[SPEAKER_05]: plenty of those and then I kind of dropped
all that work and then through the forums
[SPEAKER_05]: came across Wally Duck and I started
growing his work for a while and that was
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of my first project I was really
proud of so I combined a couple of his
[SPEAKER_05]: lines and that was the z99 hybrids I did
which was sour z99 crossed to a allow type
[SPEAKER_05]: plant and it created something that you
need a good climate for it's definitely an
[SPEAKER_05]: outdoor variety but it was kind of like
Aussie bushweed reworked and I found it
[SPEAKER_05]: was just that little bit better than all
the bag seed you're getting around it was
[SPEAKER_05]: just so hardy drought tolerant just really
suitable for our climate and that sour
[SPEAKER_05]: diesel really kind of bumped up the flavor
just make it a little bit more interesting
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah so that was like my early work and
then not long after a couple years after
[SPEAKER_05]: that CSI did the release and then since
then I've just been on a really deep dive
[SPEAKER_05]: into ABC and it's been growing ABC and
other clone onlys and stuff in Australia
[SPEAKER_05]: Australia is starting to form its own
clone scene which is quite interesting so
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm growing a bunch of heavy days his work
and I really rate his work he's got some
[SPEAKER_05]: really good genetics and I've actually
using one of his well-known mines the
[SPEAKER_05]: jelly breath which is like a Mendo breath
leaning hybrid the cookie hybrid into
[SPEAKER_05]: improving the the new worked abc line I'm
doing just take that step further and try
[SPEAKER_01]: to increase the the density so yeah that's
kind of where I'm from now so I know that
[SPEAKER_01]: CSI also did some abc cookies stuff why
cookies because I personally I personally
[SPEAKER_05]: chose cookies so originally I'll give you
a backstory of where I'm at so I've made
[SPEAKER_05]: this dual gar plant which is an extreme
outlier within the abc population so it
[SPEAKER_05]: grows like a normal plant it's very sativa
dominant if you know abc like like matt
[SPEAKER_05]: was saying earlier it um it kind of looks
like an indica but it is not it comes from
[SPEAKER_05]: Aussie bushweed which I was saying is a
really long flowering acclimatized
[SPEAKER_05]: southeast asian varieties so I imagine
that the genetic origin of this mutation
[SPEAKER_05]: so I introduced cookies later on because I
really want to increase the flower density
[SPEAKER_05]: because there is pretty significant issues
with pure abc flower density and it could
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely use a little bit of a potency
boost well potency is not as bad as people
[SPEAKER_05]: give it like the credit I would say a
cookie type hybrid could definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: improve a few characteristics and I think
that's kind of the obvious goals with
[SPEAKER_05]: working with abc and I think that's
probably why CSI has gone down a similar
[SPEAKER_05]: path and you'll see use the tk which I
think offers quite similar um you know
[SPEAKER_05]: benefits to bring into abc so you
basically you're the selecting trait that
[SPEAKER_05]: abc lacks and you're picking an outcross
that you know does exceptionally well with
[SPEAKER_05]: those traits and trying to just bring them
in while keeping that abc leaf if that
[SPEAKER_01]: makes yeah if that covers it yeah yeah
matt what was what was your take on that
[SPEAKER_03]: matt no I was that that's exactly what I
was going to say it was the calyx to leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio and density um the other thing that
you know maybe a bit of a stereotype or no
[SPEAKER_01]: it's probably a true thing I know that um
it tends to lean towards topinoline the
[SPEAKER_01]: abc and ben I've talked to you a little
bit about you know what it's like with
[SPEAKER_01]: your newer hybrids what are both of your
thoughts on the you know it's it's high
[SPEAKER_01]: topinoline bent yeah if you want to go
first matt I mean I can't really comment
[SPEAKER_05]: because I only have the hybrid like a
later hybrid okay sure so with pure abc
[SPEAKER_05]: pure abc has is 100 of the population in
my opinion I've grown quite a few of them
[SPEAKER_05]: in the pure form and they're all
topinoline and they're quite a two
[SPEAKER_05]: two-dimensional topinoline I'll add it's
quite a boring flat topinoline yeah and
[SPEAKER_05]: that's where the hybrid kind of we want to
say subterfuge one it's still topinoline
[SPEAKER_05]: mostly um although it is a little bit more
odd exactly three-dimensional be one way
[SPEAKER_05]: to put it it's a little bit more
interesting you can tell those other
[SPEAKER_05]: plants within it but recently I've
actually managed to budge this topinoline
[SPEAKER_05]: dominance like this linked trait so I do
have plants in the garden right now that
[SPEAKER_05]: smell nothing like topinoline and they
reek of almost a garlic kind of smell so
[SPEAKER_05]: that's interesting to finally break in
that and I have the theory that once this
[SPEAKER_05]: trait's broken I think it'll be quite easy
to introduce other topin profiles I agree
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah so we'll see how that goes yep real
quick that's really exciting before we go
[SPEAKER_03]: away too far and also because it keeps
closing on my phone the longer it takes I
[SPEAKER_03]: brought up the page from um resin lung
when I first asked him when we were going
[SPEAKER_03]: to do this episode probably when we first
started talking about doing it I asked him
[SPEAKER_03]: for his the backstory on like the American
version and his uh his travels to the ABC
[SPEAKER_03]: thing and he kind of told me more about
the history with Mark Emery too and how
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark Emery got it so I wanted to toss it
in before we get further in um uh and this
[SPEAKER_03]: is direct quotes it says first to bring it
to the table was Mark Emery his magazine
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis culture had an article about a
harvest festival in Nimbin Australia in
[SPEAKER_03]: like 98 99 most most pro-drug town in
Australia I guess I don't know if that's
[SPEAKER_03]: correct but uh Dana Larson chief editor of
the magazine at the time wrote the story
[SPEAKER_03]: and took the pictures after the harvest
festival Dana hooked up with someone that
[SPEAKER_03]: called himself Mr Avery if I remember
right that drove him a couple hours away
[SPEAKER_03]: but still in North South Wales to his
secret grow out in the bush to check it
[SPEAKER_03]: out Dana left Australia with 200 seeds um
and I believe some of the seeds were
[SPEAKER_03]: uncrossed and some were crossed with flow
the mutant article ended with Emery
[SPEAKER_03]: offering those seeds as a giveaway to
subscribers first come first serve that's
[SPEAKER_03]: how Hive got his I believe he said a
friend had of his had subscribed and gave
[SPEAKER_03]: him the seeds uh cannabis culture had like
two little updates in the following years
[SPEAKER_03]: on the progress which wasn't all that
great but proved that the line was still
[SPEAKER_03]: alive eventually Fett came up uh and
showed the pics with the backstory and
[SPEAKER_03]: that was Fett from Spice Brothers who
worked with uh D-Man it's going to be on
[SPEAKER_03]: our show um he claimed to have gotten the
line in the early to mid 90s after seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: a huge grow uh grow bust of some new super
potent mutant weed on the news that had
[SPEAKER_03]: happened to be close to where he lived I
believe he claimed he went there and was
[SPEAKER_03]: able to steal it plants cut seeds I don't
know I remember reading posts from people
[SPEAKER_03]: that had claimed to have seen reports of
the bust and supposedly the growers were
[SPEAKER_03]: so confident about its ability to not be
recognized as weed that they went way way
[SPEAKER_03]: too big and uh and and and screwed
themselves uh Fett could have found fields
[SPEAKER_03]: of it I guess who knows not long after
I've starts posting pics and messing with
[SPEAKER_03]: Fett uh Fett claimed that what Emery was
able to get out of Australia was bunked
[SPEAKER_03]: and not related to what he had Fett
claimed his was a tropical plant and what
[SPEAKER_03]: Hybe was working with was more indica Fett
claimed his line was super potent and
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't display the dwarf phenotypes that
Hybe's line did uh Hybe would crush Fett
[SPEAKER_03]: with real botanical knowledge whenever
Fett would start in on him I've also had
[SPEAKER_03]: just busted out the whole Femseed deal and
seemed to butt heads with Fett about that
[SPEAKER_03]: too Fett was not into Femseeds uh Fett
seemed like such a whiny bitch about
[SPEAKER_03]: everything and then it goes on to Mongie
Man a few years later after Hybe and Fett
[SPEAKER_03]: started in on each other another dude from
Australia popped up with what I believe to
[SPEAKER_03]: be a pretty interesting story and I'm
gonna have Vin chime in on this if he
[SPEAKER_03]: knows anything after uh he claimed to have
known two elderly people who had been the
[SPEAKER_03]: original discoverers of the mutant Mongie
Man or Mongie Man claimed that these two
[SPEAKER_03]: elderly growers had taken him under their
wing and taught him everything they knew
[SPEAKER_03]: about growing and when they had grown too
old to grow and because he had shown
[SPEAKER_03]: interest in the mutant they gave him all
their seed stock of it he claimed to have
[SPEAKER_03]: grown it everywhere in plain sight for
years he had crossed it with everything
[SPEAKER_03]: available available at the time all the
sativas he said that they gave the seed
[SPEAKER_03]: away for years to anyone who wanted it
until he eventually noticed that it was
[SPEAKER_03]: being sold by a few people at that point
he disappeared and planned to never
[SPEAKER_03]: mention the line again until the internet
was invented and he noticed two guys
[SPEAKER_03]: arguing about Mongie Madness that's when
he told his story and he said oh Mongie
[SPEAKER_03]: claimed that the elderly couple had
stumbled upon the mutant plants while
[SPEAKER_03]: hunting for weed in Hunter Valley a place
famous for wild marijuana growing all over
[SPEAKER_03]: the region and young Australian hippies
making the trench or the trek early each
[SPEAKER_03]: year to load up on the free weed in like
the late 60s and 70s supposedly they
[SPEAKER_03]: walked into a patch of the mutant weed
growing and were uh educated enough to
[SPEAKER_03]: recognize it as cannabis and collect
living samples and seed coolest of all the
[SPEAKER_03]: stories but recessive genes and shit a
patch in the wild uh with all that
[SPEAKER_03]: non-mutant pollen flying around not
impossible but and then he lists the names
[SPEAKER_03]: and he just basically said nobody liked it
uh mutant bindi weed bindi uh parsley pot
[SPEAKER_03]: basil buds manji weed marigold and
clayton's um when he went to nimbin he
[SPEAKER_03]: spoke to the mayor who runs the cannabis
museum there and he knew all about it not
[SPEAKER_03]: where he could get seed of it but
everything else uh yeah that's that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: backstory from someone who was much more
educated than i am from the american
[SPEAKER_01]: version i have a very like not important
question to ask which is ben do you think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's like a mong like not mongy but like
mong like you know your mong good question
[SPEAKER_05]: i don't know i've always just read it
online so i just read it as mongy madness
[SPEAKER_05]: but mongy to me kind of refer to something
that's a bit like obscure and like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know um deformed would be a way mongy yeah
we know where that comes from i think we
[SPEAKER_01]: won't say that on the show yeah yeah
exactly but sorry anyway i'll let you
[SPEAKER_01]: reflect more broadly on what matt said
yeah what do you think of that story i
[SPEAKER_01]: love this i just got a say i love the we
have like a bit of a murder mystery
[SPEAKER_03]: whodunit vibe to this one this is the way
it's always been with this fucking plant i
[SPEAKER_03]: swear to god that's why there was so much
chase for it because it was just a mystery
[SPEAKER_05]: plant from the beginning exactly so you
mentioned the hunter valley yes um wild
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis fields and that is recorded as
something that was real and the government
[SPEAKER_05]: did a pretty intensive job of making sure
that was eradicated that's too bad but
[SPEAKER_05]: they did struggle for a while i believe to
actually wipe it out because australia has
[SPEAKER_05]: a quite a good climate and that area in
particular is it's relatively suitable for
[SPEAKER_05]: growing for that the whole elderly topic
of you know people taking him under his
[SPEAKER_05]: wing i'm actually not too sure because i
probably know just as much as you i've all
[SPEAKER_05]: i've done is read that online that was
well before my my time but what i can say
[SPEAKER_05]: is i have tried to document everything
that i can actually prove from this point
[SPEAKER_05]: forward and that was talking to that old
fellow up north so he's had abc for um
[SPEAKER_05]: over 30 years and he said he passed it out
to multiple people throughout having it
[SPEAKER_05]: and he said no one actually really held on
for very long so i think it takes a
[SPEAKER_05]: certain type of person and in australia
it's a little bit different especially
[SPEAKER_05]: back then like um how do you explain it um
these people might not have understood
[SPEAKER_05]: exactly what they were working with or
approached as well it's not quite it's not
[SPEAKER_05]: very productive why would i grow this and
not actually seeing it as a breeding tool
[SPEAKER_05]: rather than just seeing it for what it is
at that point in time because it obviously
[SPEAKER_05]: has the potential to be pushed a lot
further just as a naturally occurring
[SPEAKER_05]: mutation is probably what i would say its
origin is and i can also i've spoken to
[SPEAKER_05]: painted forest farms and this older guy up
north and he's actually the fellow who
[SPEAKER_05]: gave painted forest the farms and that
ended up in csi's hands doing the
[SPEAKER_05]: reproduction so i've connected all those
dots so that's kind of good to have at
[SPEAKER_05]: least recent history for once something
about who you see is solid recorded and
[SPEAKER_05]: that was painted forest farms was on like
a vacation holiday in australia and he was
[SPEAKER_05]: in a small town i won't mention the name
up north and he met an old grower at the
[SPEAKER_05]: back of a pub or around a pub because he
was smoking a joint and he was obviously
[SPEAKER_05]: drawn to that and then he ended up going
on a hike with him around the national
[SPEAKER_05]: parks and he showed him a few of his grows
and he showed him that he'd been growing
[SPEAKER_05]: this mutant plant abc as we know now know
it and painted forest farms obviously got
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds from this old fellow up north and
then because this old fellow wasn't
[SPEAKER_05]: actually he wasn't holding it tight that's
the funny thing he was just offline so he
[SPEAKER_05]: wasn't hoarding it he just didn't really
know that people wanted it because he'd
[SPEAKER_05]: given it out multiple times throughout
history and he just grew it in his garden
[SPEAKER_05]: grew it in the national park and never
thought much of it so it's quite a i think
[SPEAKER_05]: it's quite lucky that painted forest farms
got seeds and and of all the people to
[SPEAKER_05]: give that to it couldn't be much better
than giving it to csi who was able to do
[SPEAKER_05]: like a legit open pollination and then
send these out at a reasonable price i
[SPEAKER_03]: think the timing on it was insane because
during those prior maybe three years
[SPEAKER_03]: before that happened me him and resin lung
were on a massive chase to try to figure
[SPEAKER_03]: the history out and get the seeds so when
he showed up with them i was fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: skeptical as shit because i already knew
that hive had had them and that you know
[SPEAKER_03]: hive had a grow in oregon and that people
were working on it and it would have been
[SPEAKER_03]: possible for him to get it that way so i
was definitely skeptical when i heard the
[SPEAKER_03]: painted forest painted forest farm story
like oh you just happen to have it when
[SPEAKER_03]: we're looking to buy it you know like kind
of thing but it's very much faded i think
[SPEAKER_03]: in the end you know like it had to have
been so weird how the universe works
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes so i wanted to ask like a really
obvious question just to kind of sign post
[SPEAKER_01]: like the significance of abc because
obviously for matt resin and caleb to be
[SPEAKER_01]: chasing this it must have some great
potential impact um and i know we we've
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of implied it but can we spell it out
a bit more like what do you two see as the
[SPEAKER_05]: potential impact of abc yeah so for me
like i'll kind of refer this to it kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: relates to breeding goals with abc so you
kind of see this not for what it is at its
[SPEAKER_05]: current point of appeal abc plant but i
believe it's just full of potential like
[SPEAKER_05]: there's so much variation within it and
that's quite interesting we actually don't
[SPEAKER_05]: really understand what this mutation is or
how it works and i've actually experienced
[SPEAKER_05]: it affecting other parts of the plant so
you see that the growth structure of abc
[SPEAKER_05]: is completely different to non abc types
so i'll first i'll point out like the
[SPEAKER_05]: obvious traits that you'd be like oh you
see this plant i want to improve the
[SPEAKER_05]: flower quality and growth habits while
retaining the stealth of the plant so you
[SPEAKER_05]: can kind of grow it in your backyard
without nosy neighbors so that's improving
[SPEAKER_05]: the flower density flavor effects but then
i'd like to take it a step further and
[SPEAKER_05]: think about what abc like what else it
might actually have to offer and i think
[SPEAKER_05]: it has because of all these unique traits
within its mutation we might not actually
[SPEAKER_05]: understand how beneficial abc
[SPEAKER_05]: for example you just cut out for one
second oh sorry that's it so real quick
[SPEAKER_05]: you're good we don't really know what abc
might have to offer and it's quite drought
[SPEAKER_05]: tolerant would be one one trait that i've
noticed within my garden and i'll i'll
[SPEAKER_05]: link that to smaller leaf surface area
maybe the thicker leaves slightly waxier
[SPEAKER_05]: leaf so we don't know it might actually
end up producing more drought tolerant
[SPEAKER_05]: plants that can grow in a more arid
climate or be frost tolerant it could
[SPEAKER_05]: potentially have some unique cannabinoids
hidden within its gene pool that we don't
[SPEAKER_05]: actually know about and then another thing
just even take it one step further would
[SPEAKER_05]: be is there any value in the non abc types
of the f2 population and i say this so i
[SPEAKER_05]: grew a bunch of girl scout cookies times
abc f2 population from csi and i kept some
[SPEAKER_05]: of the non abc types in that f2 population
just out of curiosity and one individual
[SPEAKER_05]: in particular grew like a normal plant but
it had traits from the abc so it had
[SPEAKER_05]: extremely long pedioles it had an almost
red black stem it had fingers coming out
[SPEAKER_05]: of the center of the leaves and a really
complex webbing you wouldn't call it
[SPEAKER_05]: duck's foot but it was more complex than
duck's foot and while those traits in
[SPEAKER_05]: particular aren't very beneficial that was
one plant and you could run through
[SPEAKER_05]: thousands of these non mutant types and
you could find something that grows like a
[SPEAKER_05]: normal plant is a normal plant but it's
drought tolerant because of a thicker leaf
[SPEAKER_05]: so we don't actually really understand how
beneficial abc might become and we might
[SPEAKER_05]: view abc in the future as something
completely different to what we view it
[SPEAKER_05]: today of what it's brought to the market
and that could be compared to let's say
[SPEAKER_05]: auto flowers and how they fill the niche
within these northern climates with the
[SPEAKER_05]: the day length cycles so exactly that's
kind of where i would say i think it's got
[SPEAKER_05]: an unknown potential but i think it's got
a lot of potential yeah oh sorry man i was
[SPEAKER_01]: just going to say a little thing and then
i'll pass it over to you i was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: say that um it's a really really nice
breakdown and to me really interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're kind of also making a
distinction between like known unknown and
[SPEAKER_01]: then unknown unknown potential if that
makes sense um but yeah sorry matt please
[SPEAKER_03]: take take take it away um what goes along
with the uh drought resistance um and i
[SPEAKER_03]: think you're dead on when you say about
the leaf thickness and stuff there's
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously better water retention in these
leaves smaller leaf surface is pest
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance you'll find that like things
like spider mites are going to have a
[SPEAKER_03]: trouble penetrating to a a deeper
thickness of the leaf so you get major
[SPEAKER_03]: pest resistance with a lot of this stuff
and i think especially for outdoor growers
[SPEAKER_03]: in the us that's like the number one other
than mold and i've watched these things go
[SPEAKER_03]: through a a complete frost cycle where i'm
at outdoors and it it it pummels through
[SPEAKER_03]: it it has no problem with it so for
outdoor growers this could be a complete
[SPEAKER_03]: game changer and to touch on the other
part i truly truly think that when you
[SPEAKER_03]: find things that aren't in our current
gene pool being used whether it's
[SPEAKER_03]: something like this we want to hold on to
because they're not going to be the norm
[SPEAKER_03]: they're always going to be the outliers or
they at least have the potential to have
[SPEAKER_03]: those outliers of cannabinoids that could
have medical relevance or value so that
[SPEAKER_03]: that's that's a lot of what uh pushed me
for it and that the look and the stealth i
[SPEAKER_03]: mean if you're growing in an urban
environment like you you have to hide
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff from neighbors or whoever may be
there you know thieves even and uh looking
[SPEAKER_03]: at this plant most people that aren't
cannabis growers and even most cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: growers wouldn't immediately look at it
and think it's cannabis you know so that
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah you touched on pretty good uh points
there um i wondered if we could do a
[SPEAKER_01]: little tangent here and compare the other
mutants we know um you mentioned freak
[SPEAKER_03]: show duck's foot already we should go over
duck's foot because that's one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: least understood and overused terms and
people don't even understand that it was a
[SPEAKER_03]: strain in a specific trait then do you you
are you friends with wally i am mates with
[SPEAKER_05]: wally and i spoke to him about duck's foot
and his story behind duck's foot so he
[SPEAKER_05]: acquired it through a mate and he just had
some plants growing and he explained to
[SPEAKER_05]: him quite poorly and then he actually went
to his house and was like wow look at
[SPEAKER_05]: these these are pretty indistinguishable
from cannabis seedlings so he saw the the
[SPEAKER_05]: stealth characteristics straight away and
he was quite new to breeding at that point
[SPEAKER_05]: and he admitted that he did quite a poor
job because he didn't understand what he
[SPEAKER_05]: was working with and he wishes he could
take a step back and get those original
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds and start again yeah he's not sure
where it came from from that point and you
[SPEAKER_05]: know it did re-pop up back in hawaii at a
certain point and that was brought across
[SPEAKER_05]: and he made a hybrid from that so the one
in australia that popped up was actually
[SPEAKER_05]: quite an indica type plant and it was
really skunky yeah and the one in hawaii
[SPEAKER_05]: was a more sativa type and he he reported
that those hybrids were really good um and
[SPEAKER_05]: he said it was actually some of the most
potent weed he's ever smoked was the
[SPEAKER_05]: original duck's foot which is quite
interesting because i'm sure he's gone
[SPEAKER_03]: through some yeah interesting plants yeah
yeah um so in in modern times i see a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of people using it to refer to like ogkb
leaves as duck's foot there's a story from
[SPEAKER_03]: um an idiot in hawaii who thinks that
duck's foot is the creation of uh og kush
[SPEAKER_03]: you know um there's a lot of stories out
there there was as as has been referred to
[SPEAKER_03]: um there was the hawaiian webbed indica
and i don't know if it was more sativa
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily but it was definitely crossed
to things like c99 too before it came to
[SPEAKER_03]: the states and that would make sense you
know because those are the seeds that were
[SPEAKER_03]: out there i don't think anybody got the
hawaiian web pure um but what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about with duck's foot it is a
leaf that is fanned out and it's called a
[SPEAKER_03]: webbed leaf because there's no so there's
no individual leaves it's one big leaf and
[SPEAKER_03]: um you can tell that it's meant to have
into individual leaves but they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no serrations between them if that
makes sense and that's an actual webbed
[SPEAKER_03]: trait and that trait has been seen in
hawaii which may be from the duck's foot
[SPEAKER_03]: or maybe a completely separate plant and
then there's the duck's foot from
[SPEAKER_03]: australia um but yeah it's very very
unique and and people use the term and
[SPEAKER_03]: i've talked to a lot of people nowadays
that didn't know that duck's foot was a
[SPEAKER_03]: strain and a trait they thought that it
was just a a reference to things that have
[SPEAKER_03]: weird looking leaves inside like urkel so
yeah i wanted to clarify that part for a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of the newer growers that aren't
committed with it with the ducks so beyond
[SPEAKER_01]: the superficial fact that these two mutant
types look different from conventional
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis um are there other connections
between them like in terms of the traits
[SPEAKER_01]: are there overlaps in the traits or like
uh similar types of potential in both of
[SPEAKER_05]: these so firstly i'll say just for anyone
who doesn't know abc and duck's foot in my
[SPEAKER_05]: opinion are completely unrelated and if
you grow them side by side you see the
[SPEAKER_05]: very different plants so i'd say i'm not
i'm not definitely no expert on duck's
[SPEAKER_05]: foot but i don't actually know what it
could bring to the table it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_05]: similar argument with abc where it could
offer some sort of things we don't
[SPEAKER_05]: actually understand it could create a more
beneficial leaf shape not too sure um
[SPEAKER_05]: although when growing duck's foot like
when wally first uh received it his
[SPEAKER_05]: initial um thoughts were that it could be
used as an incognito plant and i think
[SPEAKER_05]: that's a good value that duck's foot has
especially back then when abc and freak
[SPEAKER_05]: show were not available or friction hadn't
been bred yet okay yeah maybe the first
[SPEAKER_03]: thing i wanted to do with it was make the
auto flowering duck's foot that was my
[SPEAKER_03]: original goal with it and i was actually
growing duck's foot out like in the
[SPEAKER_03]: apartment complex that i had at the time
when we were running a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_03]: apartments i would keep it outside on a
ledge next to this big condo thing and you
[SPEAKER_03]: could see it on eighth avenue if you
walked by you would see these plants and
[SPEAKER_03]: nobody would identify them as cannabis
except in the morning because when the sun
[SPEAKER_03]: hit it smelled like straight skunk like
skunk skunk but i remember when smoking
[SPEAKER_03]: these and these were um i want to say
these were f2s or f3s from seed bay back
[SPEAKER_03]: then i don't remember if it was via direct
wally or someone else that used them to
[SPEAKER_03]: make the f2 there was no potency
whatsoever to him by that point it was
[SPEAKER_03]: very um uh hempy for for lack of a better
term so i ended up not going through with
[SPEAKER_03]: it but the idea was to make like an auto
flowering stealth plant for people to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to grow outdoors in in urban
environments so that yeah that was my main
[SPEAKER_01]: point with that that's cool no thanks
thanks to both of you for that um can we
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about freak show for a bit as well
since we're here um you know how how do
[SPEAKER_01]: either of you think that that lines up
against the other two as far as the mutant
[SPEAKER_03]: i had been i have no experience with this
one this is all yeah i've grown a fair bit
[SPEAKER_05]: of fracture i find it quite fascinating
and i find it's a really good
[SPEAKER_05]: accomplishment for someone to actually
create a mutant which in my opinion is
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a very extreme serration of a leaf it
makes it for those who don't know it
[SPEAKER_05]: almost appears like a fern and it grows
quite well especially in um high rainfall
[SPEAKER_05]: areas it's quite mold and pest resistant
and to the untrained eye you just don't
[SPEAKER_05]: pass it off as cannabis kind of that
similar thing with abc where i actually
[SPEAKER_05]: think most people identify cannabis from
the traditional leaf shape and not
[SPEAKER_05]: actually the flower or any other traits or
the way it's growing but just a classic
[SPEAKER_05]: five finger well you know that just that
typical cannabis leaf that's what 99% of
[SPEAKER_05]: the people when they think of cannabis
that's what they view yeah it's iconic and
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah exactly and it's i grew freak show in
a few hybrids or freak show obviously i
[SPEAKER_05]: did a pure abc and a subterfuge freak show
hybrid and auto bastard hybrid but i found
[SPEAKER_05]: it was actually quite hard to work with to
an extent freak show is it's a mutation
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's not quite like abc where it's abc
or not abc freak show has these
[SPEAKER_05]: intermediate types within the f2 i thought
was interesting and it's actually i'm
[SPEAKER_05]: getting a bit of a tangent here but it's
also quite a potent flower i found not
[SPEAKER_05]: overly potent but it's not like abc or
like those ducks you're talking about matt
[SPEAKER_05]: like it's quite comparable it has a
interesting oh a turpentine ish but
[SPEAKER_05]: different kind of skunky turpentine smell
to it and i know there's some hybrids out
[SPEAKER_05]: there now that are like the berry freak
and they're pushing away from that profile
[SPEAKER_05]: and still retaining that leaf shape and
that's the work i'm not 100 sure but i
[SPEAKER_05]: believe it's the son of the the guy who
originally bred um freak show the shape
[SPEAKER_05]: shifter i'm not too sure in the 100
backstory of freak show but growing ar
[SPEAKER_05]: either it's a great plant and so it really
shows what can be pulled out of cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: like it's a very extreme outlier it's yeah
really interesting very cool no this was a
[SPEAKER_01]: i think this is a good tangent um just
because it it gives more context abc right
[SPEAKER_01]: comparing it to these other types and also
i think it might disambiguate uh i think
[SPEAKER_01]: for some people like these these mutant
types are kind of all like rolled up
[SPEAKER_01]: together or they're like you know they
might seem like they're overlapping but
[SPEAKER_01]: they're all actually quite distinct um it
takes it takes a certain type of person
[SPEAKER_03]: also to chase mutants i really i really
think so like it's not big in the niche
[SPEAKER_03]: well it's not big in the niche cannabis
collection genetics community even like
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody who's interested in genetics
like and and zeroes in on that you know
[SPEAKER_03]: not everyone is also centering in on
mutants it takes it takes certain kinds of
[SPEAKER_03]: minds and i don't know how to explain it
any better but i think one way i can see
[SPEAKER_01]: it is that there's like a longer view
right it's a long play yeah um and you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to be ready to commit to that and
have the patience and have the dedication
[SPEAKER_03]: to commit to that which is obviously yeah
look at a plant for more than it's what
[SPEAKER_03]: it's showing you and not everybody's ready
for that i can frame it a bit more like
[SPEAKER_01]: brutally uh it's more than just what the
plant can give you in the short term
[SPEAKER_05]: exactly yeah and i'll put push that even
further by saying abc comes with a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: challenges it's not like growing typical
plants especially in its pure form and
[SPEAKER_05]: i'll also note that a lot of and i might
be wrong a lot of the seeds in america are
[SPEAKER_05]: subterfuge one hybrids yes so the a lot of
people haven't actually seen how painful
[SPEAKER_05]: and how interesting pure abc is these
plants barely grow vertical they grow
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes wider than they do tall and
there's some serious challenges with those
[SPEAKER_05]: traits and they go extremely slow and
they're all kind of linked traits like if
[SPEAKER_05]: you do an outcross and you bring it back
to the f2 a lot of i'll say almost all of
[SPEAKER_05]: your abc types will revert back to that
growth habit so that really dwarf um
[SPEAKER_05]: really small leaf low flower density to
penylene dominance low potency all those
[SPEAKER_05]: traits kind of come with this bundle of
what is abc and i'd also like to say hey
[SPEAKER_05]: you were saying a lot of people don't work
with it and i think that's because it
[SPEAKER_05]: takes so long to get results so i've done
like i was saying that freak show hybrid
[SPEAKER_05]: i've done multiple abc hybrids and i've
grown like that freak show hybrid i i
[SPEAKER_05]: sprouted thousands and thousands of
seedlings and i completely just abandoned
[SPEAKER_05]: that project and so there's four
generations of breeding and i kind of just
[SPEAKER_05]: came to a dead end and then i had to start
again and try something else so it's
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely takes a lot of patience and it
takes a certain type of person someone
[SPEAKER_05]: who's doing it because they want to do it
not because they're trying to get an
[SPEAKER_05]: immediate result it's definitely a long
game like you were saying and also add one
[SPEAKER_05]: more thing abc is super unpredictable like
i'll come up with these theories and i'll
[SPEAKER_05]: get this giant door guard type plant so
i'll touch on where i'm at now i've pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: much found this outlier male plant and it
grows like a normal plant it produces
[SPEAKER_05]: offspring it's an abc type but the leaves
are about the same size as a normal
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis plant slightly smaller it grows
it grew about three over i think it was
[SPEAKER_05]: 3.2 meters in a single season tall so it's
definitely not like normal abc and the
[SPEAKER_05]: string that offspring that it produced it
actually passes these traits of the large
[SPEAKER_05]: leaf 280 small leaf abc it's hybridized
with which is really interesting so it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: really rare phenotype but it breeds
dominant so i think that's quite
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting and then when i say it's
unpredictable if i've recently done some
[SPEAKER_05]: jelly birth three bx1 hybrids with this
plant and i've taken that currently to the
[SPEAKER_05]: f3 but i'm digging through the f2
population and i've found plants that are
[SPEAKER_05]: completely comparable to pure abc once
again within this pool which is amazing
[SPEAKER_05]: because this thing is multiple outcrosses
separated from pure abc and it's still
[SPEAKER_05]: popping its head up on occasion which i
find is that that's extremely stubborn and
[SPEAKER_05]: while i am finding the average i'm finding
some really nice plants but i really am
[SPEAKER_05]: surprised to see these pure abc types
poking back up yeah anyway that's about
[SPEAKER_05]: all i can say for the challenges with abc
it's really cool um uh one thing i
[SPEAKER_01]: actually wanted to ask earlier was um what
have your conversations with csi been like
[SPEAKER_01]: i know that you've had a few exchanges
with him in in your process and i'm quite
[SPEAKER_01]: curious to know like what what you guys
talked about if you if you're keen to
[SPEAKER_05]: share yeah for sure so when he first
announced that he was doing a abc
[SPEAKER_05]: reproduction i hit him up immediately
because i was pretty i was pretty shocked
[SPEAKER_05]: to be honest i was like oh it's finally
happening and then i think i might be
[SPEAKER_05]: wrongly saying this but i think initially
not that many people gravitated towards
[SPEAKER_05]: working with abc for those same reasons i
just mentioned it's just it's not a fast
[SPEAKER_05]: process it takes a certain type of person
and i think i originally shared my abc and
[SPEAKER_05]: subterfuge freak show hybrids um with csi
because i did i think yeah he did uh at
[SPEAKER_05]: least an f1 hybrid of freak show and abc
just to see if um those traits appeared in
[SPEAKER_05]: the f1 um and i took that step further by
taking it to an f4 um i think he was quite
[SPEAKER_05]: interested in that and then as soon as i
found this dual gar male which is it was
[SPEAKER_05]: quite an interesting plan it was to do
with a failed reversal then introducing a
[SPEAKER_05]: male from another abc gene pool as a
replacement so it was actually a a double
[SPEAKER_05]: sour xamal times abc site four and i did a
an f2r of those and then i re-reveged my
[SPEAKER_05]: favorite female from that population and
it was a sour diesel leading f1 and then i
[SPEAKER_05]: was planning on doing another reversal
with another plant onto this and that
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't reverse well um and i had luckily i
had a a peanut butter breath time
[SPEAKER_05]: subterfuge one i actually got that off a
mate captain nemo cannabis and that was a
[SPEAKER_05]: male and i pollinated a large branch of
this double sour xamal f1 abc and from
[SPEAKER_05]: that was i just found that extreme outlier
and i immediately when i saw that plant as
[SPEAKER_05]: a seedling i was like whoa what do we got
here because it was growing faster like
[SPEAKER_05]: i'm not even lying it was actually going
faster than everything in the garden
[SPEAKER_05]: non-mutants and mutants so it was a super
vigorous plant large leaves so i
[SPEAKER_05]: immediately sent csi an email saying oh
this could be kind of like an outlier that
[SPEAKER_05]: would be very beneficial to the population
and luckily the year before that he sent
[SPEAKER_05]: me the girl scout f2s the tkf3s and then i
had a few of my hybrids which i was all
[SPEAKER_05]: growing and i was also growing a pine
carcush subterfuge one hybrid from a buddy
[SPEAKER_05]: on overgrow and i pollinated everything in
the garden i had i kind of exactly
[SPEAKER_05]: remember how many they had a bunch of the
tk f3s and one of them was really nice um
[SPEAKER_05]: abc type it was definitely an og kush lina
and i had a girl scout cookie lina in the
[SPEAKER_05]: f2 population and then i had one of the
pine tar kush that was really nice and
[SPEAKER_05]: that kind of created what has been the
most well received hybrid which is the
[SPEAKER_05]: pine tar duliga cross and it um in my
opinion produces plants that are probably
[SPEAKER_05]: the best abc's out there i would say while
it is to penelene it's kind of a very
[SPEAKER_05]: complex to penelene it's like a lime
syrupy fizzy kind of smell and the effects
[SPEAKER_05]: are really nice and it's actually quite
potent which is surprising or comparable
[SPEAKER_05]: to pine tar kush potency so yeah with csi
i'm curious to see what his next move is i
[SPEAKER_05]: know he's just um an f2 that grew out an
f2 of the girl scout cool he's and that
[SPEAKER_05]: looks pretty nice and he tested on the
purple pro and you could see that it
[SPEAKER_05]: bumped up the potency to 15 by memory and
i'll be curious to see if he digs deeper
[SPEAKER_05]: into which direction he takes it i think i
think we've been talking and feminized
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding is probably the key to
stabilizing different terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_05]: within the abc so that's going to be
probably my next move and i've recently
[SPEAKER_05]: pollinated a very popular clone in
australia which is the jelly breath 3
[SPEAKER_05]: clone that's from heavy days so i've got
my jb3 ex1 times to oliga f2 back cross to
[SPEAKER_05]: the jelly breath 3 so that's kind of a
double outcross to the jelly breath types
[SPEAKER_05]: and then i'm going to inbreed that and
just filial breed that and i'm just going
[SPEAKER_05]: to use feminizing practices from here as
advice from csi because i think i think
[SPEAKER_05]: he's right by saying you don't really know
what your males are offering as terms of
[SPEAKER_05]: if they're carrying the tip handling so
it'd be good to just eliminate that
[SPEAKER_00]: entirely yeah that's all i can say there
thanks may any thoughts on that yeah the
[SPEAKER_03]: the feminized breeding part of abc we kind
of stumbled on on accident um i had i had
[SPEAKER_03]: been doing my creamy punch project
outdoors and i had pollinated a um
[SPEAKER_03]: subterfuge plant and it ended up herming
and pollinating one of the other creamy
[SPEAKER_03]: punch plants and i remember you know i
hadn't i hadn't tested them and some other
[SPEAKER_03]: people were running through them and these
abc types were popping up and i was like
[SPEAKER_03]: wait a minute that's not the abc cross one
and if it was it wouldn't be showing any
[SPEAKER_03]: of the mutations what's going on here and
i remember taking it to benchick and i was
[SPEAKER_03]: like what the hell is going on and that's
when we kind of because we had been
[SPEAKER_03]: advised by other people that had done
subterfuge breeding that it wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: possible in reversals for it to show up so
fast so when it showed up i showed it to
[SPEAKER_03]: csi i was like uh i think we know exactly
like what's going on here and it looks
[SPEAKER_03]: like it shows up in the next generation
makes it speed through the generations
[SPEAKER_03]: real fast so uh we not only did we kind of
figure that out with abc but we can apply
[SPEAKER_03]: it then further to um auto flowering and
everything else so that's kind of like
[SPEAKER_03]: this weird little uh twist of fate again
like as we were talking about doing some
[SPEAKER_03]: other weird projects together with csi
that the abc projects lended itself to
[SPEAKER_03]: like that kind of trait also carries over
to other traits in reversal and yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: benchick can help me figure it out and
make sure that i wasn't losing my fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: mind either that was really weird and
unexpected yeah that's that's about all i
[SPEAKER_01]: can add to that super interesting yeah um
you did you did mention their auto abc or
[SPEAKER_01]: some one of you did at some point and uh
kind of like to hear a bit more about that
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah so i've grown hypertext autobasted
one and to be honest i could immediately
[SPEAKER_05]: tell and i might be wrong but i think he
worked the auto bastard a lot more than he
[SPEAKER_05]: worked with subterfuge one the auto
bastard is the closest thing i can compare
[SPEAKER_05]: to the jb hybrids and the pintard do lugar
that i've been working on so you could
[SPEAKER_05]: tell that they're kind of more separated
from abc the the resin production and the
[SPEAKER_05]: flower density um has been significantly
improved and even the growth habits have
[SPEAKER_05]: been um drastically improved from the
subterfuge one with the auto abc i did
[SPEAKER_05]: come across some issues that occur just by
combining because in their sense it's two
[SPEAKER_05]: mutations combined into one and because
abc is inherently slower growing um these
[SPEAKER_05]: plants don't get very large because the
auto flowering kind of just makes them go
[SPEAKER_05]: into flower as soon as they're sexually
mature to as a sense and i'm not sure i
[SPEAKER_05]: explained that very well but a traditional
plant will grow faster and reach a decent
[SPEAKER_05]: height before it starts flowering where
the abc has a a slower growth exactly but
[SPEAKER_05]: overall i could definitely uh shout out
hybrid tech on that one there were some
[SPEAKER_05]: really good abc hybrids and i would say
they're much better than subterfuge one
[SPEAKER_05]: and obviously pure abc
[SPEAKER_01]: really cool yeah um matt did you have any
thoughts on auto auto bastard or like i
[SPEAKER_03]: you know i think i think it's probably the
future is is reversals like you were
[SPEAKER_03]: saying um speeding through generations to
make auto bastards would probably be the
[SPEAKER_03]: quickest way to do it and and like what we
were talking about even with uh auto
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers in general we realized that
because you cannot revedge these things or
[SPEAKER_03]: clone them a lot of the pollinations done
in auto flowering is just it's really guns
[SPEAKER_03]: like shotgun style like you got to hope
that you hit something right and most
[SPEAKER_03]: people just take it a few generations
whether they hit something they wanted or
[SPEAKER_03]: not and just release it so yeah i mean i
like the idea of fem breeding that in that
[SPEAKER_03]: sense for auto flowers too and auto abc
seems to be quite the ticket with two uh
[SPEAKER_03]: two different traits of breed similar
[SPEAKER_01]: um yeah i don't really know what else do
you guys think we could cover here yeah so
[SPEAKER_05]: one thing i was thinking about was as
we've kind of covered a little bit but
[SPEAKER_05]: techniques in breeding with abc yeah so
when i first started breeding with abc it
[SPEAKER_05]: was very hard to get a grasp on what am i
actually working with here how does it
[SPEAKER_05]: inherit and while to me at this point it
kind of seems like general knowledge um
[SPEAKER_05]: for a lot of people they don't actually
understand how abc traits pass on through
[SPEAKER_05]: generation to generation so i'll firstly
start by just saying if you have a pure
[SPEAKER_05]: abc plant and you cross that with a non
abc type zero percent of your f1
[SPEAKER_05]: population will be abc from what i've seen
and i've grown a lot of f1s from the f2
[SPEAKER_05]: you'll pull out 25 abc types and you'll
find that this number is actually a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit closer to 20 20 to 22 percent and
that's just because abc seeds are
[SPEAKER_05]: inherently harder to germinate so you will
have a few seeds that won't germinate and
[SPEAKER_05]: those ones will most likely or more likely
than not be the abc types so that will
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of throw out your ratios but 25 of
your abc seeds will be the doubling up of
[SPEAKER_05]: the abc um trait and the f3 population if
you cross an abc type with an abc type
[SPEAKER_05]: you'll get 100 abc type within that f3 and
and and obviously f4 and onwards if you
[SPEAKER_05]: cross another situation which a lot of
people have been doing i've seen is you'll
[SPEAKER_05]: have an abc f1 and you'll cross it back to
an abc and that will result in 50 abc
[SPEAKER_05]: types in that following generation so i'm
not too sure how you would label that it's
[SPEAKER_05]: like an f1 back cross to abc and something
that i've been toying with and i've
[SPEAKER_05]: actually spoken to csi about a little bit
is doing an f1 hybrid so let's just say
[SPEAKER_05]: abc hybrid times a non abc type like a
clone only something that you want
[SPEAKER_05]: desirable traits from getting that f1
population which is carrying one set of
[SPEAKER_05]: the abc gene and then crossing that back
to that clone only so that will produce 50
[SPEAKER_05]: of your plants will have no abc trait and
then the other 50 percent will have high
[SPEAKER_05]: have one set so none of them will look
like abc and half of them will carry the
[SPEAKER_05]: trait so then you do an open pollination
of those and you segregate your male
[SPEAKER_05]: separate them into each so you do
different lots and then from those when
[SPEAKER_05]: you pull out it will be a very small
percentage maybe about five percent abc
[SPEAKER_05]: types in that next generation depending on
where your males lie you'll do a double
[SPEAKER_05]: out cross so it'd be kind of attempting to
speed up the process of locking down some
[SPEAKER_05]: traits so i'm going to experiment with
that so that'll be quite interesting to
[SPEAKER_05]: see how that goes because that's all just
theoretical and that could also be applied
[SPEAKER_05]: to other sets of breeding such as auto
flowers if you're trying to speed up our
[SPEAKER_05]: crossing but the good thing about abc is
is you can pull out your abc types or your
[SPEAKER_05]: non abc types in the seedling stage unlike
auto flowers where you don't actually know
[SPEAKER_05]: if it's an auto so you can have a thousand
seedlings and you can automatically pull
[SPEAKER_05]: out the 50 that abc types within week so
that's quite handy so you can really speed
[SPEAKER_05]: up that selection process and another
thing i'd like to say with the techniques
[SPEAKER_05]: i think it's very important to choose your
outcross your outcross non abc type
[SPEAKER_05]: carefully and think about what does abc
need and what can this outcross give to
[SPEAKER_05]: abc that will improve those traits that
you're after whether you're trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: increase the flower density like i was
saying with the cookies hybrid i typically
[SPEAKER_05]: don't work with cookies but i i do notice
that it has very good flower density and
[SPEAKER_05]: if let's say you're a big fan of
depenelene uh something like trainwreck
[SPEAKER_05]: might be a perfect outcross and it might
just uh enhance what you've already got so
[SPEAKER_05]: it really depends on what you've goal is
and then once you've done this out
[SPEAKER_05]: crossing you really need to fill your
breed it and you really want to do careful
[SPEAKER_05]: selections through your f2 f3 and because
you'll find that your f3 will still be
[SPEAKER_05]: extremely variable and you'll still be
getting those pure abc types popping up
[SPEAKER_05]: and your last point would be you're going
to need numbers that's the reality with
[SPEAKER_05]: working with abc you can't like obviously
you can get a lottery ticket and win but
[SPEAKER_05]: you'll be a lot more likely to find a good
plant if you're running good numbers and
[SPEAKER_05]: you see that with csis kind of work he's
got reasonable numbers to dig through and
[SPEAKER_05]: i think that's pretty essential and that's
definitely what i found especially when
[SPEAKER_05]: you're trying to find outliers within the
population i like the idea of like
[SPEAKER_01]: doubling down on the depenelene just i
find that really funny but it also makes
[SPEAKER_01]: sense some people you know a lot of our a
lot of our guys like love depenelene so i
[SPEAKER_01]: guess you can like you said uh earlier try
to make it more like multi-dimensional to
[SPEAKER_05]: penelene then yeah that's exactly and
that's what that's done it's it's it's
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely to penelene but it's like i
don't know other ways to put it but it's
[SPEAKER_05]: three-dimensional it's got like a
fizziness to it and it's got this
[SPEAKER_05]: syrupyness to it and it's almost sweet and
it's a little bit gross but in a good way
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just um in comparison in comparison
to pure abc which is just in the other
[SPEAKER_05]: words like it's flat and it's quite boring
so you're kind of just working with it you
[SPEAKER_05]: go into pumping it up and that's another
way instead of just going i'm going to
[SPEAKER_05]: completely scrap depenelene and i think
you could probably say maybe that's what
[SPEAKER_05]: hybrid tech's done maybe not but his
plants are definitely still to penelene i
[SPEAKER_05]: know he's on a lot of out crossing how
much now crossing so much exactly but
[SPEAKER_05]: they're still to penelene so it goes to
show how stubborn to penelene is so if you
[SPEAKER_05]: just wanted to just work with what you got
is another option if you do like
[SPEAKER_05]: depenelene i'm a fan of depenelene i'll
proudly admit that yeah um but i'd like to
[SPEAKER_05]: create variations within the abc i don't
want just one abc that's depenelene and
[SPEAKER_05]: that's all you're going to get it would be
good to have some variety and create
[SPEAKER_05]: different strains if you would call it of
abc which i've started doing hashtag team
[SPEAKER_03]: to penelene that's right that's right i
think there's a lot of value in it
[SPEAKER_03]: especially with like like i noticed with
sweet things or fruity it's easy to find
[SPEAKER_03]: things that are fruity and sweet that
don't carry that to the flavor whereas
[SPEAKER_03]: when you cross these things to your
penelene a lot of times the flavor will
[SPEAKER_03]: then carry with their trippin elene so
it'll be like a it's hard to explain like
[SPEAKER_03]: a menthol-y version of that flavor yeah
yeah it clearly is a very nice
[SPEAKER_01]: counterpoint to other yeah other flavors
and it makes amazing extracts insane
[SPEAKER_05]: extracts for those who like extracts yeah
it's like with that for example which is a
[SPEAKER_05]: depenelene dominant i ran out it was 80
plants and it was around 40 females give
[SPEAKER_05]: or take and i narrowed it down to four
females and they're all got different
[SPEAKER_05]: characteristics like you were saying one
of them has a menthol flavor to it which i
[SPEAKER_05]: think's like it was one outlier and it's
quite interesting it's it's almost fresh
[SPEAKER_05]: breath kind of yes it's a feel to it and
then another one is just a extreme resin
[SPEAKER_05]: like just a you know classic resin bomb
it's just this gluey sticky thing and then
[SPEAKER_05]: i've got one which is uh it was being
named the club lime cut and it says
[SPEAKER_05]: baseball bat abc not very dense but this
insane yielding plant also very lime
[SPEAKER_05]: centered and then there's the all-rounder
which i'm using in the next round of
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding and that's just the binge you can
which has been getting around australia so
[SPEAKER_05]: it's it's pretty funny to actually have a
abc clone that's starting to we'll be
[SPEAKER_05]: circulating australia soon it should it's
a heritage strain you know yeah yeah i
[SPEAKER_03]: remember when when caitlin brought these
out there was a person from australia that
[SPEAKER_03]: we knew and he was raging one because it
was called australian bastard he did not
[SPEAKER_03]: like that name and two because he said it
was totally fake he'd never seen it
[SPEAKER_03]: therefore it wasn't from australia and to
that point like it's an australian
[SPEAKER_03]: heritage strain i i think it's awesome
that it's circulating there more yeah and
[SPEAKER_05]: i'm purposely going to try and work more
australian varieties into australian
[SPEAKER_05]: bastard that's cool just for it yeah
because australia has to or i've also come
[SPEAKER_05]: more into the scene recently but we've got
some seriously good cuts getting around
[SPEAKER_05]: australia now like it's just this system
that's starting to circulate i know it's
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously nothing in comparison to the u.s
it's almost like a baby version but it's
[SPEAKER_05]: just beginning and i think it's only going
to get better from here so i've got i'll
[SPEAKER_05]: just shout out a couple cuts on got this
out of curiosity you guys might be
[SPEAKER_05]: interested what's getting around there's
this one it's called hoodoo and it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: crossroad cramp chem time skunk plant i'm
not 100 sure on its lineage but basically
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a chem plant and it is it reeks so i
imagine that's something that you would
[SPEAKER_05]: you guys be pretty familiar with in the
states and then there's another one which
[SPEAKER_05]: is just a crazy runs cut which is a lemon
tree dominant hybrid so it's just a lemon
[SPEAKER_05]: tree times runs and it just obviously it's
just it's interesting to get these
[SPEAKER_05]: standards like i think that's something
that australians don't have that people in
[SPEAKER_05]: the u.s might have you can grow these cuts
that you receive and you can have this
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of a standard that this is tk and
that's a great cup and you can kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: assess qualities of other plants from
having these high standards so it's really
[SPEAKER_05]: good to see the benchmark plant yeah
exactly that's the perfect word benchmark
[SPEAKER_05]: so yeah got like this red wine ash plant
let's do interesting cuts that are getting
[SPEAKER_05]: around it's a deep chunk hybrid and and
raspberry mama queen from heavy days
[SPEAKER_05]: that's another one that's really
interesting yeah yeah and i'm also oh
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going i was just gonna say you know
obviously on the show uh we we definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: are proponents of difference and uh
diversity and so it's great it's great to
[SPEAKER_01]: hear um that there are new and interesting
things happening over there yeah and i'll
[SPEAKER_05]: push in even further to say some of the
interesting stuff i've grown because i do
[SPEAKER_05]: love diversity and i'm being growing 1979
xmas bud from csis reproduction and
[SPEAKER_05]: they're really interesting and i i think
maybe even i find it more interesting than
[SPEAKER_05]: most because i've been brought up on these
long flowering tie type plants and this is
[SPEAKER_05]: the opposite end of the spectrum so that's
really that's really cool to see and
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously it would make a great partner as
well for what's over there exactly and the
[SPEAKER_05]: og kush purple ochre hybrids i've recently
done some of those and i've been doing
[SPEAKER_05]: pink a decent search through the pinks and
perbs population like lot one lot two lot
[SPEAKER_05]: three just going through them and they're
being i actually it's the first plant i've
[SPEAKER_05]: grown where i've never been like this is
like this or this is like this it's
[SPEAKER_05]: something that obviously doesn't circulate
in australia whatever i know it's the
[SPEAKER_05]: killer queen hawaiian combination but
whatever is in that pinks and perbs this
[SPEAKER_05]: is not something you see in getting around
australia so that's quite interesting you
[SPEAKER_03]: know the the killer queens mostly c99
romulan um the hawaiian maybe but i tend
[SPEAKER_03]: to think it's probably what you're seeing
in the variation in mendo perps that's
[SPEAKER_03]: coming through the blackberry widow it's
in that because it's getting a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: unique as fuck even over here the
blackberry widow okay yeah i'm getting a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of uh like dark red wine yeah nose to
that one so that's quite interesting yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah i wanted to kind of make uh sorry
i'll kind of want to pose a more
[SPEAKER_01]: speculative question to both of you just
for fun um you know if you could if you
[SPEAKER_01]: could do abc work with any other line or
cut you know what would you speculate to
[SPEAKER_01]: be fun to try out beyond the ones that
we've already tried so i've actually got a
[SPEAKER_05]: buddy who's doing a project which i'm
really invested in i'll be growing out his
[SPEAKER_05]: f2 population so he's gotten a dual gar
hybrid from me and he's crossed it to a
[SPEAKER_05]: indonesian land racks so it's this
extremely long flowering sativa type and i
[SPEAKER_05]: think in there so the f2 male that is used
is the abc and it's a really resinous male
[SPEAKER_05]: early resin and it's been out cross that's
one of the belly breath hybrids so it's
[SPEAKER_05]: been heavily out crossed and so that
potency should carry along so this should
[SPEAKER_05]: reintroduce the sativa trait that your abc
has but this time without a lot of those
[SPEAKER_05]: negatively associated traits hopefully and
in theory you could create something that
[SPEAKER_05]: will grow really well in australian
outdoors and grow really big and also be
[SPEAKER_05]: potent potent and like highly resinous
which it's kind of has the potential to be
[SPEAKER_05]: a really good outdoor crop so i'll be
digging through those f2 populations
[SPEAKER_05]: shortly i'm really looking forward to that
so that's something that so my patron
[SPEAKER_05]: lives with these land rates that heavers
um so i'll be doing some burmese work soon
[SPEAKER_05]: i've gotten those and some panama red
let's have a look at those i've never
[SPEAKER_05]: actually dug into those those seed stocks
before and if i find something good i'll
[SPEAKER_05]: be maybe incorporating that into this
sativa abc hybrid which will hopefully be
[SPEAKER_05]: a sativa hybrid like pure abc is a
southeast asian hybrid i'll assume but
[SPEAKER_05]: this will be a refined abc sativa that is
actually practical to grow so that being
[SPEAKER_03]: that's i'm interested in yeah that's
unique i like that answer i just go blue
[SPEAKER_03]: bone because that's i was gonna say blue
bastard yeah i mean i did the the creamy
[SPEAKER_03]: punch one so i'm gonna see how well that
turns out close enough is this creamy
[SPEAKER_03]: punch is that a blue bonnet dominant crop
yeah it's a banana punch blue bonnet and
[SPEAKER_03]: silver pearl blue bonnet combined so it
just reinforces the bonnet which is
[SPEAKER_03]: already dominant in both you know and just
a little slight grapey version of it nice
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah we'll see how it goes yeah we have
people growing those out already right
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah you've seen some yeah oh yeah that's
awesome i was gonna say reflect on bins um
[SPEAKER_01]: you know thought that was like man you
really are working with so many different
[SPEAKER_01]: fringe you know or like peripheral like
you know threshold types it's really cool
[SPEAKER_01]: it's actually really amazing to hear about
yeah and i'll also say work in time yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: i'll say that i've never sold flower
that's something that i'll admit um so i'm
[SPEAKER_05]: always just growing for me and my friends
so i have no desire yield is not an issue
[SPEAKER_05]: i'm just all about varieties and this is
for fun for me and hence the breeding with
[SPEAKER_05]: abc because i think you'd have to be like
matt was saying earlier you really got to
[SPEAKER_05]: be a certain type of person to commit to
breeding with abc like i'll be pushing on
[SPEAKER_05]: five years with working with it and only
in the last year and a half have i felt
[SPEAKER_05]: like i've really gotten somewhere and
finally created something that i'm proud
[SPEAKER_03]: of so yeah yeah it's hard to sell it's
it's hard to work lines truly work them
[SPEAKER_03]: unless you have a lot of satellite spaces
and be focused on flower cells it's almost
[SPEAKER_03]: impossible and at some point you have to
make that decision unless you're wealthy
[SPEAKER_03]: enough to have tons of different flower
sites i appreciate it a lot absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah immense amounts of work for sure all
right bin do you have anything else you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to get in or talk about or plug
anything good question i think i think
[SPEAKER_05]: we've covered covered everything yeah
unless you guys have got anything else you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to ask uh i had some rent you know
random uh random question was has anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: on the discord taken you up on some of
those beans maybe this this show will
[SPEAKER_01]: prompt more of them to uh yeah have a go
at it yeah and i would actually offer some
[SPEAKER_05]: advice that'd be one thing i would say and
i don't want to be um self advertising but
[SPEAKER_05]: if you're trying to make an abc hybrid
you're much better off starting at a point
[SPEAKER_05]: that has already you sorry i'll reword
that you're best starting off at the point
[SPEAKER_05]: that's the highest work stage of the
hybrid it would almost be like if you
[SPEAKER_05]: compare to auto flowers and if you i'm
going to make an auto flower hybrid of
[SPEAKER_05]: wedding cake you wouldn't want to grab
something from 20 years ago you would want
[SPEAKER_05]: to grab the most recent work and i'll
highly recommend if anyone was really
[SPEAKER_05]: wanting to make an abc hybrid start with a
dual go hybrid because that outliers
[SPEAKER_05]: already been found these plants already
grow three times faster than normal abc
[SPEAKER_05]: they produce potent flowers they smell a
lot stronger they have really nice effects
[SPEAKER_05]: and they i think they'll be easier to push
into different directions because that to
[SPEAKER_05]: penalty rate has been broken to an extent
and it pops up at a quite a frequent rate
[SPEAKER_05]: you'll find plants that smell nothing like
the penalty so i think it's a much a very
[SPEAKER_05]: very good shortcut and i wouldn't even say
a shortcut but i'll just say it's just
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of a collaboration with the community
to push this plant further would be just
[SPEAKER_05]: to work as a bit of a team because this
plant is very stubborn very and where can
[SPEAKER_05]: people find your seeds if they want them
yeah so in australia i do stock them
[SPEAKER_05]: through a little seed bank pop shelf seed
bank otherwise you can hit me up on the
[SPEAKER_05]: discord chat like in the breeder syndicate
discord which i really like that community
[SPEAKER_05]: and i'm in a few other discords i've
actually got my own discord going yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: tell us about that tell us about it yeah
how do people find it it's just a mutant
[SPEAKER_05]: discourse it's people who are breeding
mutants because it is a funny little it's
[SPEAKER_05]: a wormhole in a wormhole yeah yeah it's a
wormhole in a wormhole so you've got your
[SPEAKER_05]: weed nerds and then you got these weed
nerds who love mutants so it's a certain
[SPEAKER_05]: type of person but i'd love to share that
um that discord with people maybe even
[SPEAKER_05]: post that in the breeder syndicate just
for people who really want to deal dive
[SPEAKER_05]: into it and they can grab some dual gar
seeds and there's people with ducks foot
[SPEAKER_05]: and feature hybrids and all other hybrids
that you know people might find
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting for sure yeah without flooding
your breeder syndicate with abc hybrids oh
[SPEAKER_01]: i've loved i've loved seeing like your
pictures and like any of the exchanges
[SPEAKER_01]: you've had oh yeah i just i think it's
fascinating yeah and it's such a it's such
[SPEAKER_01]: a nice change from you know the usual the
usual suspects and topics yeah yeah i'd
[SPEAKER_05]: love to um hear about and i'll be a a
shout out to csi for obviously doing the
[SPEAKER_05]: initial release but um i'm i'm very keen
to see where he takes his abc work yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: and i would even challenge him to say you
should grow a um a dual co-hybrid next to
[SPEAKER_00]: one so we can see how much better it grows
i'm sure he will yeah i think you'd really
[SPEAKER_01]: i was i was going to make a a point
relative to what you were saying about
[SPEAKER_01]: like you know if you want to make a hybrid
don't take the long route uh you know pick
[SPEAKER_01]: something more a bit further downstream um
i guess the counterpoint of that is unless
[SPEAKER_01]: you were like super super passionate and
you you wanted to have a good kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: revolutionary go at it uh in the way that
someone might with a lot of flowers at
[SPEAKER_01]: some point yeah um because you know there
is also an argument to be made that like
[SPEAKER_01]: okay i don't want to say abc here but with
auto flowers that like some of their
[SPEAKER_01]: groundwork potentially could be redone and
there would be interesting would it not i
[SPEAKER_05]: agree and i'll even touch on if it's not
too late to go back to the topic pure abc
[SPEAKER_05]: pure abc like in saying going back i
really recommend people grow it if you
[SPEAKER_05]: don't expect to get any decent flower off
it but if you wanted to see the weirdest
[SPEAKER_05]: and wildest expressions within cannabis
pure abc is amazing and um i'm keen to
[SPEAKER_05]: i've actually acquired some really old abc
stock from that fella up north so it's
[SPEAKER_05]: just ones that have been in this cupboard
i've managed to get a couple of them to
[SPEAKER_05]: germ and i'll be doing a little open
pollination with just what i can manage to
[SPEAKER_05]: germ from this old um bag of seeds that
were sitting in his drawer and that will
[SPEAKER_05]: be interesting just to have a little dig
through and obviously just for a
[SPEAKER_05]: preservationist kind of approach yeah
because i do think it is important to
[SPEAKER_05]: preserve it in its pure form just because
it is so unique and like you say sometimes
[SPEAKER_05]: you want to backtrack and maybe we'll lose
some of these traits that we could be
[SPEAKER_05]: advantageous like the drought tolerance
could be lost if we keep hybridizing it
[SPEAKER_05]: and it might be something we want to
reintroduce or just something just for a
[SPEAKER_05]: you know a heritage borderline kind of
approach to cannabis it's definitely an
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting plant but obviously you know
take into account all the various cautions
[SPEAKER_01]: and uh learnings that you you know you've
you've already mentioned uh like you said
[SPEAKER_01]: it would not be like uh an easy or short
journey um no exactly you'd be growing it
[SPEAKER_05]: for fun and you'd be doing it for passion
and even if you're just growing a pure abc
[SPEAKER_05]: just to grow it not to breed with it
because you might want to say i've seen
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah and i'll point out one crazy thing
i've seen in pure abc i've seen a plant
[SPEAKER_05]: with what you would call thorns on pure
abc so little nubs on the base of the
[SPEAKER_05]: stems and almost they're not quite spiky
but like they're round thorns growing all
[SPEAKER_05]: the way up the the woody parts of the
plant and this plant was crawling like it
[SPEAKER_05]: was maybe three times wider than it was
tall the leaves were i'm going to say a
[SPEAKER_05]: centimeter across in the widest point for
very small leaves yeah it produced almost
[SPEAKER_05]: no flower you could not smell it um it
flowered for about 20 weeks and maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: produced enough for half a joint yeah so
that makes sense but just out of fun it's
[SPEAKER_05]: fun to grow and you don't have to worry
about anyone recognizing it because no one
[SPEAKER_05]: is going to look at that thing and think
it's cannabis i just i just had a thought
[SPEAKER_01]: that like uh kind of zooming out all the
way and kind of reflecting on this whole
[SPEAKER_01]: topic conversation um i think it's such a
nice uh contrast um because this is
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis at the fringe like this is this
is what you get to see at its outer limits
[SPEAKER_01]: like of its genetic potential and
diversity and so far away from you know
[SPEAKER_01]: all the modern stuff that we obviously
have to keep talking about that are kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of exploited to shit uh you could say like
uh you know we're at the kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: center of the world pool i guess of
genetics uh like cookies and all that this
[SPEAKER_01]: is kind of like the vast you know this is
like going extreme out all the way to the
[SPEAKER_01]: edge and it's really nice it's really nice
to just like hear about talk about think
[SPEAKER_01]: about and be like that's right even though
we all know the chems and ogs and cookies
[SPEAKER_01]: um it's good to be reminded that the
potential is still vast um out there we
[SPEAKER_03]: want to go for it yeah well you know i
appreciate you coming on the show and uh
[SPEAKER_03]: i'm sure we're gonna have plenty more
people interested in mutant talks and uh
[SPEAKER_03]: like you said you have a discord and we're
gonna try to make that available in the
[SPEAKER_03]: show i just gotta remember to put it in
the description but i'll definitely get it
[SPEAKER_03]: there at some point um if not you know
right when it gets uploaded i hope and uh
[SPEAKER_03]: we're gonna offer the the link in our
discord as well for the people who want to
[SPEAKER_03]: check it out um you can get your seeds in
australia directly from you and what is
[SPEAKER_05]: your instagram username i'm actually not
using kind of trying to fade away from
[SPEAKER_05]: instagram and i actually want to push more
towards the discord approach so i'd
[SPEAKER_05]: recommend people jump on the discord and
in australia top shelf c bank would be the
[SPEAKER_05]: way to go yeah i know that's a little bit
different to the way most people approach
[SPEAKER_05]: it but i think discord especially being
such a small niche i think the people who
[SPEAKER_05]: are looking for that stuff will find it
and i think i think it will keep it um
[SPEAKER_05]: more focused on the topic and i feel like
you can actually talk more about things
[SPEAKER_05]: it's quite a complex plant and i don't
like the way instagram works with you show
[SPEAKER_05]: a picture and you can't really explain
what you're looking at to the to the
[SPEAKER_03]: effect that you want to yeah that's for
sure yeah yeah you got to keep it short
[SPEAKER_03]: sweet hope everybody likes what it looks
like and understands the the complexities
[SPEAKER_03]: of cannabis which most people on instagram
don't tend to got to deal with the idiots
[SPEAKER_03]: who just want us to do that's fucking ugly
you know like they just don't get it yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah i was gonna say basically the same
thing like discord is like a good filter
[SPEAKER_01]: for idiots it is it is true um but yeah
thank you so much it was such a i think i
[SPEAKER_01]: was quite i think i know you and matt have
talked a bit already so i think that
[SPEAKER_01]: already knew the extent of your work but i
don't think i really did understand the
[SPEAKER_01]: scale of work that you've been doing so
yeah really really appreciate you
[SPEAKER_03]: unpacking so much of that for us he's
legit and then yeah i guess uh with that
[SPEAKER_03]: go check out our patreon through discord
uh breeder syndicated patreon i guess you
[SPEAKER_03]: could just go to patreon.com forward slash
breeder syndicate um you can go to right
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.com where we have seeds from the
different members in our discord too um
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah i think that's mostly it you can
find our seeds at group by seeds um uh
[SPEAKER_03]: right seed co europe and lifted there you
go and with that i just want to thank ben
[SPEAKER_03]: chicken again and hopefully we'll be
