[SPEAKER_00]: My texting sucks on the smaller iPhones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is uh This is way better way

[SPEAKER_00]: So I got some new information I thought
was kind of funny and I you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I I don't I don't watch a lot of Reality
TV or anything like VH1 shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't for many like a long long time
But I got my friend Brian Ellis,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's up Mosca?
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Brian Ellis hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the guy that I did the LSD with LSD
not LSD LSD the line use the guy Who that
[SPEAKER_00]: was a part of a collab he got to pick
everything out what he wanted didn't cross
[SPEAKER_00]: etc an amazing musician someone I respect
so Yeah, so we did that together.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hit me up yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, hey man my buddy chance from I
Guess he's the the stallion airs the the
[SPEAKER_00]: rap group the stallion airs And I guess he
was on that show real and chance on VH1,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I mean that was news to me I'm not
I'm not hip to that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so he wants his own strain now
Apparently weed maps this is this you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what a matter of fact, let's talk about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a good topic Let me fix my hair
first though, cuz that's getting my
[SPEAKER_00]: nerves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Apparently weed maps has been hitting
up people telling them like Who was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't I don't show my room at any
feeds I Don't like Dylan and making myself
[SPEAKER_00]: any more of a target than I already am But
weed maps has been hitting up people all
[SPEAKER_00]: over different different companies and
Telling them that they want to go ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: and and make them a strain and I have a
feeling they're gonna do what Snoop Dogg
[SPEAKER_00]: did, you know, try get get some outdoor
booth and pass it off, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like Relabel it as Why would I why
would I be a target that's a good question
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, chance is really nice I talked to
him he was he was a super nice guy super
[SPEAKER_00]: super nice guy but yeah, I guess weed maps
is trying to get these dudes to fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: sign up for for releasing a strain with
them and Just gonna slap their fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: label on some booth and sell it and move
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even making strains They're
just gonna pass strains off man And that's
[SPEAKER_00]: a bummer one of them, you know was fucked
skateboards and I really I would love to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with fucked skateboards, man I mean I
used to wear fucked shirts to school when
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little kid in junior high,
man I used to tell my teachers that it
[SPEAKER_00]: meant Fouché like I was like, no,
it didn't say fight me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Fouché It's a French company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But um, yeah, I thought that I thought
that would be cool But he was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, man weed maps has been coming after
me hard to do a collab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like what fucking weed maps get the
fuck out of here with that what weed maps
[SPEAKER_00]: weed maps The fucking Craigslist of
collectives Fuck weed maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say right now fuck Weed maps I'll
never work with weed maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are fucking corporate cocksuckers
Suck a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all I gotta say about that weed
maps They don't need to be trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: pretend like they can do what we do and
that's an insult to me That they would
[SPEAKER_00]: even be able to fucking try to pull that
off It sucks because they also know a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of these guys don't know anything about
the weed business They don't know who
[SPEAKER_00]: makes what they don't know who's who they
don't know any of that They're new to
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when weed maps hits them up,
they think that is a They think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding man, and they don't know any
better So I talked to the owner of fucked
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Brunetti.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of Bryn's friends Bryn actually
set that up and Which is really rad,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I think that's fucking rad and
He's new to the business So I invited him
[SPEAKER_00]: to come on watch the live feed if he if he
has time and think about it But I would be
[SPEAKER_00]: stoked to do something with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be one I would be really stoked
to do, you know Yeah, mids map they can go
[SPEAKER_00]: suck a dick Fuck hearing that just makes
me angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's that's the representation
people have up readers is that is weed
[SPEAKER_00]: maps, which is It makes me cross-eyed,
you know But it is what it is man it is
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is What else did I have to talk
about who else did I have to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some shit there's some shit
stewing about what oh If there are any
[SPEAKER_00]: experts in here Illegal alien sign from
San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a rad deck too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a rad deck That is old If there's
anyone that has any knowledge about Tom
[SPEAKER_00]: Hill or his father's lines DM me I want to
I want to want to talk to you But just
[SPEAKER_00]: only if you're familiar with Tom Hill's
dad's lines specifically The scientist in
[SPEAKER_00]: any of his notations if anybody is an
expert on his his lines or notations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know To falsify the true lineage of
strains that they're releasing Every
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking day 90% of breeders do that
falsify the lineage And there's all kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of reasons for doing it one Some people
think that it's protecting their
[SPEAKER_00]: intellectual properties Yeah, Tom's dad
was the chemist that's correct Some people
[SPEAKER_00]: do it because They don't have the lines
they really have and they want to Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll be talking tissue culture tissue
culture again, hopefully Friday if
[SPEAKER_00]: everything goes all right here Sometimes
they do it because they they want to lie
[SPEAKER_00]: about strains that they don't have and
they want it to sell better That's like 90
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of people who do rename we're gonna do
that 90% 90% 90% But no really it's that
[SPEAKER_00]: bad Some people do it on accident because
they they don't know how to chase down
[SPEAKER_00]: provenance and someone tells them they
have a line and they just pass it on as as
[SPEAKER_00]: bull, you know, it's bullshit,
but they think it's real and a Lot of guys
[SPEAKER_00]: make it up because they want to pretend to
be breeders that they aren't and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a good majority of them too man a
Lot of people want to pretend to be
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders want to pretend to have the
knowledge that they don't and again I
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge any of them to do what the fuck
I do Come on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let everyone fire questions at you about
breeding about any of this shit Let's see
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can really answer some fucking
questions Let's see if you can make sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I challenge all of them to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very few who will Karma does I
Know there's other people Mike exotic Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: comes on here You know, there's a there's
people come on here usually stand up to
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but it's there's not very many man
There's not very many You know Moscow can
[SPEAKER_00]: do it Moscow can do it real well Not many
people can
[SPEAKER_00]: How many land races do I think existed
Unknown quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Shit I Can't remember now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it the scientist or the chemist?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't fucking remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to find out exactly what it is What
was it was it the scientist I can't I
[SPEAKER_00]: think the chemist right I Want to say the
chemist this was a guy I want to say it
[SPEAKER_00]: was up north And yeah You know,
I've asked Canterado several times to come
[SPEAKER_00]: on live and he said he would but he hasn't
so hopefully we hopefully he will come on
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the chemist I Said scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I meant chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long fucking day long day the
chemist Yeah Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just tell the story one of our
friends bought Property after Tom's dad
[SPEAKER_00]: passed and I assume Okay, this is where
there's some assumptions though They
[SPEAKER_00]: brought property from a man who was known
as the chemist his family after he passed
[SPEAKER_00]: away When they were tearing down the
drywall and stuff They found a nice big
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking stash of seeds labeled from 1982
up till I can't remember what the last the
[SPEAKER_00]: most current one was but it was several
years ago And they were just stuffed in
[SPEAKER_00]: the wall and they're all labeled but
they're named labeled using Whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: notations he had so a lot of them are like
CCX whatever There's some of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled with China Creek or China creep or
China Creek I have I have pictures of all
[SPEAKER_00]: of them So we're just trying to figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just trying to figure it out I
didn't want to hit up Tom directly because
[SPEAKER_00]: he doesn't want people like hitting him
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think His name on here is not very
well known And I don't want to bug him and
[SPEAKER_00]: I also don't want him to say hey man,
that's mine That's mine, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so but I would really love to have him
involved with this I mean they technically
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's whoever bought the property
because they paid for everything on it And
[SPEAKER_00]: if that was in the wall meh Yeah crybaby
has been working with me on this really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard and he's done some amazing research
already already done some amazing research
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we want to get these figured out
and I think the only way to do it really
[SPEAKER_00]: Is gonna be with Tom's help like to get it
exactly right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's there's gonna be some cool
shit in there Looks like some cool shit
[SPEAKER_00]: right crybaby.
[SPEAKER_00]: He saw the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, a lot of notations the earliest
one was 1982 Yeah It's gonna be preserved
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about released it's at least
gonna be preserved Be preserved and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole point is preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like banking off of Tom Hill's
dad stuff That's not anyone's goal at all
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will be preserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely And I want to make sure that
this is even his dad but what if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: another dude known as a chemist,
you know Yeah, I don't know man Tom's
[SPEAKER_00]: never been nice to me Tom's never been
nice to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't quite say That he would be
honored to help anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah Yeah, exactly notations are very
confusing and that's why it's like one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those ones I was like CC I get DC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get CC CM You know, it's it's it's
pretty weird What happened to that crook
[SPEAKER_00]: rocket see I don't know I May have heard
some I'll tell you what I know and and
[SPEAKER_00]: what I know may not even be correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was called by somebody yesterday and
told that there may be Somehow that
[SPEAKER_00]: Crockett got fired over doing something
bad or incorrectly and I don't know who
[SPEAKER_00]: fired him I don't even know who would hire
Crockett in the first place, but they may
[SPEAKER_00]: have been fired I don't even know if it's
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not even crock and they might
have been referring to someone else But
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why I asked like I did I was like,
I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah Now my buddy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we got workman Just asked me a
question and I don't want to miss six at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why don't many folks read me?
[SPEAKER_00]: The original clone is still hard to find
the original clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of sour D crosses But most
of them aren't done with the clone My
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy karma does amazing work with sour D
his headbangers fucking top fucking notch
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want a good sour line I'm finishing
up a sour line right now using the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Think a lot of people do it's just it's
just trusting someone to have a legit sour
[SPEAKER_00]: line, you know But yeah, I see sour
constantly still They just found him with
[SPEAKER_00]: a jelly bean club You just gotta see
archive has a good sour too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure archives of Whatever but yeah,
he has a sour it's legit No sour is not
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim's skunk fa Kim 91 is not the same
thing
[SPEAKER_00]: According to Adam Dunst podcast everything
is Kim 91 But no, that is not how it works
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything good in that HSO am her sorry,
I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen that didn't know anything
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh No, I don't you want to watch drugs
ain't fuck Archives is shroomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the shroomy D which is also
known as original diesel in Sun circles Or
[SPEAKER_00]: Amish diesel as well Kind of coffee I'm
drinking area down a line coffee from
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I can't remember what the I one of my
friends in Hawaii sends me Some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: Kona, it's a pea berry from Kona that
lives out on the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trade him seats for this for the Kona So
it works out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind bartering for good coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drink a lot of coffee, but this is
actually Starbucks graham cracker flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: out of a fucking Keurig So, yeah Inbox you
my number, okay What is day wrecker is it
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to the original diesel Ah,
it just depends on who you ask man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't around in the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an east coaster So I couldn't tell
you what a legit day wrecker is versus a
[SPEAKER_00]: legit diesel Trusting there's just been so
many people who've claimed XYZ is original
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel, etc What is sprite again sprite is
the 10k back cross the 10k from green dot
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave that was Bodie's cut so it's very
very lemon lime
[SPEAKER_00]: Inbox my balls DM me your number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna send anyone my number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't I don't Not big on passing
out my phone number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get enough fucking fucked up calls just
from Other people passing it out You see
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the most popular breeder on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I know It's hard to imagine that
anybody could possibly dislike my ass But
[SPEAKER_00]: it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know must be something wrong with them
because I'm an amazing special man Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: nine seven six evil Good 315 CMH fixture
Solace tech for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love these ones man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rocking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loving them like it's too vigorous The
growth is way too vigorous now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's overly vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have too many fucking too much growth
too fast a legit agent orange Well agent
[SPEAKER_00]: orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be an alleged agent orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think a Legit agent orange agent
orange
[SPEAKER_00]: CMH's go up to a thousand watts now
[SPEAKER_00]: Correlations between frosty males and
progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's a that's one that's up for
debate Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna have to to say that there isn't
necessarily a correlation between every
[SPEAKER_00]: frosty male and progeny every single male
Not just from a single line like not all
[SPEAKER_00]: males from a single line breed the same
The correlation cannot be it just there's
[SPEAKER_00]: too many variables to answer that question
and you would never know until you ask
[SPEAKER_00]: Outcross it and see and that's that's the
best answer I can give you Outcross it run
[SPEAKER_00]: the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just There's there's no correlation
between frosty males and frosty progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is 100% of the time There may even be
a correlation between Frosty males and
[SPEAKER_00]: female dominance, but again not a hundred
percent of the time So it's really it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard to answer that question with
so many variables at play you might have a
[SPEAKER_00]: frosty male and a female that is Not so
resinous and actually male a male code
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant I want to say or male dominant
even though it's expressing is female and
[SPEAKER_00]: it would completely X out any kind of
female dominance in the progeny and either
[SPEAKER_00]: tilt it back to male dominance even or
Discount it both and go straight down the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's so much there's so much to that
and I am a frosty male Did you see Scott's
[SPEAKER_00]: miracle grows dude that was only a matter
of time before they bought sunlight supply
[SPEAKER_00]: the biggest the biggest players What do
you look for in progeny with breeding with
[SPEAKER_00]: oh gee, it just depends on the project man
depends on the project I don't just Chuck
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen and see what happens Do you think
breeders ever load their packs with femme
[SPEAKER_00]: and claim their regs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have three separate packs from Gromer
turnout to have 28 females two males
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled regular seeds I don't think any
breeder would make a Reverse line be and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff it in regular packs knowingly unless
I mean would intentionally make a reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: line and stuff it in packs like that
because it costs a shitload more to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse line not only in in electricity
but in space time amount of pollen you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get as many seeds, etc, but if
someone accidentally herm their plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: Sold those seeds it would still have a
female dominance with a high high
[SPEAKER_00]: probability of hermaphroditism in most
environments Easy stress response and that
[SPEAKER_00]: in that case you would still see a high
female dominance, but also a high herm
[SPEAKER_00]: dominance and Yeah that in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that would probably be The the
most likely candidate I mean, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: if that's what happened with him at all I
wouldn't I wouldn't claim to know but but
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that's in that situation That's
what you get if you were to open pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: the butters I'd have a whole lot of
variants of the babies and most which you
[SPEAKER_00]: would have already seen or worked
throughout the years the right bearing
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani correct correct correct
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes everything too dark It's getting
hard to read today and up for too long
[SPEAKER_00]: today I do like grumber grumber is a nice
guy And I've seen a lot of good stuff from
[SPEAKER_00]: his plants, you know a lot of its Mendo
breath crosses, but I mean if it's good is
[SPEAKER_00]: good, you know Where do you think the
peanut nose and p91 comes from?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a hard question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna say I'm gonna have to say it's
it's whatever Skunk or Afghani based skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: that they used every my guess
[SPEAKER_00]: Any info on compound genetics,
yeah good guys, they have a lot of really
[SPEAKER_00]: good cuts and They're doing some heavy
seed making projects as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding projects, but there's there's
some absolutely stellar progeny in those
[SPEAKER_00]: as well Nope never had the dumpster never
worked with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name just turned me off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like that like chemo I've had
it never worked for And It was just a name
[SPEAKER_00]: man, it was a big turn-off it was a big
turn-off Like I felt like if I smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: chemo, I'd all my hair would fall out and
I'd just be all weak and withered You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, that's one of those things Dr.
Candyman Lloyd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Candyman had some he was and he
declared himself the King Paul and Chuck
[SPEAKER_00]: her But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: He had some badass shit back in the day
badass shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was an excellent strain collector and
He you know, he was doing better work than
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of breeders who were trying to do
selections and and I think that that
[SPEAKER_00]: happens a lot when people know good weed
and They're good at selecting a male and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can still get some excellent progeny
that way I could think of a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: instances of people out out How would I
put this making better progeny than
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders who call themselves readers doing
selections, you know I mean like It
[SPEAKER_00]: happens a lot and in that case Lloyd was
doing that back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had some fucking rad shit you I would
say he had as much rad shit as Elite
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics did back in the day not to be
confused with elite cannabis elite
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics Yeah, he was killing it and and
and not as well known But god damn he did
[SPEAKER_00]: some cool shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus he's he's a fucking a black guy who's
a Satanist I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about punk rock is that shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I Just got in some compound the other day
What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a jet fuel jet fuel gelato process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the jet fuel gelato s ones going and
It was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a white sherb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think gelat jet fuel gelato looking
forward to that Sounds fucking cool
[SPEAKER_00]: P91 cross to the butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't have the p91 cut anymore I
would have to select from the s ones and I
[SPEAKER_00]: have so much so many other projects going
out probably Not gonna rework any p91.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just leave that up to everyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Barbara Bush is dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Aren't we sad a fucking Bush is dead a
Lot of fucking snakes came out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: crotch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you what I can't wait to see

strains that you do like basically some
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that you do like that you like to
smoke and then they tell me that then I
[SPEAKER_00]: can make a Basis off of how certain

[SPEAKER_00]: you know Thank You Redwood, thank you
Pacific Let's see Did I do the giveaway
[SPEAKER_00]: from last night yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I always leave that up to Brynn
whenever she finally does the drawing
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll know who won Meth head slut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's next after coke head slut
because there is a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: variance, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: usually coke head sluts are rich rich
girls or Girls from better off situations
[SPEAKER_00]: that that go on bad coke runs and end up
sucking everyone's dick and fucking dudes
[SPEAKER_00]: for coke, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But meth head sluts usually are already
white trash and they get into it and they
[SPEAKER_00]: never had a chance So that's usually how
it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually you do coke head sluts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't dip down to meth They just stay on
coke or crack but meth head sluts that
[SPEAKER_00]: people they're already on meth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fucked anyways Call it
administrative assistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Can you flower under CMH three?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course Meth breath Lines of yours
go with what type of height?
[SPEAKER_00]: I Miss something Here one of sucks
Everyone is a fucking shitty shitty line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not lying.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a shitty line.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people were conned into thinking
Caruana was this fucking crazy potent
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks man shit sucks ass All of all of
the strawberry lines extract very well all
[SPEAKER_00]: of them all of them Yes 420 666 written
like that Freeze land indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: See I say it's a booth, but my friend up
in Canada loves it track inspector loves
[SPEAKER_00]: the fucking freeze land But it's just not
my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it got passed down here from
Canada and it was Canadian Beasters
[SPEAKER_00]: Strongest highest yield Lord Like just
like all the other questions people are
[SPEAKER_00]: asking depends on how you grow depends on
your body Chemistry what is potent to you
[SPEAKER_00]: might not be potent to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's put in me and I might not be potent
to you That's a really hard one as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest yielding a lot of the strawberry
cream baselines are good Yielders,
[SPEAKER_00]: however depends on how you grow man I
don't like telling people you can get big
[SPEAKER_00]: yields if they suck at growing,
you know And at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like telling they're gonna get
quality if they suck at growing and make
[SPEAKER_00]: everything beastie yields The last thing
you should be worrying about is yields
[SPEAKER_00]: first thing you should be worried about is
quality
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have some of the old Oguana Kush
from motor of all the og Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the original seeds of that I wasn't
a fan man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that leathery Smell of of
heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not appealing to me Yeah,
not my thing oh So the next The next if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting two to three pounds of
light, I mean I Depends on your growing
[SPEAKER_00]: style again But I can pull that with blue
geranium and it's just still wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: that great of quality Just because you're
pushing it so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should never push a strain You should
never use bloom boosters if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: quality because you're you're redirecting
the energy of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: I Have not smelled the hairy that smells
like peanuts absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sure haven't What strain of mine will
break a carbon filter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani heirloom Skunk spray can any of
those are fucking stinky as fuck man
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality over quantity any day any day of
the week, and I don't think most people
[SPEAKER_00]: will ever understand that See and motor
rebel pushed out harawana for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: He based it off of Chris woodhorses line.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I don't think it was I think he
crossed something in if I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly If I remember correctly he
crossed something different in and it came
[SPEAKER_00]: out completely different Whereas the
original harawana from Steve Tuck wood
[SPEAKER_00]: horse that that long Line was more of an
Afghani base and motor rebels is just like
[SPEAKER_00]: very narrow leaf It's not anything
reminiscent of the original
[SPEAKER_00]: Here wanted Jack 33 it sounds like a sandy
line Is there any negative side effects to
[SPEAKER_00]: reversing a plant outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really other than I don't outdoor
breeding is not ideal anywhere Because
[SPEAKER_00]: cross contamination becomes a big reality
when you start fucking with shit outdoors
[SPEAKER_00]: Always because you never know who's
growing outdoors around you Unless you
[SPEAKER_00]: know all your neighbors and shit,
but I mean even then pollen could travel
[SPEAKER_00]: over a mile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So That's that's the biggest problem and
seeding your neighbors plants because
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll fucking hate you forever if they
find out you did that Do you think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: possible there's still a true cut of UBC
chemo?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh sure I have a lot of early UBC chemo
crosses still too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm sure they've The original
cuts got to be out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was passed around a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't too rare Again groovy weed in my
line awesome groovy feeling it depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: your body chemistry a lot of people like
Urkel because it relaxes them and Urkel
[SPEAKER_00]: freaks me out and makes me question
everything about every decision I've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: made and hate life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's again It's not something that if
someone like if you go in a collective and
[SPEAKER_00]: someone tells you How this weed is gonna
make you feel they're fucking lying to you
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not how weed works and anybody who
smokes any amount of weed For any period
[SPEAKER_00]: of time should be able to figure that out
pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Have no idea who garrison lane is don't
know who Billy Kimber OG is I don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: wide lexicon of Of new pollen suckers,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't keep up with anything like that
And even but you know what like even with
[SPEAKER_00]: friends of mine like someone just asked
about professor P was string currently
[SPEAKER_00]: going I have no idea what he's working on
and it's not out of disrespect for him
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that I don't care about his lines
I'm working on my own shit and it's like I
[SPEAKER_00]: just have my head down working,
you know That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Just got him longer you've been in the
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you As far as like Breeding and
selling seeds publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at 13 years now 12 and a half 13
years I always say 13 because it sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler, but it's more like 12 and a half
As far as growing and shit since I was
[SPEAKER_00]: young man since I was young I mean I I
used to water my dad's plants that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really count for growing because I hated
doing it But it's been on and off most of
[SPEAKER_00]: my life You know the potency and breeding
potential of Neville Hayes Neville's Hayes
[SPEAKER_00]: is a beautiful line not every No is
beautiful, which means that the
[SPEAKER_00]: out-crosses are gonna be wide and varied
However, if someone were to take a Nell's
[SPEAKER_00]: line that was extremely good work it keep
selecting towards that line awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely awesome I just I'm gonna be
popping some new a new sour line as we
[SPEAKER_00]: speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So After the all this bullshit goes on
Just harvested some of the seeds and they
[SPEAKER_00]: look good There's a lot of potential in
the cross However, you never know till you
[SPEAKER_00]: run them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those won't be available for quite a
while, but Yeah, there's some some legit
[SPEAKER_00]: sour D crosses going on and it might have
something to do with something Something
[SPEAKER_00]: sure be maybe I don't know got to make
lines that appeal to everyone and and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, it makes some good shit Yeah,
you better for some On you better force
[SPEAKER_00]: him on It takes forever to come on last
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came on when I had like two seconds
left old man Loomx needs to come through
[SPEAKER_00]: Did these glasses make me look smart I
think they make me look smarter and sexier
[SPEAKER_00]: and sexier What do I do with leftovers
after I harvest my seeds I usually throw
[SPEAKER_00]: it in the freezer and never touch it again
But I will be smashing it soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to go through Yeah, so I mean for a
while when I would be low on weed I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it just because it was good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just had been seeded Yeah, yeah we
brought that up earlier about sunlight
[SPEAKER_00]: supply and Scott's miracle grow no real
surprise there no real surprise there The
[SPEAKER_00]: average time to bring that line public so
like if let's say everything lines up
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly, let's say I did a good
selection the progeny show good favorable
[SPEAKER_00]: results that like I see shit that I like
and I know other people would like and All
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit Is a finite loop had been
finicky, yeah Not too terribly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I remember the first time I grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was a lot I just wasn't as good
at growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh geez, but for a line to be finished
Spect at least a year year and a half and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's if everything goes everything Goes
right Do you think affects with taste?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think affects the taste with
fertilized buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what that means I'd have to
reword that Smart as the new gangster very
[SPEAKER_00]: true except that I'll suck you in your
fucking mouth, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Could recite cannabis genetics and I'll
punch you in your fucking face Doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean that I'll beat your ass, but I
goddamn will fucking try Damn will try I
[SPEAKER_00]: have no edit button with my mouth or my Or
my kicks or punches.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the way it is But I grew up in
a fucking blue-collar town, man I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's normal for everyone around here and
it's not normal for people in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: other cities It's we are town even our
punk rock scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a horrible reputation for being
violent.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, there's a new
documentary The new documentary coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's called bones of Brundage and
They did a documentary on Bakersfield punk
[SPEAKER_00]: rock and the violence and all the fucked
up shit in our scene that's happened over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years So yeah, if you see that coming
out check it out the bones of Brundage I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course, I'm gonna push it cuz
that's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's uh, it's all about the
history of punk rock in Bakersfield which
[SPEAKER_00]: was funny flying swordsman came on and
told me that uh, what did you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally not punk rock or some stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like what this this is fucking
motherfucker Posting about Grateful Dead's
[SPEAKER_00]: records on his page is fucking talking
about being not being punk rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the fuck out of here This shit's in my
blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just is what it is I hope it'll be on
Netflix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure but You can see it on
Facebook or if you go I know it's on It's
[SPEAKER_00]: on a lot of different things If you if you
want, I'll send you a link so you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: the the trailer man It's just some of it
but you know, it's It's a lot about how
[SPEAKER_00]: like during a certain era of Bakersfield
the early 2000s late 90s how everyone that
[SPEAKER_00]: was around during that era We all knew
each other because Bakersfield is not
[SPEAKER_00]: terribly It's not terribly big especially
the punk rock scene was much smaller and
[SPEAKER_00]: we all knew each other and it was kind of
about how from this small group What
[SPEAKER_00]: happened and how it all fell apart and how
we all ended up, you know Most of us are
[SPEAKER_00]: dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of our friends are dead Or you'll see
a lot of them that are homeless in the
[SPEAKER_00]: documentary Guys that were front men one
of the guys that was a front man in one of
[SPEAKER_00]: my band He's a fucking disaster fucking
disaster now He just slurs and mumbles And
[SPEAKER_00]: grumbles and it used to be a funny dude
used to used to be punk as fuck and now he
[SPEAKER_00]: is a wipeout You know, it's a lot about
that Yeah Not many people made it out and
[SPEAKER_00]: were successful It was a fucking wild
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good time but you know,
I mean Everything's awesome when you're on
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs until drugs take over and you're
fucked, you know You don't you don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: out of doing hard drugs Untouched it'll
affect your life in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will absolutely affect your life in
some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow organic and I Grow synthetic It's a
hybrid style of growing and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever works best and the most effective
and I find that Not being strictly one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing or another being able to move fluid
You know with what you got and being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to move fluid based on the strain Is is
the best way for me to grow I can adapt To
[SPEAKER_00]: all of it and that's that's what works
best for me I see people kick my ass and
[SPEAKER_00]: growing with organic and I've seen people
kick my ass with growing and synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, definitely not the best but but it's
all about being fluid You lots I hear one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the punk scene I've been through it
lived it somehow made it out the other end
[SPEAKER_00]: though I'm pretty vocal about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't care I like to be able to
talk about my past when it comes to all
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs because I know A lot of other people
have been through what I've been through
[SPEAKER_00]: and in cannabis people are so fucking
judgmental So goddamn judgmental and
[SPEAKER_00]: people should be able to talk about their
experiences be able to relate with people
[SPEAKER_00]: To and and you should be able to inspire
people who are going through that shit You
[SPEAKER_00]: know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to talk, you know say I
made it through this you can too That's it
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds silly and it sounds obvious But
it's not in our scene and in even though
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis whether people ever want it I
don't know why people say it's not a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fucking drug Alcohol is a drug
anything that alters your mind state is a
[SPEAKER_00]: drug You know, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying one is worse than the other
Obviously some are worse than the other
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't think cannabis is the worst by
any means but it is a drug So for people
[SPEAKER_00]: to be so judgmental about other people and
the lives they're living or have lived
[SPEAKER_00]: When they smoke pot, that's so ironic so
ironic And to this day dude, like if when
[SPEAKER_00]: people want to insult me, they'll call me
a bitch They'll call me a fucking junkie
[SPEAKER_00]: because they know that's my past and the
the quickest way to insult someone that's
[SPEAKER_00]: ever had a really bad drug past is To call
them a current junkie and it's real easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that It's real easy to insult people
like that, but I don't get hurt by it
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've seen the good that it's done
by me talking about my past with heroin
[SPEAKER_00]: and methadone and all that shit and I've
seen how many people pop up and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: will message me and say me too me too I
think you know So that's the only reason I
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only reason I talk about it
because people should be able to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about their shit, you know without feeling

my lymph nodes drained and Be stuffed with
[SPEAKER_00]: gauze and pull the gauze out of myself six
feet of it Twice a day for months until it
[SPEAKER_00]: finally healed and sealed itself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I've been there too Do I
