[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: The subject for today is going to be Eric
from HBK Farms gonna come talk with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's one of my old friends and he's been
around forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's made some killer strains,
won some awards, done some cool shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna bring him on.
[SPEAKER_02]: What am I smoking on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Professor P sent me some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been smoking on some blue power from
a buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see how we're doing on volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the haps, amigo?
[SPEAKER_00]: How goes it?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's the connection there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it's good so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that couch chair you're on?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a rocking chair.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Lord.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to chill while you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a little bit, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Waiting for HBK right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for everyone just coming in,
we're gonna have on HBK Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's an old friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been in the scene forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Won awards at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first met him, he was making a
killer, killer topical.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the best, and he won many awards
for his topicals as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the most, one of the best and
most effective CBD creams that were at the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if he still does it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he put a pause on it for a while,
but he was winning awards and one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: earliest guys to be doing stuff like that
and really make effective CBD cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be bringing him on tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if he's in here yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: HBK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any HBKs in here?
[SPEAKER_02]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Invite.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he should be joining us in a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's still your pop pops lazy boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's going on guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry for the smoky screen, but my phone's
kind of a piece of crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as we can hear you, we're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be sure to speak up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who is HBK Farms and where are you
from, brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: Originally Southern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in San Diego on the border East
County.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Campo area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for the last 25, 30 years,
I've been in central Valley near Fresno.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for the last 10 years,
I spent half the year in Southern Humboldt
[SPEAKER_01]: and half the year down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you started HBK Farms,
was that when you were in San Diego or was
[SPEAKER_02]: that when you moved up to the central
Valley?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, central Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really brand myself until God,
almost like 2014, 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was when I got online and started
talking to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized I needed a name and I was
trying to get into the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I came over HBK.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was actually a name that came up
prior when I was playing paintball back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the day, actually kind of before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just for half-baked kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what it's for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that until right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a foreman at one point and he didn't
really like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he used to always be like,
oh, that stoner guy, he's fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: half-baked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just kind of stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I was playing paintball for
about 10 years, I was doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: tournament level ball and we started from
teams and yeah, half-baked was the name of
[SPEAKER_01]: our team.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even know that all these years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were you smoking in San Diego?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what years in San Diego were you
puffing back in San Diego when you were
[SPEAKER_02]: there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew up in the East County and I
think when I was in about 10th grade,
[SPEAKER_01]: I started smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of stuff did you see around
then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Brick weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Experience of the brick weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every great once in a while we
would see some kind bud come through and
[SPEAKER_01]: that was usually we'd have to go down into
like El Cajon or maybe like Mission Beach,
[SPEAKER_01]: track that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was so expensive back then that I
couldn't like, that's why I started
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad was a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was kind of a hobbyist grower when I
was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his best friend who lived on our
property was like a legit grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a griller grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I started growing,
my dad kind of shut me down real quick,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then Darryl, my dad's best friend took
me under his wing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there were some other people in
our town that were pretty heavy growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I learned pretty early on
that would have been like 89, 88,
[SPEAKER_01]: 89.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 90, 91, I was already producing
seeds because back then we couldn't find
[SPEAKER_01]: any seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got lucky and had some pretty good
strains and was already finding some
[SPEAKER_01]: males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started making seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had growing up on the border in
Tecate, I grew up with kids that parents
[SPEAKER_01]: were cartel growers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like, can you get a seed,
like bags of seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I realized that it was easier to
grow seed for sale and not risk as much
[SPEAKER_01]: than trying to grow pounds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what I started doing early
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I took a break from like 97,
98 to 2004, five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a daughter and my life changed and
kind of got out of it for a little while
[SPEAKER_01]: and then came back and been here ever
since.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you, when I first met you,
you were heavy, heavy, heavy into the
[SPEAKER_02]: topical scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember like our first exchange,
you gave me some of your cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, hey, try it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like real generous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew it sold for good money,
but you gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tried so many different creams over
the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really genuinely dismissed every
cream that I tried after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I tried yours and handed it off
to my chick and my mom at the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were blown away, absolutely blown
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you started winning some big awards
for your work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell us how you got into that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very interested in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my daughter, when she was born,
she was born with a rare skin condition
[SPEAKER_01]: called epidermolysis bullosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, so they're missing a skin
tissue layer and called the butterfly
[SPEAKER_01]: disease, I think is what they call it or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of like being burned every
day without being burned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so blisters sores, the blisters,
once they start, they don't stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just keep like, she would get a
little blister on her knuckle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the next morning, it would take up
her whole hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd have to stop, you'd have to
lance it to stop it, which you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to do, but because of the tissue
layer issue, she would get these
[SPEAKER_01]: infections.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 96, 95, 96, there were some local
hippies a lady named Marion, who was one
[SPEAKER_01]: of my elementary teachers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her husband were holistic old school
hippie growers at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was like, oh, you know,
you got to make these cannabis salve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he started keeping me about cannabis
salves and creams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then God, I kind of dabbled around
with it for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when I came back into crowing
again, I started trying to pick it up,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I wasn't getting the effects that I
really wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't really working for her.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I came across CBD and him and
working with Ringo Lawrence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, Hey, you know,
we've got this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a friend that's making these
creams and it's really helping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I got into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I just decided I'm going to make
a good cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I wanted something that
just with my daughter's skin condition,
[SPEAKER_01]: it couldn't be too greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It couldn't get oily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it couldn't be too rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the people that were making
cannabis salve or balms, it was like
[SPEAKER_01]: beeswax and, and coconut oil and ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just made her skin problem worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I came up to the cocoa cream,
seven ingredients, and it started working
[SPEAKER_01]: for her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started kind of selling it on the
side a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started getting instant feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was like, dude, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I started getting it on the
market and I started winning awards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the CBD craze hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden it went from like 10
or 20 of us that were making CBD creams or
[SPEAKER_01]: topicals to like thousands and big
companies that were like dumping shit on
[SPEAKER_01]: the market and garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden I went from everybody
being like, Oh, wow, who are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's this to all of a sudden everybody's
like, Oh, you're a CBD company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back down for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of just kept it available for
people who wanted it and needed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I stopped trying to go big with it
because I didn't have a million dollars to
[SPEAKER_01]: go up against these CBD companies that
started coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I still make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have it available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't market it like I used to
because it's just the people who know know
[SPEAKER_01]: and anybody that wants to know,
it's still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like it's people that understand,
like with that market, there was only a
[SPEAKER_02]: few people that were doing it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like really right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when CBD hit big and the farm bill
passed and shit, like people started
[SPEAKER_02]: licensing hemp products from China and
they are paid to grow hemp over there to
[SPEAKER_02]: leach toxins from the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's used to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they know they can pass that off
cheaply, super cheap on dumbass Americans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that pretty much wrecked the whole
industry for the few people who were doing
[SPEAKER_02]: this shit right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you see it in gas stations
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know how it's sourced.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know how it's made and there's
no regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nobody gives a fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those things that people don't
seem to know very much about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I went fully legal, it seems to me
like all those products you were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, most of them don't have like the
amount you would want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to splash CBD cream or lip
balm or this or that or whatever or gels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't really have a bunch of
science behind what actually works.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was thinking when you were talking
about all that stuff is like how
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting like your weed path is because
most people who start making seeds have
[SPEAKER_00]: been growing flour for a while before they
get like the know how and the knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: and the itch to make, you know,
to like sell seed, not to like make seed
[SPEAKER_00]: every year to grow flour, but actually to
like sell seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to get into cream, cream has got
to be one of the rarest things that
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody ever figured out how to do like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like pretty much nobody was nobody was
really making that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't common.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never met anyone really.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, and because I was dedicated
to making seed, I didn't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a lot of byproduct from the
plant that I was breaking down for the
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, what am I going to do with
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's make hash or let's like,
let's figure out what we're going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's make edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't a good edible maker and it wasn't
a great, great hash maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't have a lot of material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the topicals were like instantly
all just fell into place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, those are the two things I
focused on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was, it was wild times and,
and I'm glad to hear you're still making
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know like instantly everybody in
chat was like, where do we buy it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it available on a website?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it available on a website anywhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my own website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's www.hbktopicals.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to pin it in the, in the chat
room so people can see it while we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing this and go grab it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I'm there in very few things that
I will put my name behind, but the Eric's
[SPEAKER_02]: topicals have been always, always been
awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always, always been awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Checking it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the cocoa cream, which is designed
for skin restoration or skin condition
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works great for like bug bites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Takes the itch away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I also have a cinnamon fire bomb,
which is based off of like a traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: tiger bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's for muscle ligament.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a menthol type based smells
like cinnamon fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have tinctures up from time to time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been trying to get the chapsticks
back, but I just haven't had the money for
[SPEAKER_01]: the labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My girlfriend loved the chapstick.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one she likes the most is the
chapstick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, the chapsticks were like a big thing
for a long time when I was doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sell out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go through like 500 containers and
every year people would go back over the
[SPEAKER_01]: booth and pull their stick out and be
like, Oh, this is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's cause it's like super,
it's affordable and it's, it's something
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody can afford, but it's highly
effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, you know, so people are
going to want me to ask more about Ringo
[SPEAKER_02]: and your interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know Ringo, so I didn't have any
interactions with him or his crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk about them a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew Ringo kind of, um, I would go up
and see him every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had kind of like a phone conversation,
um, relationship in 2010 or 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember when it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't doing too well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I decided I was going to leave the Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to move to Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went up there looking for work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like I got lauded in with all
the immigrants and the homeless people and
[SPEAKER_01]: this dude pulled in, you know,
and I kind of looked at him and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, I wonder if this guy can help me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I walked over, started talking to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of took a bond and he's like,
Hey, you know, I got some work,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you can move some units for me,
I'm like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I started talking with him
and kind of formed a bond and I would just
[SPEAKER_01]: call him and go up and see him every now
and then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when the CBD thing for him,
he was kind of like the Godfather of the
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then he got sick and passed away
before I could really get the chance to
[SPEAKER_01]: spend a lot of time with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we were doing a little bit of CBD
breeding work when I was doing all that
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Testing for Jaime with the, well,
I wasn't really doing testing for Jaime.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of the early can of tonic
feeds and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when Ringo had all his Sue lines,
I started going through those and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and then we started working on the
lavender project and then, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: he passed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tried to reach out to his kids,
but his kids didn't really know me and
[SPEAKER_01]: they were doing their own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, it just kind of lost track
of all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, I'm not sure if any of
his lines are still around from the
[SPEAKER_01]: family, if they're still focusing on any
of that or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: His daughter, Danielle and Levi were the
ones that kind of took over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they still have some stuff going
on, but I'm not sure, but I still see
[SPEAKER_01]: Harle Sue crosses everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's his legacy that'll live on
forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get to work with some of those
guys who are maybe like underground,
[SPEAKER_02]: like legends like that, you know,
you get to just briefly rub elbows with
[SPEAKER_02]: them and have some of their magic rub off
on you a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's special stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like he was a special dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the one that got me to like start
growing again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was still kind of like, Oh,
I'll grow a couple little plants in my
[SPEAKER_01]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, no, man, you know,
like you live in a great area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go incognito, like, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, okay, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I miss that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was, he was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a lot of great stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew a lot of really big plants and
yeah, I miss him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have anything you want to ask Natsa?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the, the weird idea, I was just
thinking about like the whole,
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole CBD thing, because I think like,
for the probably the first 20 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: for most people, when they first
encountered CBD, like they didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they felt like it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I come from the Midwest, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used to get really beautiful ditch
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we call it pretendica and it
would look like unbelievably juicy,
[SPEAKER_00]: so much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were talking about Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all started on, you know, there was two
kinds of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was brown Mexican and green Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every once in a while you'd find
kind of, but then sometimes people would
[SPEAKER_00]: take that, that gorgeous weed and dry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would look so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd spend all this money and we'd
smoke and smoke and smoke and smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, oh, I'm like, man, I'm not
getting high, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just interesting how like,
how for a long time we had like this
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with hemp and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went like 50, 60 years with
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even a lot of, even a lot of like,
you know, like people on the THC side that
[SPEAKER_00]: are pretty knowledgeable, like you know,
CBD is supposed to do, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, everything from like miracle cures
to like make nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really odd in that regard,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it's kind of like,
and it's, I think it's kind of like in its
[SPEAKER_00]: infancy and it seems like it got all big,
all quick, like you were saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all these sharks jumped in and kind
of like diluted is really what I,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just, well, yeah, everyone just
jumped in and nobody knew anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get to sell something cool
and holistic to people that don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: anything and they don't know how much dose
is supposed to be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what an effective dose is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's kind of like, yeah,
it's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that like, as soon as it went legal,
it like got doused in a sea of like
[SPEAKER_00]: ineffective CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference between the textile hemp
style plants that are more for fiber,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is also carries some CBD,
which is hemp versus the more traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: like CBD lines that we know now,
like Kanatonic, there was a big
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first started smoking some of
the early Kanatonic, I picked up on a
[SPEAKER_01]: euphoric feeling from it and I was like,
Oh yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we made the creams for it,
I made some really hot batches and I could
[SPEAKER_01]: feel my hands getting numb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've gotten, I've gotten
textiles type hemp extraction and try to
[SPEAKER_01]: use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's completely useless.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's interesting about that is
like Kanatonic and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like there's a, there's not that
much CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like bread from drug cultivars
towards the CBD side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what I was getting on
what you were saying is like Kanatonic was
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of bread from smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not from the other side of like hemp fiber
or anything like that, which might have a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you remember when Jaime first sent
those tester seeds out, like we didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: know it was a CBD line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just Kanatonic and they just made
the cry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't ever advertised.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't breed it as a CBD line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just ended up that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the genetics behind
Kanatonic, you would think, Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is going to be some fire weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like bomb THC weed because it's the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, you know, it's primarily CBD
only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when I was going through all those
packs and I was having them tested,
[SPEAKER_01]: I found one phenol that was a primarily
THC carrier phenol.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a 14 or 16% THC with very
little THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still one of my favorite plants
that I ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like real cheesy and it got me so
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I was, doing that work with
plant speaker Jay, I lost that cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to get it to Jay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I was gone up there,
I lost that cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some very rare THC phenols
of Kanatonic out there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I think it's funny because a lot
of people weren't around when Resin Seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: came out and all of them, I remember they
had the fake HB 13 sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I remember thinking, fuck, they got the
sour pussy and they're selling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to try that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turned out not to be anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they admitted it later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, yeah, this isn't what we
thought it was, which is cool of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a Kanatonic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when that came out too,
and it was not a CBD line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like what?
[SPEAKER_02]: MKUltra G13 Haze?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yup.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was probably, honestly, in the
Prohibition days, there was probably an
[SPEAKER_00]: enormous amount of CBD in various cannabis
strains that got selected away from
[SPEAKER_00]: because we weren't, we were only testing
by smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're passing around different
phenotypes and your friends are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, that one, I don't think, let's go with
this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because without testing, it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that's one to one, like 10,
12% THC and 10, 12% CBD or something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's high in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When was the first time you saw results,
like actual testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you remember?
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have been 2011.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say like 11,
12, somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what you guys are saying is
that we've had testing for a little longer
[SPEAKER_00]: than a decade, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it's like before that, like we
really weren't able to select for CBD very
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I got my first few tests that
came back, I was hooked on getting tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember Matt, I was just like every week
I was like testing, testing, testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all my money on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so fucking expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back then too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember every time I'm like,
how does he fucking afford to test all
[SPEAKER_02]: this shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't test one thing and he's like
fucking 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing literally like between two and
$5,000 every other week on testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: just trying to go through all these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I gained a lot of respect
early on because I was actually doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: work to find these, these cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You for sure were, you were doing real
testing at a time when it was totally just
[SPEAKER_02]: not advantageous financially to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, it was very, very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very cool to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And luckily you used some of my shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, yeah, I could see the test
with some of my shit too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm cheap fellas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's, let's talk about some of these
strains you've seen over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the ones you've worked with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was one of some of the first strains
you were crossing at HBK?
[SPEAKER_01]: At HBK or the first strains I was
crossing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned that you were crossing like
different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like different Mexicans, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: At the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing just like, like the very first
stuff was just like some regular old brick
[SPEAKER_01]: wheat seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was some, a guy in Pine
Valley that I was growing up with named
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Ballman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like going out and finding all
the time, but he was a trust fund kid and
[SPEAKER_01]: he had the money and he was bringing all
this weed back and he was getting really
[SPEAKER_01]: good bag feed and he was collecting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was giving me some of that and I
was popping those and out of those,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had gotten this purple hair octane.
[SPEAKER_01]: These little short plants, super dark
purple hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my buddies in the area in Campo there
were like, damn, like that's bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one of our friends in the
neighborhood, that hippie couple,
[SPEAKER_01]: they traveled to Amsterdam, met up with
Neville, brought back most of his seed
[SPEAKER_01]: bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was in, I want to say my daughter
wasn't born yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would have been 390.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before they brought back a bunch of
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my best friend, Jeff at the time was
working with these people and he pulled a
[SPEAKER_01]: few cuts away from them and then got a few
seeds from them after they had made some
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I was working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was another guy over in
Barona by the Indian reservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were working with some Jamaicans,
Jamaican lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got a little bit of that and that's
what I was working with early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when my wife at the time got
busted for international trafficking,
[SPEAKER_01]: we lost everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We moved and then I had to start over
again in mid 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in mid 2000, when you started working
with making strains again, what were you
[SPEAKER_02]: growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: What were some of your selection criteria?
[SPEAKER_01]: The first few things I started working
with was I was moving some weight for some
[SPEAKER_01]: mom growers in the valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got some heated pounds of some
really great weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I then got some bag seed from some
kids that I was playing paintball with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I was making that candy,
candy crack is what I was calling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ran that for a long time for two
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got into the CBD thing hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was running some of your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been asking about that candy
crack in the comments repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was something that is kind of this
convoluted, fucked up story that I got
[SPEAKER_01]: tired of arguing with everybody about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made that stuff back in 2005 or 2006 of
dumping clones to some kids in San Jose
[SPEAKER_01]: that were distributing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't realize what it really was
until about 2014 when I started seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the flower come back and
everybody's like, yeah, it's crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, I think that's my
strain, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I reached out to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it kind of came up with the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then later on, God, like 2018 or 19,
Kevin started phylosing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I threw in a phylose run and it
came back as green ribbon, but also green
[SPEAKER_01]: crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was also related to spunk, hemp,
Colombian gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dream queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't fucking know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I honestly don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kind of was like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it is, it is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I knew I had some really
good stuff, but it was such a small run
[SPEAKER_01]: and I wasn't really shooting for anything
at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it turned out to be a bitch and
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it phyloses back to a bunch of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, phylose is a tough one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like their results were so inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some of the times I'd see them and
I'd be like, okay, that makes sense
[SPEAKER_02]: genetically, this related to that,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go and see like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, let's say someone submitted a
bubba Mendo perps and then they submitted
[SPEAKER_02]: bubba and then they submitted Mendo perps
that they made it with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden it's like,
oh, none of these are related.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I kind of just stopped arguing
that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the next thing that came up was
the chili verde.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chili verde was part of the lavender
project with Ringo.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ringo had called me one night and he's
like, hey, he's like, you're running that
[SPEAKER_01]: lavender, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, I've gotten a cut here
locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like the San Jose cut or whatever
it was, the lavender that everybody had in
[SPEAKER_01]: mid 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little short, stocky,
super dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it the early lavender?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, hey, he's like,
I got all these seeds that I bought from
[SPEAKER_01]: Stoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, I don't want to work this project
to get straight lavender, but he's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I give you the seeds and go through it,
can you come up with something?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said that he had a mail already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went up, got the seeds, got the mail,
got some more lavender cuts from him,
[SPEAKER_01]: brought them all back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started trying to make, cause he
wanted straight lavender.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I made the straight lavender.
[SPEAKER_01]: But while I was doing that, I had a whole
depth full of other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hit it to eline pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit it to Girl Scout.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit it to pineapple cheese from Ringo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit it to a Harlestoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit it to a, what was the other one?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Kraft baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, oh, the green candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was another one that I did and
harvested all that stuff, took all the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds back up to Ringo, gave them to him,
and then he passed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next season was a year when
those kids ripped me off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that stock got all that breeder
stock from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I lost the lavender stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept one little, I had one little shitty
clone left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but I had all the other seeds and
then I started dropping those chili
[SPEAKER_01]: birdies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I dropped the chili birdie,
I got kind of a lot of pushback.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were actually talking shit to me
when I dropped them and they were like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you use key lime pie?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, that is the shittiest
fucking plant in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, I liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was okay.
You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: None of them had even tried it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the fucked part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was, it was in so few hands at the
time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I didn't, I kind of perceived it
as, oh, well maybe I made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I didn't really push it that hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sold some packs and then kind of
just set it aside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two or like two years later,
two years later, popped a few more seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and I had A through F cuts is what I was
calling them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was hanging out with John and we
were doing the breeder series.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I took a bunch, I took some cuts up
with me and I was like, John, like check
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he looked at the flower and he was
like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like key lime pie lavender.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, like, this is legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, do you have cuts in this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought you one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, he's like, man,
he's like, we're going to do some stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, we've got something here,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, you're on to something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was when I met not so dog,
I think at the same exact event.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a nice cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to, I grew that cut that you gave
him multiple years in Greenland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was, I liked it sun grown quite
a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that the, was that the, the super
Verde cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had this chili.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have pictures of it on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did probably a couple of years in a
row, probably half of like a 30 by a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred greenhouse of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one when Eric first brought it
up, it smelled like, it smelled like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it smelled like, to a T chili Verde,
like just wildest greasy meat,
[SPEAKER_02]: chili Verde smell that I loved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does kind of seem to like that weed
came out like a few years before the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the like modern purple wave sort of
swamped everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really was like purple had
not been popular for the most part for
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it, it, it was one of the
first cuts I remember seeing that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of started that wave like
that and the gelato and different things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, but it reminded me it definitely,
you can definitely taste the lavender in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, you know, but I think it's
maybe a little bit more potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cut that Matt's referring to is one
of the other cuts that I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more of that straight chili.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the super chili, which was coined by
Lion Bolt, I think, which is the D cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the cut that I gave John,
the one that won the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one was heavy lavender.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really gravy, but it still had like
this OG overtone to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really different than the cut that
I smelled from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like the one I smelled from you
smelled like meat, like chili Verde on the
[SPEAKER_02]: barbecue is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one I had was sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much sweeter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one, the one that, that won the
Emerald Cup was the one, the reason I gave
[SPEAKER_01]: it out was because it had better
uniformity looking structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had more tighter nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a little bit easier to run in
depth or outdoor, but it was really
[SPEAKER_01]: finicky indoors, especially if you were
running the old school shitty LED,
[SPEAKER_01]: the pink ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fucking does not like those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like chili just doesn't like LEDs for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure why, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those were the two that I had a couple
different cuts and then John had the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cut got out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got two or three different people and then
yeah, it took off and it won.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was a little bummed because I wasn't
in a position to be able to capitalize on
[SPEAKER_01]: getting cuts out to the population when it
won.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other people instantly jumped on it
and made a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just like, Hey, fuck,
you know, how am I going to deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: this?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I, how do I direct this in my
direction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll start dropping seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I got seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't have cuts, but I got seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I kind of tried to stay on top of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, still kind of pushing that run.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's turned out to be a really
good breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten up into the F5, F6s now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the last batch of chili crosses
that I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did like, I think it was seven crosses
with an F5 and they turned out phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single jar you open is just so bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bitching color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you get that red from the hairs and
the purples and some of the greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of did some hypey crosses a
couple of years ago before I went to work
[SPEAKER_01]: for Emerald and I still haven't released
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to get them out in the next
couple of weeks, but there was a Runtz
[SPEAKER_01]: Chili, a Wedding Crashers Chili,
Wedding Cake Chili, Josh D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chili, Dosey Chili and Swedish Chili.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every one of them turned out just
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really happy with every single one
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I like about the Chili
Verde is that a lot of cookie hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: seemed to not like the sun and not like
food very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like that one, especially like you
put it out in the sun and it thrived.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fed it well and it thrived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it could eat, it could grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain aspects where like,
you know, I think sometimes like some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these, some of some cookie selections were
designed for like Rockwall and to be two
[SPEAKER_00]: feet tall in an indoor situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the Chili Verde can grow,
you know, like it can be a healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: happy, vigorous plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of cookie hybrids aren't that
way in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that one was one that was,
you know, you could put it in the sun and
[SPEAKER_00]: it would, you know, you could put it in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could depth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, it did well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a medium sized plant,
like something you want to get a half
[SPEAKER_00]: pound to a pound per plant off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gave you a lot of very,
very pretty weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you were saying the formation on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely attractive when it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a really nice aroma, you know,
and it gets me high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, I always thought because of the
lavender, it wasn't going to be a big
[SPEAKER_01]: yielder.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I was working for Ben up in
Mendo, we ran about 25 or 30 phenos of the
[SPEAKER_01]: F5s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, they were, we were pulling like
between three to seven pounds off some of
[SPEAKER_01]: them plants and they were just monsters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, arm sized colas from bottom to
top.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a little PM prone if you're in a
pretty nasty area, which can kind of be a
[SPEAKER_01]: bummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're in a dry, hot climate,
like here in the valley, they thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got really good root structure,
really good nutrient and water uptake to
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a good root.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a good root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little dangerous if you get some
fog for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's such thick buds, you know,
they're not like big buds, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: very dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's one of those things when
we're in dries, when you put it on there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're surprised at how much it weighs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it, but it, it, both of them,
they are a little, they are a little like
[SPEAKER_00]: a PM and, and, and gray mold sensitive,
but that's like any, I think all that
[SPEAKER_00]: lavender oracle, all those super dense
lines have that, you know, plants have
[SPEAKER_00]: pluses and minuses, but that was,
it was a good grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoyed growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're, if you're in a hot air
condition area, like especially like say
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in Arizona or Colorado,
they do, they do really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the valley, it can be like
110, 108 today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just like, you know,
bring it, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it's brutal right now,
dude in the valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like over 40, 45 days of over a hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we still got like probably another
10 days at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit starts making me question my
life choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really is when it hits,
I mean, it, it's, it's a little much like
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but it is interesting in the
sense that like, the, the hard part is you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get with like, you're right in dry
airy conditions, you can get some
[SPEAKER_00]: monsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just about like keeping them hydrated
and like, and making sure they don't go B
[SPEAKER_00]: grade because it's too hot at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, shade cloth is you got to
have some shade cloth on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't take 110 degree direct light
for hours on end.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just, they just don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way more light than they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you get like a good 30 to 40 or 50%
shade cloth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the thirties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep that over them the whole summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, they be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydration is the key, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So since you're growing in the valley and
you have a lot of experience with it,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, someone asked a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are some turps volatile to heat?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, are there some turps, like some
strains you cannot grow in the valley
[SPEAKER_02]: because it gets so hot?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so fucking hot during the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no point because it gets turpless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that possible?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The turps will, the turps will die.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get that kind of like not hay,
but it smells like old weed almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what also happened that I've seen is
I've actually seen trichrome heads melt
[SPEAKER_01]: out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The heads will just literally be like the
fucking stock of like, like a dead tree
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's like, you can see it where
it's oozed down and then you start getting
[SPEAKER_01]: like botrytis type situation where it
hurts the rock kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually think one of the, one of the
reasons why a bunch of Mendo and Southern
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt got so legendary for growing
outdoor is that even though it might be
[SPEAKER_00]: blazing hot in the daytime, that ocean
comes in and it cools it down at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that plant gets to cool down,
like it preserves turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if it's 105 in the day, but it gets
down to 55 degrees at night, that makes an
[SPEAKER_00]: enormous difference in the quality of your
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get too far inland,
like say grass valley, grass valley,
[SPEAKER_00]: you grow like some 10 or 15 pounders or
the desert, but that's what it's all about
[SPEAKER_00]: is trying to preserve your turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it's 108 in the daytime and 85
at night, you run big risk of not,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, not quite hay, but like not
any of what your plant could be potential
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely burn your turps off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and, and yeah, it makes it,
it makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: The key, the key to growing in the central
valley between like Bakersfield and
[SPEAKER_01]: Sacramento is realistically knowing your
times of when to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always tell people, if you're in Fresno,
I don't grow outdoor in between like July
[SPEAKER_01]: and the end of September.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, unless you're going to run a
cooled depth, it's not, it's not fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to run a water wall in like,
in like a greenhouse and add a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture and cool it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, well, it's, it's,
it's warm and it's dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, but you have the whole
rest of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get away with growing in the
valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can grow from September all
the way through until June, but you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really need to stop growing in the central
valley from that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But July, August, September, take that
time off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I even started taking summers off
indoors because it was just such a fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: battle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even trying to battle the air
conditioner with indoors and all,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was a fucking nightmare every year in
summer, no matter indoor or outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what people call it summer,
but yeah, you know, it's like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times people have a hard time growing the
best weed that they can in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They struggle with conditions.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if you've ever made seeds
in that kind of condition, but when you
[SPEAKER_01]: make seeds in over a hundred degree
weather, those motherfuckers are almost
[SPEAKER_01]: impossible to crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a lot of hand cracking with those
too, because they, they, they develop so
[SPEAKER_02]: thick in everything because they know that
it's hard and they want to keep their,
[SPEAKER_02]: their embryo alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, now that, now that we're like,
um, you know, things are getting,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you want to call it legal or more
acceptable or whatever it might be,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, we all used to grow weed where
we could get away with it for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not been a lot of thought of
like, which type of strains grow well
[SPEAKER_00]: where, you know, cause like in America,
it's like, we grow citrus in Florida,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or winter wheat in Montana or potatoes in
Idaho or corn in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you figure out where it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't really done that with weed
now, you know, but there's, so there's
[SPEAKER_00]: certain, I, I was even in Mendo,
there's so many micro climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have strains where like they did
amazing in one part of the County and I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: get a different spot and I'd put them out
and I'd be all in like stoked that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to crush it and they wouldn't do
that good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there was some other strains I
had that did really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's actually, there's some aspects
where I'm sure there's some strains that
[SPEAKER_00]: like acclimate just like growing in
British Columbia or Canada or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably some desert weed that's
like more acclimated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't really think of things that
way anymore, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, it's names and popularity and
maybe it's runs and maybe it's this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, um, I think sativa is
deal with the heat better than Indica's
[SPEAKER_00]: personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, and they have, they have better
water absorption abilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can hold water longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got thinner leaves, you know,
they're not, they don't have as much
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure like, and they, and they come
from places that are hot as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So one, one thing I noticed this year was,
um, people who are moving clones from one
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the state to the other are
experiencing like, it's almost like
[SPEAKER_01]: culture shock for the plants because
they're used to one environment and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you're moving them all the way to another
environment in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, but some are like,
yeah, they love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of falls into the same category
deal with the clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a serious, it's a serious thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't take into account,
but some strains definitely are more picky
[SPEAKER_02]: than others when acclimatizing even from
one grow room to the next in the same
[SPEAKER_02]: city.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, that difference can really flip
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would like to think that like you can
work with most nurseries and like get a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like tough and hardened off
plants that are going to be suited for
[SPEAKER_00]: your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of cases, you know, clone
companies or, you know, nurseries
[SPEAKER_00]: nowadays, they have these plants under 24
seven light, and they're just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them rooted and healthy until
somebody buys them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they get taken from like 24 seven
light under fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get boxed up in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he said, they get shipped down from
Northern California to your desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get opened up and then bam,
they're in the desert and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering and it's, and it's, and the
light drops by eight hours in one night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you used to be able to like,
if you grew in Mendo or Southern Humboldt
[SPEAKER_00]: or somewhere like that, like most people
would acclimate their clones and plants
[SPEAKER_00]: for their own season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays you buy, you know, people just
want to buy them from somewhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's like, I mean, when I was working
in Southern California, you would go,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the longest day of the year down
there is maybe 14 or 15 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting, you're going from 24
hours to 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 10 hour drop in one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have a plant trigger just from
the shock of the light cycle.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's kind of what happened to me
this year is I had some clone stock that I
[SPEAKER_01]: had in Southern Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spent two days, three days making the trip
down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got here, put them out here and
everything was like, Oh no, we don't like
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I kind of had a little bit of a
rough transition this last couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just kind of gave up and just the
bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just wait until I can get back into
another good position to be able to do
[SPEAKER_01]: some real work, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's also one of those things
too, where it's like a lot of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the stuff that's getting really
popular right now, um, Indica style is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably best for like being grown more
Northern climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, where you get way far South,
like where you guys are and you almost
[SPEAKER_00]: need some sativa mixed into your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want it to grow outdoor and
stretch, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's far enough South that it will
trigger fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of, that's kind of the,
one of the things that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people think that like,
Oh, you know, like figuring out what works
[SPEAKER_00]: well in your area is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to, I wanted to keep going over a
little bit more of the green craft stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know that's probably what people
want to hear the most about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's, it's a strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when we were working with it,
it was, it was all the clone was a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was nowhere all of a sudden
it's become a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's become a lost legend and just named
and all kinds of stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of imposters, lots of seed lines that
weren't real and right there with the
[SPEAKER_01]: lavender.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see the lavender around anymore
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that miracle lavender.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were all strains that, that,
so we had that, we had that push for
[SPEAKER_01]: strains that were like the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was like blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck the fucking lavender.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck the, you know, these, these strains
that just hit a wall all of a sudden and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wanted them, but nobody kept them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be some random dude around
that has a cut of it, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still healthy or not fucking knows,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of the biggest things is
trying to be a collector and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep genetics alive is that everybody will
help you back it up when it's flying out
[SPEAKER_00]: the door is flower and it's easy to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as the mood changes,
your, most of your best friends don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: want unless they can sell it to market and
it's working for them right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only want to keep clones of like
what's currently popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I mean, I mean everyone and I
mean, everyone that was growing a decent
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of weed in humble and Mendo in the
2004, 05, 06 era, they had one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel or one of those lavender,
one of those great vape or one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts, you know, and you know, green crack,
green cracks, a great plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow it small to medium sized,
it's got really nice turps, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got a nice buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It burns well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people got burnt out on it because
just like blue dreams, someone's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I can grow a 12 plow plant of this in
grass valley and it's going to be bee weed
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to ship it off and it's
going to be endless amounts of boofy green
[SPEAKER_00]: crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: The green crack too was like half the
plant was LARF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and then that part that was
tremble was usually the tremors fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: hated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, fuck this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, it kind of just went by the
wayside pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's funny about that one is that
you think about like the eras.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if that had had like its moment in
the sun now when everyone's extracting and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that LARFy stuff probably would dump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was a great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from my experience, it was a great,
like you could blow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would blow great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you tried to wash it, it was,
it was almost too greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, it was just kind of fell into
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Category of it was just too hard to work
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's kind of why, that's kind
of why I got away from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I've been trying to figure out what
green crack is for a long time,
[SPEAKER_02]: years and years and years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over the years, as my experience gets
better with different strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, my opinion kind of changes on
what I think it might be early on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, this has got to be some kind
of so mango because it's so purple and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's super mango.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, okay, the mango purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I went on, okay, maybe I see some
scum going in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, with the mango over time and,
and, and the more I look at it and the
[SPEAKER_02]: more I figure it out, the more I realize
that might even be a Mendo perp something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where the story kind of gets
convoluted because a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: associate purple with green crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I was running, what I, what I was
calling the candy crack does not get
[SPEAKER_01]: purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it down to 20 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not get purple at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's more watermelon than mango.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that, that lends more towards a
skunk one side than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a skunk, I mean, you can look at
it and just the way that it forms it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's spear buds all over itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely see some skunk
influence in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that if it is a skunk one
phenol, it's definitely my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: tasting phenol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it has a night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has no, when it's done right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nice turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The original seeds I used to make the,
uh, the green craft stuff that like,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, what were they called that company
that made green crack S ones, but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: Spanish company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sick mitts, sick mitts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used, they used our S ones to make
the S twos and sold them as S ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, um, it was heavy purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and it wasn't always purple,
but it was like the, like three,
[SPEAKER_02]: three degrees of cold change.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would just flip black almost like Mendo
purpose does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah, it was super, super
overwrite mangoes, purple, not,
[SPEAKER_02]: not frosty like a cookies cut,
but it was good resin for its time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was attractive.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really fiery orange hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see people mentioning Cecil,
like me and Cecil, when we first met each
[SPEAKER_02]: other, we tried to figure out if he had
anything to do with it and what we
[SPEAKER_02]: determined he had nothing to do with San
Diego West coast green crap, nothing at
[SPEAKER_02]: all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just that when we received the cut,
uh, it was, it was CUSH and he sent a cut
[SPEAKER_02]: West.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was also spelled wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: CUSH.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just a better keeper than cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather have real green crack than
cheese, but that's like a personal
[SPEAKER_00]: preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A personal preference for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personal preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my personal preference was I would
rather smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, what's interesting is that
we were talking about how you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, unreliable, uh, phylos was earlier,
which is a bummer because all of us have
[SPEAKER_00]: these like great desires to know how
things are related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember Caleb telling me that like,
uh, when, uh, DNA submitted their Las
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegas lemon skunk that it came in exactly
the same cut as green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't surprise me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys are the worst for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like DNAs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they're cantaloupes was just the
C 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but I just mean in the sense that
it was a, it was a good enough cut that
[SPEAKER_00]: they used it in all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just got rid of like the name
connotation, you know, like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: we won't call it green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be Las Vegas lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is kind of lemon skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I was kind of leaning like when
they start talking about the green ribbon,
[SPEAKER_01]: what I know is my candy is more leans
towards that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe then the green crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always kind of was wondering if the
green crack was just an offshoot from
[SPEAKER_01]: that, or maybe I had an offshoot of the
original green crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it got convoluted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's people will start hating me up
and turns into an argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just started being like,
fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's mind just got blown in the
comments and they just realized that
[SPEAKER_00]: cantaloupe Hayes was C 99.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the story was so much, and this,
this came from, uh, I won't say what came
[SPEAKER_02]: from it, but it came from the Amsterdam
dudes that were friends with all these
[SPEAKER_02]: guys and a part of the same group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Soma gave them a pack of C 99 to start
their company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough that C 99 became the eight
week Hayes magical eight week 95% sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: and comes in eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just thought that comment just that
just, that just, well, because they were,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were some of the first people that
they went around California and they took
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of famous cuts and they gave them
different names and they started a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company with it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't like brothers, Graham tried to take
the credit for the C 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't he like the guy or something like
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, his partner was his partner was,
and now he's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we're left with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: If after meeting him and then you learn he
had a partner that everything it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, that makes sense then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, green crack,
it's got to, in my opinion, got a bad
[SPEAKER_00]: reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most of the time you could,
you could grow an eight or 10 pound plant
[SPEAKER_00]: of green crack and it would kind of suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you grew like a four or five pound
plant of green crack, it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you grew a one or two pound plant
of it, it was killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most people just tried to blow it up
into these, like, I'm going to grow 99
[SPEAKER_00]: green cracks and get just boo coo weed and
I'm not going to dry it that nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people are like, Oh, I don't like
green crack.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what happens to a lot of big
yielding cuts like blue dream,
[SPEAKER_00]: green crack, uh, you know, Barry white,
these various ones that run through,
[SPEAKER_00]: they get blown out by people that don't
care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chili birdies got kind of a bad rap
through the distros in California because
[SPEAKER_01]: of the dark heart cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dark heart fucking jumped on a cut of
chili birdie.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got, um, from a friend of mine named
moon gazer, moon gazer kind of dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a quick little phenol hunt,
dropped a chili cut on them real fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't the greatest chili and it
wasn't producing the best flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these growers have jumped on it
right away, took all this flower to the
[SPEAKER_01]: distros and the distros were like,
Oh, we can't fucking do anything with
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of like, it's like,
it depends on who you talk to and like who
[SPEAKER_01]: really liked the chili and because of what
cut they had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the purple city cut, or if they were
running a cut for me, um, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: they distros take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're running like a dark heart
cut, they might not take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's nice about that is that,
you know, it seems like in chili Verde,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's a number of people that found
a number of cuts that had like a range of
[SPEAKER_00]: turps and effects that they liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's, that's because of the fact
that I dumped all the seeds on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't leave it to be just a single
clone only cut being just one or two cuts
[SPEAKER_01]: out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made sure that I got enough seeds out to
the farmers, that there was some diversity
[SPEAKER_01]: that people could start actually pheno
hunting out some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there are, there's a lot of good
phenos in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a few duds here and
there, but there's fucking some wiring,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially as you start working the line,
depending on which way you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I started going with this,
like a pine, there's a pineapple pheno in
[SPEAKER_01]: there that I've been working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chirping profile was super high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's, the great pheno that
kind of everybody knows that great pheno
[SPEAKER_01]: is really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's kind of more of an
unknown cheese pheno that floats in there
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that cheese pheno is bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave, um, the humble local Joey,
I gave him some of the key points and he
[SPEAKER_01]: was like, it turned out fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheese, chili Verde, sweet lavender
cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the cheese comes out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really sure, but so in like the
key lime pie, the key lime pie,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was told originally it was Durban
poison, OG Kush, cherry pie, but I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that does that sound like that still
hold truth to it or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the key lime pie is also like,
it was also going around is the green
[SPEAKER_02]: sherb, the original sherb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, also stardust sherb for a while as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, if I remember correctly,
it's the mom of what became Skittles is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is, is what people mostly tend to think
that have been growing a bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can find like the Skittles type
phenos in the out process and in the S
[SPEAKER_02]: ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, as far as what it actually
is, it's kind of like trying to peg down
[SPEAKER_02]: what cherry pie actually is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, wow, they said a thousand
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think it's likely that all
those things you mentioned are in there in
[SPEAKER_00]: some form or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, that's like the cheese is
the only one that kind of throws me off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there is a very distinctive cheese,
you know, that I did find in the F ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and yeah, I was like, I didn't know if
it came out of the Durban side or maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: the OG side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't really like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Durban that those dudes used was,
it was so different from like the NorCal
[SPEAKER_02]: derb or the Colorado derb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was nothing like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was, it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not turpentine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't the turpentine stuff at all.
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, we're just in the
infancy of figuring out how these
[SPEAKER_00]: different things, flavor combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I, you know, maybe it,
maybe it, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also think too, like when
people smell, it's like they related to
[SPEAKER_00]: things in their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like someone might get strong cheese and
somebody else might like get a totally
[SPEAKER_00]: different impression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like almost like when you go to shows and
you're showing people jars and you'll show
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe like a hundred people the jar and
you'll hear like 20 different comments of
[SPEAKER_01]: what they smell and they're all different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually really liked that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do that with my trimmers where I
would ask them away from the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmers, what they were smelling with
what they were working on because I liked
[SPEAKER_00]: unvarnished like opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I heard the same thing four or
five times, I'd start to accept that
[SPEAKER_00]: people got that turp or that aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't call it turps then or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to know what they related it
to, you know, because, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: language of it is so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if somebody said, you know,
and a lot of strains, I grew over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would ask different trimmers over
the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what do you think the Maui smells
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think this, this smells like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes their answers would be
pretty surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you, you wouldn't have seen
that before they said it, but then when
[SPEAKER_00]: they say it, it clicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do, I do think asking people's
opinions, like a show would be a really
[SPEAKER_00]: cool place to get a bunch of quick back,
you know, like feedback on what something
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody was telling me recently that a
Zomedical Farmer, he's got a chili that's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I think he said it was papaya or
guava.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget exactly what it was, but yeah,
I was like, I've never, I've never smelled
[SPEAKER_01]: that in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we were going through some jars
recently and somebody was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I smell it totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I get it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think Flann nailed it on the
head.
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be some skunk one and cherry
pie and key lime pie and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like it's just the whole gamut
of skunk one smells the grape,
[SPEAKER_02]: the fucking cheese, the all that is in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, there's an aspect to
where, you know, it is possible that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a lot of Durban, you know,
had skunk one in it because it came
[SPEAKER_00]: through Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and a lot of Durban came through
Dutch Passion later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sold the Durban poison and that had
more skunk one in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely, it's definitely
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking that, that the, the F1 Durban
is probably a hybrid of the Dutch Passion
[SPEAKER_02]: one, because it looks like some of the old
pictures of the old one, but just,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just grown much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now today times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Durban's one of those strains that
like is so old that most people don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with what Durban was like in
the eighties and nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then what survived too,
you know, and then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, but then that Colorado cut and
some of those other ones that got famous
[SPEAKER_00]: later were super turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and once you've got turpentine
in a line, it hangs out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to shake it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to shake it out, but I do like,
you know, we, I worked with a Durban in
[SPEAKER_00]: the early two thousands and it was
definitely more on that anise black
[SPEAKER_00]: licorice type of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't really get like this,
the type of turpentine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say it was more like your black
anise?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you just said?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, so that, you know,
indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are you working on now,
Eric?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's cracking now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the last few years, I've been
pushing a couple, a couple of lines,
[SPEAKER_01]: my Durban or excuse me, Durban,
my diamond master, uh, got an orange
[SPEAKER_01]: creamsicle, um, Hell's angel cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have some peanut butter stuff,
but right now, currently what I'm working
[SPEAKER_01]: on is actually some FEMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've never really released FEMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did one little FEM run a couple of
years, got six years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was, um, a blue dream, a blue dream
to blueberry hash plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm working on now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is, um, doing kind of a hypey run just for
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, everybody's been just inundating me
for FEMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I did a collaboration with a buddy
of mine, uh, Wyatt Terp 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a chili berry skittles cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I feminized that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I hit that to like 10 or 15 hypey
strains, like Yule fuel, sunset cider,
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apple tarts, uh, orange diesel,
um, Bubba Kush,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, dirty skittles, SFV and LA Kush cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping like the normal market that
comes to me may not be interested in that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the market that I haven't been tapping
into because I only sell regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping they'll be like, yeah,
we're, we're on, you know, I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: trying, I've been trying to explain this
to people that, um, what's going on with
[SPEAKER_02]: our market and that, and, and a lot of
people shit on when I say it, but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if to have a viable seed company,
you have to tap into that market or it
[SPEAKER_02]: just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not enough people to support,
uh, the niche market of rare strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: old strains, unique strength.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not there anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody gives a fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird that in the last, you know,
I mean, we went from, from four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: people doing feminized stuff 12 or 14
years ago to 99% of the market or more
[SPEAKER_00]: being feminized stuff and reg seeds,
which was the standard for forever are now
[SPEAKER_00]: like a tiny little corner.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's a Gittles and crybabies,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This Gittles Rarity Crosses will take off.
[SPEAKER_02]: People give a chance, especially because
it's almost like a, a, a back cross,
[SPEAKER_02]: in a sense, a back cross to the key line
pie by the skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd probably be a turf explosion and it
would probably grow better and look better
[SPEAKER_00]: than skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, you know, no, no skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got chilly structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it holds itself up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't want to fall over and fucking
be like, yeah, you can smell, you can
[SPEAKER_01]: smell the skittles in there, but the
chilies there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, and it's, um, I don't know if
you've run the dirty skills or if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with that, it's a new one from,
I think Micah up at, um, Houston meds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got that farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think he has that limo G or whatever
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really similar to that, but yeah,
I'm, I really dug it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy, uh, Wyatt Terps made it and I
was kind of had three Finos to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: slept through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, wow, these are fucking
bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were talking like, you were talking
like Lempire farms, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's who did the dirty skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lempire farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micah has a, he has a dispensary in my
town in Ukiah and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's, you know, he's got a bunch of
seeds that he's been making, but that
[SPEAKER_02]: someone wants you to mention, um,
electric Boogaloo dog shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you doing any work at that?
[SPEAKER_01]: The dog shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I have some of the last dog shit
speeds that were given out, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, core genetics gave me some dog shit,
but I have, I can't forget them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just kind of sitting on them at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that sounds cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that who supposedly bred it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no, a guy out of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, a gentleman out of Oregon bred it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember the name of the person
who, who bred the dog shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at an event, um, we did a sesh up in
Southern Humboldt a few months back,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Joey from Humboldt local.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ran into to Eric from Forever
Flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, like that Eric.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Eric from core genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, Hey, take these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the last dog shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like these are the last formal breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to get into them,
but I just, I'm not in a spot right now
[SPEAKER_01]: where I can do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, yeah, I'm sure that gives
not so a major boner.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a, he's a electric Boogaloo dog shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got, it's got nice flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty, it's got an up high,
you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: High Lonesome loves that one too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what his face too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it's a, it's a nice sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, and I think a lot of people
are in that same boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of breeders right now that
are looking around at like, what should I,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, what, what would I like to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're trying to figure out,
well, what should I do to make it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, and it's, it's kind of a
hard thing to navigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you were talking about growing hypey
things and trying to figure out where you
[SPEAKER_00]: fit in and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, there's a lot of
breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of seed makers in the game
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even put myself in the breeding
category anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember the last time I worked,
like worked a line several generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's hard to, it's hard to do
that nowadays and know that it's probably
[SPEAKER_02]: not going to sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's two distinct markets that
have broken out that you kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, like if you're making
seeds, you have to be making washers,
[SPEAKER_01]: something that washes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hash guys are going to want the
extract thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it's all seem to be going to,
or your hypey market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the hypey market, once the hypey
guys get a hold of that shit, they're the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that find that cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that cut gets taken over to the
commercial growers and then the commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: growers blow it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're not tapping into those
two, you're, you're kind of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, what am I, like, what the fuck am I
going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, cause I was stuck in the middle
for the longest time where I had dedicated
[SPEAKER_01]: lines of regulars that I was making.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have certain growers that like to run
those lines and they're willing to go
[SPEAKER_01]: through my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the hype market, which is the general
consumer who grows six or 10 plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: who doesn't want anything to do with mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want anything to do with penal
hunting stuff that they don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if they recognize it and they can
pop it and we can grow it real quick and
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke it and they like it, that seems to
be where it's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So washers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people, people only see what we
present like out front.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always talk about this, like a lot
of it is smoking mirrors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's a few of us who don't care to
front like we're richer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're famous, you know, that are just
farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of people, it's all smoking
mirrors and they present like they're
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking flexing, fucking blinging chains
and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're wearing a gold chain and like
going to all these events everywhere,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're probably not doing much growing
because most of us are tired of the
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking row.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking mirrors is a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And behind the scenes ever since COVID
there are, there are seed makers and
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders alike.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they'll message me and tell me
that this is, they're scared.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're scared for their future and they
don't know who to talk to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have any answers because I fuck
I'm, I'm the same spot as all them,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people get the market that they pay
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually the people that have that
small niche market of the 2% that wants
[SPEAKER_02]: something unique that like running seeds
to find their own unique thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not enough to hold over the whole
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So eventually some, something's going to
have to change or, or we have to change
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reflect the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm struggling like really bad right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm kind of worried with like,
if I'll have enough money for my bills
[SPEAKER_01]: next month kind of thing, you know,
there's, there's a lot going on in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of potential in the world
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on with all these countries
coming online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just like, man, I hope I can just
get by long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: To where I can get to a spot where I can
be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I don't even know if I'll ever
make it for that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely a lot of soul searching
going on in the weed community right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, about what, what works and you
know, I think there's that natural human
[SPEAKER_00]: instinct to like get good at a certain
niche or a certain aspect of something and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just want that to continue,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it works for you and you're good
at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then life throws you curve balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, one of the cool things about
like the two 15 era was how diverse it
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many different people could be
involved on different levels and make a
[SPEAKER_00]: living.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's getting consolidated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, the amount of people that
used to make a living off it are probably
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to make a living off it that
that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you fit in?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you work?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you survive?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you make it happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that's the thing is I'm
noticing that I don't fit into the new
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've tried to get jobs numerous times
at these new facilities or these new
[SPEAKER_01]: operations that are licensed and I'm
either not getting hired or I'm getting
[SPEAKER_01]: ghosted once I get there or I show up and
it's so fucked up, I leave.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, I, I'm to the point now where
I'm like, yeah, I'm going to go take a job
[SPEAKER_01]: doing delivery or doing something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just grow my hobby weed on my own and
just be like, fuck the weed world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm still like, still trying to hold
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, I've retired from the fact
that I will not be a licensed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Walton's cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what that video a few months back
was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm retiring and getting the fuck out of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm done with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of misled people in the fact
that I was getting out of the weed world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm retiring from trying to be a company
like a licensed company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It, it, it sounded great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like early on, you know, like,
oh, the weed people can finally,
[SPEAKER_02]: the ones who have been, once we've been
fighting for this to make it legal,
[SPEAKER_02]: fighting for legalization, finally get to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We finally get to grow safely,
not get guns put to our head, not end up
[SPEAKER_02]: in prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that was all just yanked out from
under us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a, there's a, there's an
aspect too with that, where you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe some of the pricing was risk
factor and a, and a willingness to take
[SPEAKER_00]: risks and a willingness to have some balls
to do some of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and so as the risk goes
out, so does some of the probability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the margins get tighter on
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the other part of it is,
you know, when we were talking about hype
[SPEAKER_00]: things is part of it for older growers is
that all of the skillsets that kept us
[SPEAKER_00]: alive and safe for a long time or starting
to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to be invisible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to be low key.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when you, when we were talking
earlier on the beginning of the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's, he basically, you crawled
out from under your rock in like 2014,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2015, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that long, you know, like,
so you were growing a long time and hiding
[SPEAKER_00]: and staying quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the people that are doing,
you know, somewhat better are really loud
[SPEAKER_00]: and really out there and really promoting
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not the skillset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us had, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Self promotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we wanted the work to speak for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people were like, well,
fuck the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just say I have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll get people believing it's,
I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see my gold chain, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You see my gold chain shows I did the
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, honestly, that type of
thing where you let you go to like a
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies opening or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's various people standing there
and like, they, you know, they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: think like they want their breeder hero to
be a boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an aspect of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People do that because they're making
money off the image of being a baller
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the car salesman mentality is most
people want to be sold on something and be
[SPEAKER_01]: convinced that it's going to change their
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way they can go then do the
Kardashian thing and show it the fuck off
[SPEAKER_01]: and be like, look what I fucking got.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, you know, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you guys a good story that I
heard the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of our close friends, his property
almost burned down up in Humboldt area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he, he's, he's a, he's, he's more
rotunda like me shorter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that motherfucker was swimming across
lakes to water his plants, rivers,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a mad man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and, and this is probably one of the
most successful people in our,
[SPEAKER_02]: in our industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he didn't think twice about going and
jumping in a fucking river to go water his
[SPEAKER_02]: plants daily just because it was all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, sectioned off.
[SPEAKER_02]: He couldn't drive up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's, and like I heard you say too,
like, yeah, if it's all done, then I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: just grow my hobby girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we don't stop, but the, the people
who love weed, it's not going to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is, is on that level,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that the part that annoys the fuck
out of me is like the, the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've, you know, it almost makes me like
talk about like, maybe I'll get on my soap
[SPEAKER_00]: box here for a second and get pissed off,
but there's an aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it's to me, it's not really been
made legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been made like taxed and regulated,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like, if it was fully legal,
then, you know, theoretically speaking,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say like all the money went out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: For whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all three of us on this podcast that I
had to go out and get different jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I could grow half my backyard with
a bunch of different things from my seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and make seeds and trade amongst other
friends and enthusiasts and share cuttings
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that, not commercially,
but just because we cared, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're talking about like the heirloom
vegetable market before it got popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it was just a bunch of enthusiasts
with going to like weird shows that nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: went to about wheat, about, about tomatoes
or about zucchinis or about squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's all the rage heirlooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, think about how many
decades those people kept all of those old
[SPEAKER_00]: heirloom, you know, varieties before the
popularity came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the way I look at it is like
six plants is an insult because that means
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can't breed at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a license to breed weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're going to be a hobby
breeder, you can probably get away with
[SPEAKER_00]: it, realistically speaking, but like it's
not legal where you can just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, control the sale of it if you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But think about how much cool shit you
could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of, there's a lot of weed
people that just love weed and they would
[SPEAKER_00]: grow weed, even if it didn't have a
financial benefit, like a summer garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for, for real, but you can't
because you can only have six fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want you to go to a dispensary and
buy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, any breeder knows you can't
crack six seeds and get anywhere on any
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of project you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not if you really care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not if you want to make progress.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not if you really care and want to make
progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really like I've gotten to the
point where I don't even really like
[SPEAKER_00]: discussing it as legal weed because I
look, there's no, I'm, I can go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: liquor store and how much money I have in
my pocket, I can buy as much liquor as I
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can buy booze, beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can buy Dom Perignon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can buy kegs and kegs, kegs and kegs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can fill a whole garage in my house with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give it out to friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can share.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can throw a party in my backyard and
have a hundred people over and give it
[SPEAKER_00]: away for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like when weed gets treated like
alcohol or vegetables, I'll start thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: of it as legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like what Ring said right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said the lack of cash has only
reinforced how much everyone who is
[SPEAKER_02]: getting out of it was into it to begin
with.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, him and I have been joking about it
actually, cause we don't, we don't live
[SPEAKER_00]: very far from each other at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we both moved to Mendo when it was
kind of like depressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you saw this enormous green rush
rush in for the money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now is the money's been really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last two or three years, you see like
the reverse green rush where most of them
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't want to live there unless they
could make a bunch of easy money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so Southern Humble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Southern Humble is making such bad shape,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for the first time ever, like I think
the triangle might get, has been cut off
[SPEAKER_00]: to the point where it could actually
suffocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming to ghost town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trinity, Southern Humble, Mendo,
the way that everything got built up,
[SPEAKER_00]: the structure of how people cut deals with
each other and grew weed and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: various aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an enormous danger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody see the dark horse breeding
facility?
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck are they going to do with
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: He buys all his seeds from breeders.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people might, people might not
want to know this or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this might be embarrassing them or
whatnot, but I'll say it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Heart is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but there was a number of early
nurseries that became nurseries because
[SPEAKER_00]: they were so bad at growing flour that
their flour, even in the 215 era was hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to move through anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're, when you're growing a
bunch of warehouses in the Bay of B and C
[SPEAKER_00]: grade indoor, like a few of these
companies flipped into clones because that
[SPEAKER_00]: was just easier, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they couldn't grow good bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they take bad health practices
and they spread viruses and diseases all
[SPEAKER_00]: over California before anybody had an idea
of what was going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of which, speaking of which,
let me plug this in real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: On September 9th, we are going to be
having the people, I'm not going to say
[SPEAKER_02]: their name because people just snipe
everyone on shows, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the, the, the foremost experts on the
hops late and fibroid doing studies out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the room and they're fucking killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to have them on to cover
and try to figure out all this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to, it's going to be a
really cool show because there's a lot of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of maybe we'll call it, we've called it
bro science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of ineffective sterilization
ideas out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of ways that people
don't understand how it moves around and
[SPEAKER_00]: how clean practices work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, when we all got started in
the nineties, you could have one razor
[SPEAKER_00]: blade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like the most unprotected,
like carefree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically use the razor blade until it
got dull.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's almost like you want to be
like a tattoo artist where you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: clean, clean tools for every single,
every single tattoo you're giving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every single plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really don't want to spread things,
you have to kind of take that sort of like
[SPEAKER_00]: that new approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're still learning a bunch of,
about it, honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to put that in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it'll be an excellent episode
and we'll try to uncover some of the myths
[SPEAKER_02]: going around, like it being transmissible
and seed, if that's a fact, if it's not,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working with a, um, a plant
scientist from Brazil on a nursery in
[SPEAKER_01]: Redwood Valley last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was working on hops by Roy and
other plants for quite a few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prior to getting into cannabis and she was
saying that it was a 20% transmissible
[SPEAKER_01]: through breeding indices in other
varieties of plant species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she was assuming that it would also
transfer over into cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: From what they've seen, there's been zero
transmission in cannabis as far as,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the, the cannabis species.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, and, and with hemp, it was 8%
transmissibility or six or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was something very low, but in
cannabis, for some reason it's not,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not seeing any.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can hope that it's going to stay
that way, or maybe it's just undetectable
[SPEAKER_02]: with what our tools are currently,
but I guess we're going to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a viroid is even tinier than a
virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes it so hard to kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even like a living thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a cult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a collection of, it's like a
little piece of data floating around
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting to attach to the right thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A district, I just watched it this morning
and they're the experts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said 8%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So suck my dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I hear correctly that, um,
dark heart, dark heart nurse or dark
[SPEAKER_01]: horse?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not so trans drive dark horse for dark
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I was slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what happened, but that's
where I'm getting, getting the fashion of
[SPEAKER_02]: scientists district.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard they're going out of business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I did hear that, but I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I did hear that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know if that was a rumor or if
that was for real or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said they came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said they came up with a cure or a
treatment program.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then other, you know, other
opposing nurseries bought plants from them
[SPEAKER_00]: and still had, and still had the viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, they supplied the viroid and
passed the viroid massively.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had to come up with the solution
so they can make money off it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it got fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then they were promoting that new,
um, non-breedable clone stock there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like, like corn where all the corn
farmers, you can't breed that corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to buy a seed every year
because it's not breedable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I heard that's what dark heart was
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just announced that like a month ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a, there's an aspect right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is probably going to be
like a big deal in the next 10 to 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: where like, if you're going to have this
industry that's going to be worth billions
[SPEAKER_00]: and billions of dollars nationwide,
they just can't accept that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all of these strains right now are
basically open source.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to want to lock that shit
in and they're going to want to control
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you guys know everybody,
every breeder knows, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make chili Verde or NL five haze
or punchy blue, whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: any, any strain name, as soon as you sell
it, it's out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't control it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can buy it from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can make their own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can sell their own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people could, he, you know,
uh, he could make a deal with a nursery to
[SPEAKER_00]: like have verified chili Verde and another
nursery could buy a hundred of clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow up all those moms and start selling
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has nothing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you release things into the,
into the world, they're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people don't like, you know,
corporations and big companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like, like, uh, you know,
uh, they've intellectual property,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really weird because,
you know, I, you know, there's an argument
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's like, there's companies going
around right now, trying to make like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, marketing deals with various
collectors and breeders to get old stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that person would get kickbacks,
but who should get a kickback for it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen anybody really be paid a
kickback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people are kicking around ideas,
but all that is all that's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that's going to try to be more
standardized.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, I was offered
royalties on chili Verde through like dark
[SPEAKER_01]: heart, a few other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but it was on the stipulation that I
had a state license and that I was then
[SPEAKER_01]: going to sell them the one clone first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from then they could give me
royalties back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but you better be licensed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You better be licensed, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say they make a deal with you and
every clone that they sell of that thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: they give you a percentage, but I buy 500
clones from them and I take it to my
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery and I don't have any deal with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I start selling thousands of clones of
chili Verde a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of that residual goes to him
because I don't have a deal with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just bought this thing from a nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't owe anybody anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can suck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been a problem the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually is like back in the day,
it's, it's to some degree why,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the reasons why a lot of breeders
started not wanting to tell you what's in
[SPEAKER_00]: their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they didn't want people to know that
it's like they wanted it to be secret
[SPEAKER_00]: sauce because they didn't have any control
over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you release it, it's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in the last few seed sessions
that we've had seed swaps up in Southern
[SPEAKER_01]: humble I've seen an influx of people
coming in that are from out of the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they literally go and buy seed from
every single person at the whole entire
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they buy everything of what that
person has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they walk out with a whole box
full of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, that's not what you normally
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we've been running those swaps up
there for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an anomaly, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three or four years we were doing these
swaps and then it was always locals come
[SPEAKER_01]: in, doing a little bit of trading,
maybe buying a few seeds here and there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this last, this last six months
or so, I was just watching these people
[SPEAKER_01]: come in and I'm like, they're,
they're collecting for somebody big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what the fuck, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these big farms out there that are
just getting geared up to go to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, go public.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's that, it's that thing where it's
like it, we've got decades of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it all stays open source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it's pretty punk rock in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I'm not saying that like in
the future, they might not walk things in
[SPEAKER_00]: where they can put like genetic markers
into certain breeding lines where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell it's from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I basically think that like everything
from the beginning of cannabis to 2018 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 19 should be, it's, it's just out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, you know, and it might be shitty
for some people, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise everyone's going to lock it in
and control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people are, that's what will
happen is people will get sued like
[SPEAKER_00]: Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now the U S is like going to be
like, we're way behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like, if you look at like Columbia
right now, Columbia is already on the move
[SPEAKER_01]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're already looking at licensing and
holding onto these genetics and calling
[SPEAKER_01]: them there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're being set up for worldwide
distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the U S is lagging and in what
regard of being on top of licensing needs
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are, we will stay open source here
for a long time because of the lack of the
[SPEAKER_01]: government wanting to really open up ganja
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the entire market in Columbia is
just kind of kicking around, getting
[SPEAKER_00]: started, hoping that America opens up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think that a lot of these
people that are going to third world
[SPEAKER_00]: countries right now in these other places,
trying to set up shop are trying to have
[SPEAKER_00]: their roots in if it goes federal,
so they can, they can export from this
[SPEAKER_00]: place that doesn't have OSHA and doesn't
have this and doesn't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really what it is,
is that they're not down there to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a bunch of money in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's cool if it happens,
but they're hoping that our market opens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Thailand's kind of interesting
right now to see what's going on there
[SPEAKER_01]: because they've just opened up hemp and
they're letting everybody sell it just
[SPEAKER_01]: open anywhere and there's no age limit on
it, but everybody's already growing ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using like kind of how we did with
the CBD thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're selling weed as hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, but it's supposed to be for export
only.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really not supposed to be consuming
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, kind of curious to see how that's
going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm already seeing, I've already seen
two or three US companies, seed companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that are already there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, how, how does, how did that
work out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how did you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, get, get us there, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get us there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if I can make some money over
the next two months or so, I want to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a while, my wife or my fiance is there
waiting for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that could be something big for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone watching, let's support our
homeboy and get them to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what's up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is one of the dudes who will
actually go chase down land races and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's beneficial to all of us to get in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at getting over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a fiance that's from Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of years ago, she lost her visa,
mostly because of what I do and who I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they sent her back and I haven't
seen her in almost three years,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And getting my passport was a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some problems when I was younger
living on the border.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first time I applied for my
passport, they denied me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they gave me COVID bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it took me almost two years to get
my passport.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I finally got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, now I just have to make a little
bit of money if I can afford to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, finances.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving in state, moving in cities,
expensive as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even imagine moving out of the
country, how expensive that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if I can actually move full
time because I have to go over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get married.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I can apply for a marriage visa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll open it up for trying to get dual
citizenship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can move there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wouldn't be able to stay there full
time unless the Thai government approved
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I heard that's kind of really
difficult.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I watched 90 Day Fiance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, that shit's crazy with the passports
and the immigration and all that stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: between countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's insane, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everybody keeps telling me I
need to watch that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm like, I'm living it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it on that show is sex tourism.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just like the craziest
motherfuckers doing the craziest shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But every once in a while, there's good
people on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's crazy what they put them through.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my fiance, she's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to getting over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a good woman.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: She sounds like you, especially if you
took such a big hit for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's a partner, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a partner.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made the mistake of I sent her some
pictures on her phone of the farm when she
[SPEAKER_01]: was going to come stay with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when she got the customs, they went
through her phone and found the pictures
[SPEAKER_01]: and were like, oh, yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that small, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had trimmers that would fly in that
worked long time that worked for me for
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes when the smartphone era
happened, they can absolutely look through
[SPEAKER_00]: everything they want and see if they want
to let you in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so used to fly men in from Amsterdam
constantly.
Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, they will look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's it's you know, American is
sort of like the gold standard passport to
[SPEAKER_00]: travel around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not the easiest, most welcoming
place to get into for lots of countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially in the last two, three years,
it's gotten to where they don't they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to let anybody in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So free to free movement of people hasn't
been the easiest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But was there anything else you want to
want to cover tonight?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is there any projects we haven't
talked about that you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing some collaborations with
Ryan over at Wallflower Nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ryan's been helping me out tremendously
and Eva are amazing people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of basically holding my my
stock, my genetics for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they got all our shit, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do love them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan is a good person.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they they're they're good people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is Radio Ridge that I refer to
often.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wallflower Radio Ridge, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wallflower Radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wallflower is Radio Ridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I've been working with Ryan.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's helping me on this collaboration with
these fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, it's been really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, just the last few months
have been really difficult financially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try not to get down too much,
but I'm one of those depressed kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: people already.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, dude, this far into the week
game.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not jaded, then you're not
realistic with yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a positive failure no matter
what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, if I was if I was more
into being self promoting and being one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these guys who is on the Internet,
like just blowing myself up and constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: being there, I'd be way better off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm one of those guys that like I
haven't met online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when people come at me, I'm like,
it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is buy it or don't buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a fuck.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not the greatest sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I have that issue, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like trying to trying to like push
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel like you use to ourselves and
like these seeds are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like a fucking slime ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the fucking point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's hard, man.
It's hard.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but yeah, that's that's pretty much
what's going on with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just focused on trying to to get to
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, I don't I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you after that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of up in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So someone real quick, someone asked if
your cream is good for eczema.
[SPEAKER_02]: His son has eczema.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very good for eczema, depending on
the condition of eczema.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can take anywhere from a couple of
weeks to a couple of months to see
[SPEAKER_01]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I've had very good success with
eczema.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully that helps us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the cocoa cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not not the tiger, not the not the
cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do you want to do your end of
the night spiel, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can find all that at HPK top goals
dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a good place for people to find
your seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a couple couple seed banks that
sell my stuff or you can go through me
[SPEAKER_01]: directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to go through a bank,
there's immaculate seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's penal paradise.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's daggers, dagga love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Neptune, some of Neptune's sub
banks carry my stuff, but I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly which ones.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, or just contact me directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from time to time, I'll throw some
stuff up on my website as well.

stuff if you buy from Breeders Direct.
