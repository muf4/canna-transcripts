[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is one of the hardest parts of
seed cracking when you have an old seed
[SPEAKER_00]: that is really expensive and really rare
and you want to Give it the best shot at
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend this unless you're
really good at Hand control and you've had
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of practice as you can see the seed
is sitting here in between the scissors
[SPEAKER_00]: normally this would not be ideal,
but I Know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just slightly crack the shell
Without damaging the embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea here is to get water into the
seed shell That's how seedling embryos
[SPEAKER_00]: form when you put them into germinate is
when the water enters the shell it begins
[SPEAKER_00]: the process however, some seed shells are
just too thick for Water to get in and it
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people think this is like a dud
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not necessarily the case It may
just have a thick shell in the case of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when You need to do so you just
gently take it you hold it with your hand
[SPEAKER_00]: you put it at the very top Top top part as
far as it'll sit in there of the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's where you have the best
control over the scissors and gently
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear a Sound and that means the
seed has been cracked now this there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing coming out of the seed I don't
know if I can get this thing if I could
[SPEAKER_00]: zoom in but whatever There's nothing
nothing coming out of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see any juice or any shit coming
out of the seed or Anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the lightest crap of the shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're trying to get to here
and from there You just put it back into
[SPEAKER_00]: your wet paper towel treated with three
drops of hydrogen peroxide per every 2,000
[SPEAKER_00]: ml of water Put that bitch right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh My god, there we go right there right
there and she's ready to go label her up
[SPEAKER_00]: and Put her back In this case,
this really isn't an expensive seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is a seed with the hard shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a Canocopia's BC Roadkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see how How roadkilling this
deep chunk cross is gonna be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is awesome, but Let's see if their
roadkill is a true roadkill skunk or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many claims to that I've never
seen one in my life Well, not since I
[SPEAKER_00]: first started smoking anyways during my
breeding life never seen one and There we
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you Do this part of the seed
tutorial?
You
