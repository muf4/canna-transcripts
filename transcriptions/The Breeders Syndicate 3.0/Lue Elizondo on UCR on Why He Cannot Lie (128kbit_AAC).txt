[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but can we say that at least for
right now that the truth is Cloudy can
[SPEAKER_00]: truth be cloudy sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean truth is also it's also relative
There are personal truths and then there
[SPEAKER_01]: are universal truths, right your religion
your cultural affiliations You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are all your political affiliations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are personal truths.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're true to you, but then you have
universal truths Like gravity,
[SPEAKER_01]: right and so therein lies a conundrum.

security Chris There's a reason okay a if
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell the quickest way for me to have my
security clearance revoked or suspended is
[SPEAKER_01]: a if I provide an Unauthorized disclosure
I provide classified information In an
[SPEAKER_01]: unauthorized manner the other way is by
line if I lie just like I can't talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: national secrets I also can't lie to the
American public because that also will
[SPEAKER_01]: hold to be held against me for security
clearance reason So I always have to ride
[SPEAKER_01]: this very fine line and people just assume
all these disinformation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Can't lie to the American people because
I will have my security clearance removed
[SPEAKER_01]: because that is a site what part of the
psychological evaluation someone is a is a
[SPEAKER_01]: is a confirmed Pathological liar that is
an indicator usually of some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: psychological issues those who can't hold
security clearances Also
