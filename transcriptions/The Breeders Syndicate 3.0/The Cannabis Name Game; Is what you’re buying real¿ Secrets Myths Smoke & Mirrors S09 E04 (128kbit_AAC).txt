[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_02]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_02]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_02]: seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_02]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The syndicate is a collection of seed
makers that want to push back against all
[SPEAKER_02]: the smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_02]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew Riot here with my cohost,
thousand fold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today we're going to be discussing
something that it's one of the most
[SPEAKER_02]: important topics in cannabis, not just
breeding, but it's it's an integral part
[SPEAKER_02]: of breeding, which is the name game.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it work?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are its implications?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some variables that go into
selecting and how does affect the outcome
[SPEAKER_02]: of the final flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it work medically or otherwise?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, this is something I'm super
passionate about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been kind of talking about it a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I felt like as an overall arching
theme for this season, one of the things I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to drive home was reaching the end
user of flower, because it's not something
[SPEAKER_02]: something that we deal with a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not they're not our main.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you call that are the people
watching our show?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not our main demographic,
the end user of the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times the people watching our
show are seed makers or people interested
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically in genetics and breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this season, I really want to tap into
them because in the end, they are the
[SPEAKER_02]: people that need to know they are the
consumers and they need to understand what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're putting in their body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this is one of the few ways
that we can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the only things I'll add,
this sort of does apply to seeds as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it sort of does apply to clones as
well, to a degree, in terms of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: broader market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in a way we will be covering
we'll touch on all of those things,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't get enough time,
we'll return to this because this is,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, like Matt said, one of the core
issues that we we want to highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's much else for me
to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, Matt, you want to start with from
a breeder's point of view, initially,
[SPEAKER_00]: what goes into naming something?
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I started thinking about the whole
topic and how we could cover it,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe, or if it was even worth talking
about, I wanted to start from a seed
[SPEAKER_02]: maker's perspective or a breeder's
perspective during my early days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're talking, you know, 2006 to 2012,
right around in that era.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, probably 2006, 2010,
and then before, like obviously before I
[SPEAKER_02]: came in, this is relevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is just from my experience,
how it went.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different breeders had different methods
for coming up with names.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of those had started early on,
whether it was from Neville, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, wow, that bud is awful large
yielding.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a big bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, wow, that one smells skunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you would pick things,
whether it was the scent, the look,
[SPEAKER_02]: any number of things like that,
but really obvious visual cues,
[SPEAKER_02]: scent cues, stuff like that when you were
picking names.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it wasn't like that in the case
of something like AK-47, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But generally speaking, they were pretty
easy to assess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, names were individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: You knew if it was bubble berry,
it was going to be Sager Mathis bubble
[SPEAKER_02]: berry, generally speaking, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Before the white labeling came on and all
the shit shows started.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also the combinations of when you
combine strains, like when we started
[SPEAKER_02]: doing hybrids, you know, let's say you
have a blueberry and a bubble gum,
[SPEAKER_02]: you combine them and now you have bubble
berry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we have, let's say, Girl Scout cookies
and blueberry, now you have cookie berry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, the white cut across the
Phyrogi, now you have white Phyrogi.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were just really simple ways to do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, there wasn't a lot of creativity in
it, but it helped define what you were
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because the name, you knew,
okay, it's going to be like the white,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to be like the fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to see, you know, progeny
somewhere in between the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of how it went.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also, I think, the effect of the
different scale, the number of people who
[SPEAKER_00]: were in the industry back then,
as compared to now, you were saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like back then, conceivably, you could
quite easily search for the name that you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to use and feel like you have kind of
done a little bit of due diligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you wanted to talk about like what
due diligence really meant back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a lot easier to step on toes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of the word we always use,
to avoid it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there weren't a whole lot of us
like people looking in nowadays,
[SPEAKER_02]: like look at history and they see,
you know, tens of thousands of breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: and strains and all this, you know,
all these names.
[SPEAKER_02]: But back then, there wasn't a whole
shitload of people making seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There really wasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was really easy for people to
communicate with each other, though not
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody did communicate back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people obviously were less
communicative than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was also very few reference
sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were, I mean, we knew the forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew where we could search and look for
names to see if it had been used.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot easier to figure that stuff
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, it wasn't, you know, surefire,
but it was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty easy to see if a name had
been used and if you're going to step on
[SPEAKER_02]: toes, and if so, what toes you were going
to step on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just considered it due diligence.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was polite.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if someone was around before you
and had chosen a name before you,
[SPEAKER_02]: it wasn't polite to then take that name,
use what time marketing money they had put
[SPEAKER_02]: into branding.
[SPEAKER_02]: The strain and then take it for yourself
and then try to bump off it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like that in any commodity,
any industry names are meant to identify.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was easier to do due diligence.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nowadays, I think is where we're
heading.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not looking so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not looking so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some examples to you of names
that just don't really mean either what
[SPEAKER_00]: they say or they just don't really mean
anything at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you had a couple of examples.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like recently doing the reviews that
we've been doing on our show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll talk about it some more later
because it's very it very much ties into
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole theme of this season.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've run into some really confusing stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for those who don't know, real quickly,
I've avoided the modern market as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: like what's being pushed or hyped in
collectives and dispensaries, what the
[SPEAKER_02]: hype flower boys and the heady boys are
smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no clue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have zero clue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew what I liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just I saw it as all the same
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I've been trying to dive into it
so I can have an actual educated
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective on it and not just speak from
the hip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been encountering a lot of these
these major clashes in in eras and
[SPEAKER_02]: generations on how we name stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, I saw Blue Zoo.
[SPEAKER_02]: She and I was like, OK, I don't know what
Zushi is right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Blue, that tells me it's going to be a
blueberry hybrid, probably smell
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's because I like blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when I see blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I go for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like things with with that scent,
that smell, that high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look it up and it's like some
weddings, giddles.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no blue in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you come up with blue Zushi?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like and that's the fact of what Zushi is,
who knows, you know, but the the one thing
[SPEAKER_00]: in there that does speak to its lineage is
just the Z, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the Z is in there, so, you know,
it might have some giddles in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if you're lucky, though,
you know, I mean, like nowadays,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know that that means much.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Z might be more popular than the
actual strain skittles now in strain
[SPEAKER_02]: names.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I would bet there's a lot of
stuff out there with Z in it that don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have Z in it, you know, in the actual
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think it's definitely worth
highlighting as well where like just using
[SPEAKER_00]: the letter Z is now like adding adding
something to your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It adds, it adds context.
[SPEAKER_02]: It adds implied context that may not be
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's implied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also based on the breeders or
whatever seed maker's knowledge that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are looking for that in that
signifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want that Z.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, a lot of this I started seeing
with like animal cookies and Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like the first notable examples
to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, granted, there were blueberries
out there that were nothing blue or
[SPEAKER_02]: related, but that was just people,
I think, just really confused on what they
[SPEAKER_02]: had.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like when we got to Girl Scout cookies
and animal cookies, I was fully expecting
[SPEAKER_02]: these things to smell and taste like sweet
cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people say, oh, it's doughy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like maybe to them, but like
doughy is not sweet cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it is not an animal cracker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like these are very far from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, wedding cake, kind of doughy,
kind of creamy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it like, does it smell like sweet
birthday cake or wedding cake?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it taste like it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, before this, would anyone have
been like, yeah, I want some dough turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that I've never I would have never
thought I've never heard that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like you'd be like, oh,
you got that pine, you got that that that
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush got, you know, but I've never I can't
wait to smoke that dough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never had that dough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doughy just sounds to me like something
went wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, what doughy implied was a bad like
a bad expression from Oji Kush or triangle
[SPEAKER_02]: in a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's we're usually run into like the bad
expressions triangle in Oji Kush or the
[SPEAKER_00]: doughiness, which is bad expression or
like bad processing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, when I say bad expression,
it's obviously preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too, because it's not what I prefer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I prefer like very specific ends of
Oji Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I hit that realm, I'm like,
oh, this is the common, goofy end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's move the other direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: But someone found that as a very as their
keeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently it resonated with the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, you know, that is just my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, then we have things like
gushers, gelati, cheetah piss,
[SPEAKER_02]: just whatever name they can throw on shit
that implies so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was seeing leachy taro bun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's these aren't in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and I don't know if it's
psychosomatism that makes people think
[SPEAKER_02]: that this is what they're going to
experience and then therefore experience
[SPEAKER_02]: it like suggestion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or does the modern market not care if the
name resembles what the expectations are
[SPEAKER_02]: setting?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is it is it because I'm old and been
in a long time that I have those
[SPEAKER_02]: expectations?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's something you can comment on,
because you're you're from a different
[SPEAKER_02]: era.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, from a cynical point of view,
it's unsurprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said previously, you could
rely on names actually corresponding with
[SPEAKER_00]: some quality of the plant or some quality
of some some aspect of its lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But increasingly, as the names themselves
have started to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, have their own kind of like
cloud games.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, people would just focus on
engineering names and the names themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: become.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what people make the decisions
based on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'm adding anything new,
but yeah, that's just I mean, like from
[SPEAKER_02]: your perspective, like when you came in
and you started smoking a lot and buying
[SPEAKER_02]: strains, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have expectations that maybe the
skittles would actually taste like
[SPEAKER_02]: skittles?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that that, first of all,
depends on me knowing what skittles even
[SPEAKER_00]: is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really, or I mean, I'm sure I'll put
it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Andy, because of the way the market
works here, it's not like we all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have access to the same information
or it's like a unified scene in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's still really like fragmented
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people are just like skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the skittles candy for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have skittles candy?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I guess I just mean I guess I just
mean that like the quote unquote community
[SPEAKER_00]: or quote unquote industry here isn't
unified enough to kind of have a sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: like what these things actually mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't like a generally accepted
sense of anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from your perspective, your personal
perspective, having like having since you
[SPEAKER_02]: have the candy skittles there,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have that as a kid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're asking, like, you know,
if I see the name skittles, would I
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately make that association?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, did you have the expectation when
you first heard of skittles, the strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably going to be at least,
you know, somewhere in that realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I can I've got a good
anecdote for this, which is that the first
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of seeds I ever bought was called
gorilla skittles and it was from Barney's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be honest with you, when I when I
chose it, it was completely arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just I was so overwhelmed by the
names that were on those websites that I
[SPEAKER_00]: just picked a name that sounded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that just stood out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it seemed even more bizarre than the
other names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, I had very little
appreciation for the history or what any
[SPEAKER_00]: of those things actually meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what you get are photographs,
whatever they've written and whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: other people say about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I think, you know, I definitely have
more to say about later as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, in terms of my initial
experiences looking at these, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at these products, yeah,
it was overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone watching this right now in the
comments below, add in your thoughts like
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm real interested to see one.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was everyone's first seed purchase in
what year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Add that in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, what were your expectations when
buying this and what did you what did you
[SPEAKER_02]: what went into your purchase?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it the grams per square meter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pictures, name, reputation of string.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, in the comments below,
if you can if you can tell us what you
[SPEAKER_02]: think, I'd love to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the seed buying perspective,
a seed buyers perspective kind of talked
[SPEAKER_02]: about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about how we choose names.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, where are we at?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'll just I'll say a bit more on
seed buying, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you if you're new and you look at a
seed bank website and look at the names.
[SPEAKER_00]: You you you won't have a sense of like
what's important slash popular yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you won't you won't necessarily know
what ChemDog means or what sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oji Kush means or what GorillaGlue means
or Skittles yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the absence of having any
context historically, you do then
[SPEAKER_00]: gravitate towards brand names that you are
familiar with or strong associations like
[SPEAKER_00]: you were talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the game, you know,
that's where it gets it gets crazy because
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have is, you know, in terms of you
looking at these things, all the
[SPEAKER_00]: information that you get is like,
yeah, photographs, whatever arbitrary
[SPEAKER_00]: information they've decided to include,
whatever kind of thing within branding
[SPEAKER_00]: they've developed around these products
and maybe some like social media
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions that you get to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, and at this point,
it's kind of like this is why like a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of people ask me why I got into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: When did I get into history?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was because I realized, like,
kind of once I started seeing all this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff going through the logic of seed
buying, I was spending my money on seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd already taken a big dive at one point
on a massive purchase from Amsterdam on a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of Dutch companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized at one point, all I have is
info from these people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to know who the people are giving
me this info and are they reliable?
[SPEAKER_02]: That that was the point of where I
realized I need to see who these people
[SPEAKER_02]: are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, are they are they good researchers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they passing on reliable info?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something they're making up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they the type of person who would make
something up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they have a history?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of this?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's when that all became
really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and that's when I started my journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I started asking, like,
at this point between grower to buyer,
[SPEAKER_02]: is there any chance someone would have a
motive to change the name on what they
[SPEAKER_02]: purchased as a clone or a seed to meet
market demand?
[SPEAKER_02]: How likely is that to occur?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how often do we think that is
occurring?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's that's when all those
questions came and started swelling to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, maybe maybe this is a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me to introduce a little analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually something it's a it's
an article written by a writer journalist
[SPEAKER_00]: called Jenny O'Dell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's called There's No Such Thing as a
Free Watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't go into too much detail that I
would say that the the piece itself is an
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing read for those of you who are
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll give you a little a little
rundown on what she discovered and what
[SPEAKER_00]: this is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know exactly where she picks up
this lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she basically finds online that there
are a couple of stores advertising this
[SPEAKER_00]: very generic looking watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of just imagine like a vaguely
modern minimalist looking watch that,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, is not very offensive,
but is is also not super distinctive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she starts looking around and she
starts finding the exact same watch being
[SPEAKER_00]: sold by all these different e-commerce
stores online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way it's being sold is one of two
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, they say for a limited time only,
you get this watch for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to pay for shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's one side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other side of it is they just say,
OK, it was fifty dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's marked down to ten dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty classic schemes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go on onto these shops,
you know, it'll have these fake tickers
[SPEAKER_00]: that are like, oh, look, like people are
buying it like live right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see like the numbers dropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you better you better get
it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she starts looking around a bit
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: She starts examining the shop itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she notices a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, when she looks at the photographs of
the shop and all that, she does some
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse image searches and she finds that
the branding for the store itself is all
fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the photographs, like for example,
this store is meant to be based in like a
[SPEAKER_00]: hip part of San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are photographs of like an
actual physical shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does a reverse image search.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that shop, that photograph
actually belongs to some other shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, no relation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she looked into like the address and
it's not a real not a real address.
[SPEAKER_00]: She looked into the writing that they have
on the about page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been ripped from like,
I don't know, like the San Francisco like
[SPEAKER_00]: city council website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the branding information around the
store itself is all fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one level.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the photographs are fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: She goes deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: She starts trying to find out how many
stores actually sell the same generic
[SPEAKER_00]: looking watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she finds like a whole bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're apparently in all these hip
cities, Madrid, London, Paris.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all selling the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call them different names and the
branding's changed, but they're the same
[SPEAKER_00]: watch.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then she goes even deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: She tries to find out where the watches
even come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quite quickly she gets to like Alibaba
and these like Chinese wholesalers slash
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the crazy part here is that she can
never find who actually has been
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing these.
[SPEAKER_00]: She finds a network of quote unquote
suppliers that I, they are listed as like
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers slash wholesalers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just this crazy human
centipede of like drop shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, for those of you, for those of you who
don't know, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop shipping is when the shop never
actually touches or handles any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can order from a customer and they
simply send that order to the warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fulfillment place.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether that place is where they actually
make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or where they actually fulfill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be another intermediary.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's basically this,
you can already see the possibility of
[SPEAKER_00]: there being like a whole chain of drop
shippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like this person's drop
shipping, but the, that who they're buying
[SPEAKER_00]: it from is also drop shipping and who
they're buying from is also drop shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just, it's this like endless,
endless chain of like fake goods and no
[SPEAKER_00]: accountability and no actual origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, I think that like the
analogies between something like that and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, I think there's a lot of
crossover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tons.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the other day, a bunch of us
watched a documentary called Telemark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was on HBO.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy, Patrick J.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pespas and his friends did a, it started
off that they were just like junkies or
[SPEAKER_02]: one was a junkie and one was like a young
kid at a telemarketing job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were just filming how wild it was
at their job where they were getting paid
[SPEAKER_02]: to pretend to be policemen calling for the
policeman's balls to seeing if you would
[SPEAKER_02]: donate to officers such and such.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a similar idea to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw it very, so many parallels to
our cannabis community because between
[SPEAKER_02]: that phone and, and that the actual like
dude using heroin on the other line,
[SPEAKER_02]: the perception to the person on the other
end of the line is that this is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, officer Joe McDonald,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's perception is everything,
absolutely everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when there's a barrier there,
there is some level of faith that has to
[SPEAKER_02]: go into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've always felt like if you can
mitigate faith, the more you can mitigate
[SPEAKER_02]: faith and and get to actual hard data,
the better off you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because just, just drawing on that watch
analogy for a bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other observations she made was
how it was being validated online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these, these quote unquote shops,
they would have Instagram accounts with a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch of followers.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their followers were what she called quote
unquote aspirational influencers,
[SPEAKER_00]: people who might didn't have like,
they maybe had like around a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: followers each.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not big yet, but they have,
they do have some visibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is that there's a kind of
mutualism, a kind of symbiosis that
[SPEAKER_00]: happens between this fake shop and these
quote unquote influences where the fake
[SPEAKER_00]: shop gives these influences more exposure
and the influences also give the fake shop
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure and they validate each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cosine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going back to what you're saying about
perception, well, it's partly a product of
[SPEAKER_00]: the internet, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now anyone can have, you can basically
magic a brand out of nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you no longer need premises.
[SPEAKER_00]: You no longer need like all these like
traditional infrastructure, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can play all these games
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause now you're just playing almost like
a pure information game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a confidence game you can use to
manipulate the information space.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's information warfare, PsyOps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every step of the way it is,
I mean, realistically it sounds extreme,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a confidence game.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I talk about co-signing a lot,
I talk, a lot of people ask me why I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have certain readers interviewed on this
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I try to, you know, every once in a
while I have sort of an explain it to
[SPEAKER_02]: them, but realistically, when I have,
when I bring people on the show,
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to account for not just who they are
right now and what they're presenting to
[SPEAKER_02]: me right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also am, I'm trying to predict whether
these people are always going to continue
[SPEAKER_02]: to operate in this manner and be good
people, because you know how complicated
[SPEAKER_02]: life can get and, and, you know,
someone suddenly loses everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, sometimes you can be moral fluid
and, and the things they wouldn't do
[SPEAKER_02]: before for money now become a viable
option.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just watched our whole cannabis market
tangs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I choose what readers to bring on,
it's normally people that I am,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very, very long acquainted with and
that I'm willing to, in a sense,
[SPEAKER_02]: co-sign a bit because I'm willing to say
like, if I bring them on and have a
[SPEAKER_02]: serious heart to heart conversation with
them, people will have the perception that
[SPEAKER_02]: not only we are friends, but that I
believe everything they're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because I know that perception is
there, I do not want to bring on people
[SPEAKER_02]: that I don't necessarily believe or trust
and then leave it up to the people
[SPEAKER_02]: watching to figure that out because,
you know, we're just presenting something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't live with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and when people ask me about certain
breeders, it's not even necessarily that I
[SPEAKER_02]: think they're bad breeders and haven't had
them on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just because I don't know them well
enough to put my own, my own co-sign on
[SPEAKER_02]: the line, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not necessarily speaking out
against people if they're not on,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just that safety measure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that safety measure is there because
of perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just to, I think just to
really, really drill the point home,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A fake watch is actually easier to verify
than say seats, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the fake watch, you look at it,
it's in your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it work?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's its quality like?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can verify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it look like it's supposed to?
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least if you bought a fake watch,
you know whether or not you're being
[SPEAKER_00]: scammed.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did want to say, right, the point
being the major point being cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically is even more ripe for
exploitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were talking about flour before
Matt, but imagine you're buying seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you and I talked about this a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before the recording, but I think this is
the point I was trying to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds themselves are a promise of
plants.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, you know, we've talked about genetic
variability before odds, probability,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that, that comes into play,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are a promise of flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the end result of all of that is
processed flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have yet another stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically from the beginning point of
seeds to the end point of consumable
[SPEAKER_00]: flour, you actually have multiple leaps to
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you get in a chain of leaps
like that or chain of promises like that
[SPEAKER_00]: is deniability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have both, you can both play
in this realm of plausibility and
[SPEAKER_00]: deniability.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone wasn't happy with what you did
with what they got, you could say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, but it could have been, you could have
just messed up at any of these points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a way to deny like your
responsibility as the breeder or seed
[SPEAKER_00]: maker.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even if you're, even if you're a
legitimate breeder or seed maker,
[SPEAKER_00]: like this, this sucks for you as well,
because if someone comes to you and says,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I didn't get what I thought I was
going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to now troubleshoot and try to
figure out at which stage something could
[SPEAKER_00]: have gone wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, I imagine it must be so crazy to
have some of these troubleshooting
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations with people as someone who
actually does care and is trying to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that like people are getting what you
promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, honestly, for me,
it's been very, I'm constantly the bearer
[SPEAKER_02]: of bad news.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've kind of just come to live with
that, you know, like whether it's new
[SPEAKER_02]: people in our discord, asking questions
about some like Barney's farm or whoever,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like, I'm just going to have to
open some doors that they haven't heard
[SPEAKER_02]: yet, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it comes to stuff like that,
because like, you know, there are a few of
[SPEAKER_02]: us who actually like test our lines,
know what we're working with and run them
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't run into a whole lot of people
having issues with what I'm telling them
[SPEAKER_02]: the line is going to be like, not being
like in the end, even if it's badly grown,
[SPEAKER_02]: usually there's some representation there
to where people are like, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem comes if you're using seed
banks, because now you've got a middle man
[SPEAKER_02]: in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, let's say they get seeds and these
seeds didn't pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you're selling them direct and
you know the seeds are still popping for
[SPEAKER_02]: other customers, you have them there with
you and you can pop them there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet they're not having them pop there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to then think, okay, how are they
storing them at the seed bank?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there any problem with them getting
cooked on the way in the mail between
[SPEAKER_02]: point A to point B or point B to point C?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did they pop them?
[SPEAKER_02]: What methods are they using?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they wash their fucking hands?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like any number of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's usually where trickiness
comes into play, is seed banks for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And okay, no, that's a really good insight
as well, because I did want to hear a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But okay, even if we move to flower,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower as a product instead of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there we can say, okay, the chain's
been shortened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like the person has to grow it
out and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the flower is the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even then, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How we judge flower is extremely
subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you pointed out before that how you
judge smell, how you judge effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like those are firm, universal,
objective things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even with flower, you still run into
all of this subjective uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you come up against the limits of your
judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You come up against the limits of what you
can communicate to each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also, again, it depends on
education too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one of the review things that I've
been doing is something we're starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: call legit or nah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have no better name for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was from my point of view,
as I started looking into some of the new
[SPEAKER_02]: hype market, looking into these new names
and trying these strengths and strains
[SPEAKER_02]: out, seeing if they are anything like
they're claiming to be or their lineages,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also been kind of interested in
seeing if any of the old clones that we
[SPEAKER_02]: have kept all these years and that I know
flower of real well, if I can go into the
[SPEAKER_02]: modern collective dispensary market,
see that on a menu, pick it out and
[SPEAKER_02]: reliably get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the percentage?
[SPEAKER_02]: In what city?
[SPEAKER_02]: All these are data points to me and I'm
fascinated by it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those recent ones I did was
something called Louis the 13th OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did a review on it and you can see
that on our channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, you know, I did the review.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was at least it was a very,
it was an OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grow was decent of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The handling of it was absolutely
horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was an owner of a company,
I would never put weed that looked like
[SPEAKER_02]: that in bags and sell it like no way in
hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because it was better than the other
OG Kushes I had bought, which it was a
[SPEAKER_02]: terrible margin of, it was bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bleak out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a second one and I got it for a few
reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, my chick really likes OG Kush and
that was the closest one there was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, I want that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's helping me right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, that's ugly, but all right,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And quickly to illustrate real quick,
I'm going to pop these up on the screen so
[SPEAKER_02]: that there is some kind of, so you guys
can have some kind of idea of what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is, so here, can you see it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it showing up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, we good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have the first batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not particularly wonderful looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can tell, it's dark green.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been handled.
[SPEAKER_02]: The oils are smashed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't put this in a package,
but it was actually decent to smoke,
[SPEAKER_02]: oddly enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, looks aren't necessarily
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the second batch that I got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as you could tell, this is not the
same bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not even the same structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: This looks like a GG4 hybrid to me,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from the smell of it, it was kind of
berry gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at this point, my lady, I run into the
problem that I was initially trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: My lady liked the other Louis because it
helped her headache at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got a second bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: One week, not even a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the last one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And same name, same batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what shows up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's nothing like the first one from
the same batch, same bag, same company,
[SPEAKER_02]: same delivery service, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at this point, I'm like, okay,
now I want to see how they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: handle this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I wonder how often this comes up
that someone's like, hey, you didn't give
[SPEAKER_02]: me the, you didn't give me real Louis the
13th OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I doubt that ever happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like where people like can identify a
strain or like, this isn't it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like does that happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hit him up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit him up as just any random dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hit up the delivery service and
actually they were fast to respond.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were like, okay, well,
I need to contact the owner of this
[SPEAKER_02]: company and I'll let them know that there
was an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the owner of that company, and I'll
leave them nameless for now, but you can
[SPEAKER_02]: see it in the review, wrote me back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, hi, this is Blank from our
friends at Blank told us that you were
[SPEAKER_02]: unhappy with the flower purchase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm so sorry to hear that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have told them that we will totally have
them switch out the King Louis flower bag
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can pick any of the other flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a different cut of King Louis OG
this time around because we always package
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh to order.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have about five different in-house
growers that we rotate flavors with based
[SPEAKER_02]: on harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can keep the same flavors in
rotation and guarantee freshness.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely an OG, but not the same
cut as before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry for the inconvenience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always aim to please our patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would never want you to walk away
unsatisfied.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you have a great rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have been notified with the
deliveries to switch it out for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, makes sense then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate the response on why medicine
can't be relied on to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering why that would be so
vastly different.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a seed maker, that's an aspect I look
at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget from the commercial cultivation
side, how that goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiple growers pushing to one spot,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I said this is because I
wanted him to admit, yeah, I'm just a
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pushing other people that are actually
growers flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know what the hell I'm talking
about, but he doubled down.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, as you know, with breeding,
different phenotypes come out expressed
[SPEAKER_02]: differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to be as consistent as possible,
but there being so many phenotypes of
[SPEAKER_02]: classic strains, some growers prefer to
stick with certain phenos that respond
[SPEAKER_02]: better to their formula or their growing
style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for being understanding and
sorry about the confusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would never want patients to think that
we are doing the bait and switch.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did thank him and say, no, I am not
interested in a replacement.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not why I did this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never got the replacement because I
just wasn't interested in see if you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: actually follow through with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was interested in his response since
Luigi is a cut, a clone only, not a seed
[SPEAKER_02]: line.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are not multiple phenotypes of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can express differently, but it would
not turn from OG Christian to very in
[SPEAKER_02]: gorilla group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just, yeah, to me, that's just some
very slippery rhetoric.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's similar to what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was similar to what I was saying to you
about like, if you're like a scammy seed
[SPEAKER_00]: dealer seed maker, you can just pretend
that like, oh, it's because you messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point of the process,
whether this or that, this one is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I guess, praying.
[SPEAKER_02]: He tried to use breeder speak on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, well, you know, type and
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also like praying on like ignorance,
not your ignorance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you knew that it didn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to say, you can't just say it's a
clone, but also it's not a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a bunch of different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of it made any sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, how can he say he did not bait
and switch knowing that that's not Louis
[SPEAKER_02]: the 13th OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like literally what he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different cut of OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why would you put it in a bag when the
end goal on your packaging says that this
[SPEAKER_02]: is medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that to me is like the, the one factor
that kills me because the only reason that
[SPEAKER_02]: we have ever been able in California to be
able to grow this plant with any kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like safety or safeguard or any safeness
in our hearts is because of the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: community, generally ill patients,
cancer patients, people like that pushing
[SPEAKER_02]: super hard to make this available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was all done off their backs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at this point, they can't even go and
get reliable medicine from these places at
[SPEAKER_02]: a reasonable price.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, it's just like a, so many things
have gone so wrong, but it's being carried
[SPEAKER_02]: as being done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a lot of, there's a lot of
issues everywhere and people don't even
[SPEAKER_02]: know that there are issues going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even know that there are
questions to ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know about these variables.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of assumptions along the
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there's anything that I,
if I can twist anything in my whole
[SPEAKER_02]: career, it would be to flip that on its
head and make people see it for what it
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we, the guy himself has given us
an insight into what his game is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to bring it back to seats for a
moment again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we've talked about this many
times, but the obvious analogy I was
[SPEAKER_00]: drawing with the watch, the whole watch
thing, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that in some situations, these seeds
are being wholesales white labeled by some
[SPEAKER_00]: nameless source somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are getting a hold of these seeds,
rebranding them, repackaging them,
[SPEAKER_00]: remarketing them, or sorry, not
remarketing, but marketing them and
[SPEAKER_00]: remarketing in many cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remarketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of times when they're buying
the bulk seeds from a bulk seller,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not buying the strain that they're
selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're buying something that maybe,
maybe resembles the strain they're
[SPEAKER_02]: selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes in many cases, in many
companies, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, like, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever seen Acapulco gold flower,
you know, 10 weeks look like that all
[SPEAKER_02]: dense?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, 60, 70 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Close enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just one of many examples,
you know, like things that people can
[SPEAKER_02]: easily point to and be like, okay,
purple punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what purple punch looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a very specific look and a resin
profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's not it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, it's just not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, but they still list here,
genetics, granddaddy purple, Larry OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're giving the genetics from,
it'll come back to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we spend a bit of time here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you go and look at that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I, the more I thought about it
when we, when you mentioned, I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: do we need to pull this up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause because they are the biggest
offenders in my opinion of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's their chem dog?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they not have it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have a search?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just do the search for the Addish
mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what their search shows for chem
dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Search.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I, should I PDAWG?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably the best bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow.
None.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just, just go chem and see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we have?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have chem dog from Blimburn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Narrow-leafed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And genetics clone of chem 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blimburn seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's one chem dog you have a shot
at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's Blimburn's Ken Thor, which you
couldn't tell anything from this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is way too early, but yeah,
no, definitely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem Thor.
[SPEAKER_02]: American genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we go to Bioneys actually?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you, I know there's Bioneys on
here, but can you go to the actual Bioneys
[SPEAKER_00]: website?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it still showing the search page?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it on that same page?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the same page you were on before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have to switch things real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop screen, present, share screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where's Barney's?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Share.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good old Barney.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go chem again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just do a little chem survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this is going to be real
fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem and try that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there's no chem here on Barney's farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a chem.
[SPEAKER_02]: The closest you're going to get is like
GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_02]: That picture actually looks like GMO,
which is funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that they're probably like
using a GMO hybrid for the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's another really recognizable one?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the OG or something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OG Kush is super recognized.
[SPEAKER_02]: See if Barney's farm ever got themselves a
real live OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least in pictures we can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: See all results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubba is another easy one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: OG Kush auto.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually looks like an OG Kush plant in
the picture too, but it looks like a boofy
[SPEAKER_02]: ass OG Kush, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the shape, that football
shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You also see that in Day Wrecker too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That similar shape of the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very heavy and prominent in Day
Wrecker, except Day Wrecker has a more
[SPEAKER_02]: chem 91 bud type and like has that leaf
cannibalism stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever I talk about football shapes on
OG, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to interject and say that
like in cannabis, it's not quite as
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe as the watch story that I told,
like as far as I know, no one's doing drop
[SPEAKER_00]: shipping yet, but it's probably not far
away the way things are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's very, it's going to happen soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the main thing that was going on for a
long time was in the two thousands,
[SPEAKER_02]: a company in Spain started and they were
supplying Barney's farm, greenhouse seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: Sensi, Nirvana, and several others.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the main ones that they were,
they were supplying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one company with a list of like
feminine seeds that they could choose
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously when this started to make
them millions of dollars really fast,
[SPEAKER_02]: other companies popped up that were bigger
and came.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when them popped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And almost anything you buy from Barney's
farm, any of these guys has come from the
[SPEAKER_02]: past 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of it was supplied by them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it, who knows what you get in the
end.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't really care, but that was,
that was as close to drop shipping as it
[SPEAKER_02]: got, but at some point they got lit up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was funny was not fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: If none of it's funny when people get lit
up like that, but the odd part about it
[SPEAKER_02]: was when it got hit by the Spanish
authorities, their site went down or not
[SPEAKER_02]: site went down.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put a warning up on their site about
it saying like, Oh, you know, this has
[SPEAKER_02]: been taken offline.
[SPEAKER_02]: The identical message was up on their
website because they are the same company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people don't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a Spanish company.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's, there are good,
decent people that own it, but like,
[SPEAKER_02]: are they breeding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe one might make some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every now and then, but do they,
is that the seeds they're selling now?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where it gets hairy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, are they doing their own
projects and breeding and into weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what they're selling?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the majority of seeds are selling?
No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and as much as I like the guys,
that's, that's, that's the honest truth on
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the, in, in the watch thing,
I think I mentioned that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: she basically came to the conclusion that
a whole bunch of these different shops
[SPEAKER_00]: were actually just run by the same person
and they just, each of them had different
[SPEAKER_00]: branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was the same, same person running
all of it and just getting it from the
[SPEAKER_00]: same warehouse.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, in the U S it's starting to
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing these big old seed makers pop
up in like Salinas, Santa Barbara,
[SPEAKER_02]: doing these massive FEM pollinations
outdoors and selling these as FEM seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: for cookies or for, that's where all those
seeds come from.
[SPEAKER_02]: For, doesn't, they're all just FEM,
Buffy, outdoor produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are, these reps of this company
are nowhere near this shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know the seeds don't touch their
fucking hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: They aren't selecting one big smoke and
mirrors campaign.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you know, like I see their
comments with people, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: People get pitched at me all the time
because they say, I have nothing nice to
[SPEAKER_02]: say about other breeders, but I don't
think I'm talking about other breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm talking about people that sell
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I talk about other breeders,
I speak with admiration and respect
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the hard job.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may as well just start calling these
people drop shippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Realistically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop shippers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marketing drop shippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want you to look at one more website
because this one has some personal
[SPEAKER_00]: significance to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted it in the, in the chat,
in our chat here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can pull it up,
but I'll give a bit of context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I found the syndicate,
I was on a forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to name the forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this forum was hooked up to this
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look at this website, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's made by bots for bots.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all the Barney farm pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recognize them, but look at the
aesthetic of the website, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look like it's, it's for humans
or that it was by humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like generic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so this forum that I was on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was basically trying to funnel these white
label seeds down their forum members
[SPEAKER_00]: throats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, this was like a major
sponsor saying, Hey, you can get like
[SPEAKER_00]: cookie as ones from weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my old strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone was growing these seeds and
everyone was so happy about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, cause no one that has experience was
going to be going buying these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and spending their money here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the only people they were going to be
getting are people that are new,
[SPEAKER_02]: that are so happy that they've gotten
through their first run of something they
[SPEAKER_02]: can smoke regardless of quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they're new.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's praying on people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the other thing I think that
freaks me out is that this is this website
[SPEAKER_00]: is just one example of like thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as generic and as faceless as this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look what they did to green crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this ugly ass picture they chose
for green crack.
Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they get OG Kush right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't even put a picture of OG Kush
under OG Kush, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that goes to show you like the people
that are putting these strains together
[SPEAKER_02]: and these sites together, they don't even
know enough to use a picture of OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know what OG Kush looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's to me, like that's one
of those keys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, dude, if your breeder
doesn't know what OG Kush looks like,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably shouldn't be buying seeds from
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if this is being shoved down your
throat at some forums, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: why wouldn't this be the forum says that's
what people use, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They got peanut butter breath after all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this poor plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another one, Amsterdam marijuana
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that another one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, there's so many, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, this is the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the generic seed bank name,
you can think of probably exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the one that's been around like
forever and has never f***ed off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam marijuana seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl Scout cookies extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't see the tab, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's why.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is the one, like whenever I hear
people talking about like their their
[SPEAKER_02]: first experiences, usually for some
reason, they end up at Amsterdam marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and see if this is the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a horrible, horrible plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't want to grow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the website says generic is the last
one as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's the same kind of shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's like, I want people to have
better than this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want this to be the first
place that they go and get ripped off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like this should for people's
first seed buying experience shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_02]: getting ripped off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks because it's a data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas we we almost treat it now like
it's the norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, if you just start, you're going to
get ripped off and then hopefully you
[SPEAKER_00]: learn and then you stop getting ripped
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the norm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's sad because it is the norm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we see it when people come to our our
discord now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's the first thing we hear is,
bro, you don't know how many times I got
[SPEAKER_02]: ripped off before I got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the plant on the screen,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how talk of those leaves are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dear.
[SPEAKER_02]: No hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: No hope for any of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it was like, you know,
you go first.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say, like,
I think you also did want to talk more
[SPEAKER_00]: about collectives as middlemen within the
context of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can also keep bagging.
[SPEAKER_00]: On these these websites.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could do this endlessly, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you have to be its own section on the
show one day because it's just like you
[SPEAKER_02]: can go through these sites and literally
help people like give them sets of logic
[SPEAKER_02]: to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like as I'm breaking down this specific
strain on this page, I can explain why all
[SPEAKER_02]: the things that I look at that are are key
factors to me and why this is fake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what would trigger this for me as a
person who's been in this business a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would I not look at that and see it's
fake?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that would that might be an
important tool for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people just want their
hand held and ask, like, is it fake or
[SPEAKER_02]: not?
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point, again, you're relying
on the faith of someone, whether it's me
[SPEAKER_02]: or someone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're asking someone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's always better to have the logic
tools in your in your box so you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: getting my agenda.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not getting anyone's agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we want to get towards that that
that process of thinking towards the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you did set out some points about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how about we return to Flowerland for
a bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you did want to talk about
Flowerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't want to talk about collectives
and the kind of role that they've had as
[SPEAKER_00]: middlemen within flower, like the context
of flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so with it, I think this is where it's
at with the yeah, with the burgeoning of
[SPEAKER_02]: the gray, the gray quasi legal scene,
we started seeing collectives with menus
[SPEAKER_02]: of options.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we saw more growers starting to feel
more availability and less knowledge about
[SPEAKER_02]: the actual crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the menus have grown substantially.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a long list of names to a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that wasn't necessarily the way it
always was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like at the beginning of California
collective summer, it was like Sensi Star,
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was like seven or eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get urban poison, blueberry,
a few more white widow, white rhino.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's generally what you would
expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a large menu thrown at your
face.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we have a middleman between
between the grower, the person growing the
[SPEAKER_02]: crops and popping the seeds, possibly even
popping the seeds, because sometimes the
[SPEAKER_02]: grower isn't even the person who pops the
seeds or sources the clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have another middleman in
between the flower and the end user.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a whole other variable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see, each collective dispensary
is working with many growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the person talked about in that text,
they said specifically, we are working
[SPEAKER_02]: with many growers and we want to filter it
into one spot, being the mylar packaging
[SPEAKER_02]: place where they stamp their label.
[SPEAKER_02]: They stamp the strain name on it,
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many growers, one spot, all of whom have
individual agendas to move weed from their
[SPEAKER_02]: pockets to the collective at the highest
price point possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the collective in turn is also wanting
to make points on their packages.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they also have an agenda to maximize
the name value to move it from the pockets
[SPEAKER_02]: to the retail customer's pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: With name value and hype and social media,
Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, the
[SPEAKER_02]: invention of Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, names have gone and become far
more important in the sale than anything
[SPEAKER_02]: except for pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And pictures are not worth a thousand
words anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the invention of AI pictures,
the invention of just, people just taking
[SPEAKER_02]: each other's pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't tell the tale anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, what else we got?
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many agendas for maximizing
value and getting points off a package.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the term that we use in
cannabis and it's used in many other
[SPEAKER_02]: areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's points on a package.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a finite number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say the total number of amount you
can get off this package is 3,000 denaro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to get flagged for
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody's trying to get their piece
out of that 3,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a finite number of percentages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody's trying to maximize their
value out of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at some point, they start adding on,
what's it called?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fake value, for the best way into putting
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're adding on fake value.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's not just 3,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's add a different name to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's got 4,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this is more interesting to all of us
along the way, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But what if we change the picture to 5,000
a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's all these different agendas
along the way and each person is trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: maximize value at each turn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a lot of human effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of human error and faith to put
in a lot of people who don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: have any reason to have the history in
mind or research in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of that comes into play when it comes
to the wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to be really bold here, you mean
someone's growing something, but then
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, oh, it's not selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to call it gelato instead
and then raise the price kind of thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least then be able to move it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can move this at 3,000 a pound is
gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or let's say we can move this 3,000 a
pound to screen crack.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's only 3,000 to spread between
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So gelato is kind of a hot name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move it to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now there's 4,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that we call it gelato, we can move
from 4,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now things are looking up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's morals become more fluid at
that point, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: History, research, none of that makes any
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: The end user not having their headache or
not throwing up it at the end of the day
[SPEAKER_02]: becomes a lot less important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely irrelevant, not important,
just not relevant whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It never gets taken into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to extend what you were saying
earlier as well about how, OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: now we're saying the names don't really
mean enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pictures don't mean enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even what they're writing about,
what they're selling doesn't mean enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like, I think the next thing
that people go to is who's repping them on
[SPEAKER_00]: social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the watch thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of pointed out that even if people
aren't actually happy with what they've
[SPEAKER_00]: got, there's a symbiotic relationship here
that could be at play where the growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: quote unquote, or the consumers of the
flower, quote unquote, have an incentive
[SPEAKER_00]: to still share the product if they want
exposure themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the place they're either buying the
seeds or flowers from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they then now have their own
entrenched agenda, regardless of the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of the seeds or flower,
because now they can be promoted if they
[SPEAKER_00]: are promoting this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They themselves can get clout out of it,
conceivably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, that's to me how the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: industry was built.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a bunch of cosines off of shitty
strains, not one breeder in the mix,
[SPEAKER_02]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was people with big social media
accounts, you know, like it started off to
[SPEAKER_02]: me, like just for example, with the
example with Y East, wonderful,
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderful dude, made seeds, did real
selections, made real crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had a marketing guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that marketing guy was a better
talker behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily like physically a talker,
that guy can't talk for shit, but he was a
[SPEAKER_02]: better liar schmoozer and sneakier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while the man doing the work was making
these pretty decent looking strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: the person that was doing the deals on the
back end was moving up the food chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the marketing guy became the breeder
by snaking his own breeder out and then
[SPEAKER_02]: figuring out that you can buy bulk seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how that worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing that killed me was that
every time I saw someone supporting that
[SPEAKER_02]: specific company, after this had happened,
to me it was like, you are spending money
[SPEAKER_02]: against breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're spending money against breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what you're telling the whole
community by doing this is that we prop up
[SPEAKER_02]: guys that are marketers that push breeders
out and that sell us bullshit and sell us
[SPEAKER_02]: lies.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we prop up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how I looked at it from my
perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously that's not realistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously people didn't know all the
backstory, but it also comes down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: point of like, who's going to tell the
backstory?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who wants to take all that heat for
telling the backstory?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who wants to be the person telling
everyone at every angle that Santa's dead?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a fun position to be in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I always said, I always used to think
to tell people, I'd get mad at them and
[SPEAKER_02]: say, do your research, do your research,
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at one point I realized there's
nowhere for people to go do research
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore on these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're getting towards what we
might want to recommend to people as like
[SPEAKER_00]: a process or at least generally to go
through if you are unsure about a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think also maybe I just do a little
summary of what, of kind of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions that we've the suboptimal
conditions that we've outlined in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower and seed markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're just pointing it out in
the seed market and the flower market,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a whole supply chain potentially
of different actors who each have
[SPEAKER_00]: different agendas at different stages of
the chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the possibility of like,
what are we going to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a grower, like I mentioned,
and we're talking about growing seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: your ability to kind of like properly vet
what you're growing is really difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: just due to the nature of the plant and
the complexity of all the different stages
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plant and the flower have to go
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the issue of like provenance.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one other issue too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you kind of gesture to it,
but it is the fact that there is a good,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, eight month to year period
before you see that the actual flower from
[SPEAKER_02]: the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during that time, it's eight to eight
months to a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you pop it right away that you've gone
from the purchase, like, do you even talk
[SPEAKER_02]: to that breeder anymore?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, well, will they have any
communication with you at that point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it, does it matter all that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that piss you off anymore that you're
so far removed from the purchase is really
[SPEAKER_02]: worth the effort to go, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of factors that come into
play about why this, this scam works
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, many, uh, basically many,
let's say what's a good term for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many gaps, uh, between,
yeah, they, they just like so many gaps
[SPEAKER_00]: in, in, in these like chains and,
and like chains of production and supply,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that we, uncertainty and dishonesty
can enter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that those, those gaps aren't
really that well known, like outside of
[SPEAKER_02]: our discord and our friends and our friend
group and some seed makers, like most
[SPEAKER_02]: people don't know that, you know,
this company is not making their own
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people don't know that this breeder
doesn't even grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: This breeder doesn't even smoke,
let alone grow, you know, like they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, but it exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think at this point, people listening
in who are learning or hearing about this
[SPEAKER_00]: for the first time might start feeling
really, uh, how would I put it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really disillusioned about the whole
thing, which is a fair feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it is disillusioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really depressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I also think that we do want to
say that you can do something about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to just start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can start digging into the
possible ways that you can try to verify
[SPEAKER_00]: that what you've bought, whether it's
flour or seeds, um, is legitimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm, I'm actually interested to hear
from your point of view, what you've
[SPEAKER_02]: learned up till this point, where you
would start right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, let's say, um, you wanted to buy
something that had basically some kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: skunky undertone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where, where would you start to research?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's a really, that's where a lot
of people start.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exceptionally hard to research skunky
anything because there are so many con
[SPEAKER_02]: artists running around with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I, yeah, I don't know if I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're smart, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can answer this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what would you start that now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with the knowledge that I have
now, um, number one, I think I know a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better which, which clones or lines to
look at, or at least which names to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for to begin with, you know, even if I
didn't have skunk, you know, in mind or
[SPEAKER_00]: super skunk in mind, I think I would know,
okay, let's start sniffing around chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look around diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look around diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can look for super skunk as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so there's, there's kind of like
me knowing basically like some strain
[SPEAKER_00]: history.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second aspect is now knowing networks
of people and knowing the people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: involved, given the history.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the next place I would look.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you get to the point of where you
were studying the history though?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I mean, you have to go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the first thing was like me
trawling through all these bullshit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, white label seed sites and at
least starting to get what the big names
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like pre pre-learning,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre breeder syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just data, picking up data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's more about like analyzing
frequencies of names, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then being like, okay, Oh gee,
Kush is clearly a big name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem dog, clearly a big name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think it wasn't long after
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started getting into people's reviews,
like strain reviews on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, stuff like what you're
doing now, but way worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause even in there, I was like,
this is so variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just sounds like complete rubbish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like so many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's when I started to get
towards more like long form media,
[SPEAKER_00]: like conversations with breeders,
conversations with growers, and eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: found my way to breed a syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was around that point that
basically started getting interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: what the oral history histories were.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what made you decide to,
uh, like kind of settle at breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: syndicate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that, that, that is, I mean,
most people, you know, this, these guys
[SPEAKER_02]: suck too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can generalize here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that a breeder syndicate,
you could actually try to trace lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean lines of like in terms of
like seed lines, I just mean like lines of
[SPEAKER_00]: like logic and actually get somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you could actually find a person and
actually ask them things and they would,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would tell you things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas like I, when you look elsewhere,
you just come up to, you just get dead
[SPEAKER_00]: ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like the, it was like the
journalists looking for the source of the
[SPEAKER_00]: watches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would just, it would just be this
endless, like, uh, yeah, there's no way
[SPEAKER_00]: you could have surfaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way you could have gotten to
the end of the day, unless you had like
[SPEAKER_02]: connections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And connections into the seed vein.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way there's nothing saying
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like these seeds are actually made by,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, the other way I looked at it was,
is the person making these seeds one,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a, like did, have they published
anything about what they've done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Had they told any stories about their
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they said, have they documented in
any form like, um, yeah, either provenance
[SPEAKER_00]: or process, you know, either one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often even that criteria people fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then the third thing, and if not
that, can I even identify a person in this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, are they even individual names
being mentioned or is it just a faceless
[SPEAKER_00]: organization and most of them entity
faceless?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an entity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, let me, I'll recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, um, one, is there a line of,
uh, thought or logic I can trace?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, is there any mention of provenance or
history?
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, is there any mention of a breeding
process or seed making process?
[SPEAKER_00]: And four, are these people, even people
that I can identify?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is like outside of having
access to something like Breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a, that's something that
you can follow whether or not you have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to people like Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Matt, what about your opinion on
like, uh, trying to verify something
[SPEAKER_00]: you're thinking about buying or a company
that you are interested in or?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so hard for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so hard for me because I'm so
biased now, like, and I have to,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to think about this a lot because
when people ask me about someone,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to, if I don't like the
human, it's different than not liking or
[SPEAKER_02]: them not being decent at their job.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that makes sense, because there are
people that like, I don't get along with
[SPEAKER_02]: that are pretty good at fucking making
seeds and are legitimate and not liars.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just don't get along, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that parts, that part's been really
hard for me to divide because usually if I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't like someone, I don't support them
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think one thing that I can
probably guess is really important for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is just be able to have a conversation
with the person who at least seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the responsible person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like if you're not happy with seeds,
I imagine for you, the important thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk to the seed maker and see what
they have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk like you did with their flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want them to be smarter than me at this
and not to say they got to be genius.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm not genius at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm very basic at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people that, you know,
can speak circles around me all day when
[SPEAKER_02]: it comes to breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not even necessarily smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just be able to communicate basic,
basic shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I can, cause I'm basic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they communicate with me basically,
then it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I was taught, I told you yesterday,
um, I had a conversation with,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the RS 11 guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally could talk, speak on any level
about breeding, why he selected what he
[SPEAKER_02]: did, how many he did, what he was doing at
the time, you know, like all the things
[SPEAKER_02]: around it, the things that like,
when you actually put the time in and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it put in, you know, years to
breeding, like you start at least with me
[SPEAKER_02]: and a lot of my friends, we start
referring to things in our past by what we
[SPEAKER_02]: were growing at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's how we measure the time in our
lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's based on what our cycles of growing
work, because it's just the one constant
[SPEAKER_02]: in our lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you start hearing people talk
like that, then you know, it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: legitimately their, their being growing
their being.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it, it becomes their basis for time
in life, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of those things I look for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I noticed that yesterday and he's,
he, he's a totally different type of
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder in that he uses, you know,
more modern lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's doing modern work and, uh,
but we were still able to communicate on
[SPEAKER_02]: that level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought it was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's been a long time since I've met
a newer person that can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is part of your larger
point of actually just getting to know
[SPEAKER_00]: these people get to know the people you're
buying stuff from.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, this was, this conversation
wasn't even about like necessarily for the
[SPEAKER_02]: show at first, like it was, it was because
I, it all started out when I started
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing guava, the name guava pop up
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: During my era, guava usually meant
Stardog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was, it was Stardog Guava Cut was
in it and they called it Guava something,
[SPEAKER_02]: or it was like a mango smelling plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started going on some, a hunt,
trying to figure out what guava was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I kept seeing in everything,
including the RS11, the pink guava.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what kind of sent me on that
trail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to this day, like some people say it's
gelato something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people say it's Sherb something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no clue, but all I know is it's not
guava at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, I am interested to try the pink
guava now though, after hearing,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, Dio explain it, that sounds cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, yeah, after trying a bunch of
different strawberry guava, pineapple
[SPEAKER_02]: guava, none of them being pineapple,
strawberry or guava.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was kind of what even got me
thinking down the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: This process was why, why this meant
something else to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guava means something totally
different to a whole generation of
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does it mean this now?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what does it mean now?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where it kind of started,
you know, this little journey,
[SPEAKER_02]: this show, uh, initiating conversations
with like Clearwater genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was one of the people I went in,
actually went into his discord to do
[SPEAKER_02]: research on guava because I knew that our
discord probably wouldn't be a good place
[SPEAKER_02]: to do research on modern strains,
you know, like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not someone you can ask about modern
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know a lot of people in there
that are like, that's their thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I noticed Clearwater genetics had used
it in a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I figured I'd go in his discord and
ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah, he said gelato something,
very polite guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that was one step I took in
just trying to research.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one, one data point, one person using
the, the line's perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how experienced a breeding or
history or any of that he is at research,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's at least a data point that I can
take and say, okay, this breeder you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a said this reader B said this year,
C said this, this person has been around
[SPEAKER_02]: this long does this much research more
reliable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore this one is probably most likely
to answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I kind of break down my data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was how I went about it with
guava.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll add that like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, being able to have multiple,
uh, multiple perspectives on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that you can help to use verify that
one thing, whether it's like, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I mean, obviously there are limits
to that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I pointed out, you know, that example
of like social media influencers and these
[SPEAKER_00]: fake stores kind of, you know,
being in like the double cosine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The double cosine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do have to be careful of that
still, but I think having multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: perspectives where you can sort of discern
that they aren't the same agendas and
[SPEAKER_00]: operation across those perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, definitely tell you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily enough to confirm
everything, but it clearly, it definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's like, uh, like with the map,
when you triangulate points or,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, or like in, in a story, you know,
if you have two people that are unknown to
[SPEAKER_02]: each other, telling two very unique
statement or two very similar statements
[SPEAKER_02]: with very unique points, you know,
like that, that stands out and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, stands out quite a bit and
gives more, um, relevance to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because really, I mean, I've been scared
to use these terms, but we are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: addressing a much larger issue that,
you know, the world is still dealing with,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, uh, what they call like a
post-truth world, uh, where we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: face the uncertainty of information almost
now as a mundane, uh, issue, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a pervasive issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's sad though,
because I just don't, I don't know that
[SPEAKER_02]: this wasn't always the case, you know,
I just think it's become in people's
[SPEAKER_02]: faces, but yeah, I think it's always been
the case, even with our most popular,
[SPEAKER_02]: most famous book ever, you know,
it's just like, it's never been the case
[SPEAKER_02]: of where everything is as presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we can still point to reasons
why it's been accelerated though or
[SPEAKER_00]: galvanized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like obviously the internet, um,
being able to have like e-commerce,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like virtual shops, um,
social media, obviously specifically as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we mentioned the credit short,
uh, Reddit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you mean credit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a digital currency, the fact that you
don't have to have hard currency exchange
[SPEAKER_02]: hand to hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I had another big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I pointed out it being first of all,
a very complex, uh, process of production,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also a very complex process of like
judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those things compound like
to produce this, like very unstable
[SPEAKER_00]: information space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sorry, we were, we were kind of like
getting into a more prescriptive mode of
[SPEAKER_00]: like trying to give people suggestions on
how they actually verify information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the last thing we pointed out
was, like you said, multiple perspectives,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, different agendas, um, looking for
triangulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but what about something like
community met?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what do you think about,
so coming back to the breed is syndicate,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how important is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think to have a community of people
who are like, Oh, basically looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It again, it's like, I really truly feel,
and I'm sure any parent of any group that
[SPEAKER_02]: they build fills this way that it is such
an anomaly because it exists in a,
[SPEAKER_02]: in a vacuum of tons of forums that have
existed online since the beginning of
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada seeds being sold online.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have never seen a place that works
like ours ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's never been one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no, not even a close comparison by
any stretch of the imagination,
[SPEAKER_02]: almost every single forum typically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't remember any seed bank owners
that I ever liked or got along with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought, wow, these are really good
dudes that ran forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not one, not one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times it was very us or them
our way or the highway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if one of our breeders doesn't like
you, you're dead to us, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: type thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while those information spaces are
important, community is obviously
[SPEAKER_02]: important when you can do it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it can also be so just this bully
mentality of just stupidity and just in
[SPEAKER_02]: itself be its own Mark pool, like pool of
marks to scam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, yeah, it, it's scary because you
can put yourself in almost like a cult
[SPEAKER_02]: situation in some of these forums with the
way it turned out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just shift shoveling your money every time
someone does a drop because the forum
[SPEAKER_02]: owner says it's legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bam, bam, bam, bam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like double cosines going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was chatting with Shawnee about one of
these forums and, um, I, I had it popped
[SPEAKER_00]: into mind that these are almost like
little like feudal systems where you have
[SPEAKER_00]: like the Lord, you know, the forum owner,
the sponsors, and then kind of like the,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the peasants, the people who are like
forced almost forced to grow, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what they're being told to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and getting otherwise like banned if
you don't, you know, you don't comply.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's, it's tough too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause even, even with our discord,
there's always going to be a kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, attitude or theme, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That goes along with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ours is typically been like keeping
scammers out of our community.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that said, there are people that
maybe we know or to us, we have the
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge that are scammers, but other
people don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they come in thinking that these are
good people and come in promoting that
[SPEAKER_02]: scammers agenda and get pushed out real
fast from our group, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and to the, that person's perspective,
they may be looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're just as bad as all these other
forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause obviously we have an agenda.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not letting him push the agenda for
this particular person.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it, a lot of it is perspective too,
you know, like I just happened to know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I came in and a long time ago and happened
to know a lot of these people really
[SPEAKER_02]: intimately in person.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just business to business back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were so few of us that a lot of us
knew each other person to person.
[SPEAKER_02]: We dealt with each other at conventions,
Emerald cups, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of us were good friends over years
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of us were just acquaintances over
years time, but got to know each other
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty well, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's not just business to
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I comment on a lot of people and like
I was saying earlier, when you're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about like growing breeder stuff or,
and when I was talking about good person
[SPEAKER_02]: versus good genetics, for me, it's
sometimes it can be so hard because I'm so
[SPEAKER_02]: biased by being so in the middle of the
social scenario of breeding and seed
[SPEAKER_02]: making.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't help me for, for bias.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause, but I do as much as I can,
I try to be transparent and perspec and
[SPEAKER_02]: keep perspective on that for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I talk about a breeder and not liking
them, if it's someone that I like their,
[SPEAKER_02]: their actual gear, I'll point it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I try to be cognizant of
what I'm saying when I'm saying it,
[SPEAKER_02]: how I say it, because I know some people
take that to heart, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also add that, like, I think having a
strong community that you can largely
[SPEAKER_00]: trust embodies a lot of what embodies a
lot of the process already of what we were
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of recommending before, like in a
community you have the opportunity to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: get multiple perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to have extended conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why I say extended, like, as a key
part of this is that over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're talking to the same people,
you start to discern patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start to be able to know whether what
they say is consistent, reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have having these sustained
interactions with multiple people who all
[SPEAKER_00]: have different agendas and different you
know, growing situations and contexts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much easier to come to, you know,
more reliable truths, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we don't want to say that like,
you can either you get perfect information
[SPEAKER_00]: or you get false information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always going to be somewhere in
between, you know, like truth,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately, no longer is an absolute
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like true or false.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like we now have degrees of
truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and degrees of strength of truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if there's a piece of information
that, again, is verified by multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: people, and again, you know, they don't
have a shared agenda, we can probably say
[SPEAKER_00]: that that is a more reliable truth than
one that is maybe spoken by one person who
[SPEAKER_00]: has an obvious agenda, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is an obvious example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a community, again, helps you
definitely kind of like speeds up any of
[SPEAKER_00]: these processes of verifying information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like thinking about it,
like, when you brought up community,
[SPEAKER_02]: my first instinct is to like, push back
from that, because it'd be very easy to be
[SPEAKER_02]: like, yeah, no, our discourse the way,
you know, it would be very easy to do
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, I'm also very big
about like, in communities that can't be
[SPEAKER_02]: pedestals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's something else people
really need to take into account,
[SPEAKER_02]: even in our own discourse, like,
I try to make try to be very human there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people know I'm just a fuck up like
everyone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always fuck up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's an important part of the
community, too, is that it's a community,
[SPEAKER_02]: not a oligarchy or something weird,
you know, like a dictatorship.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very important to know and know the
difference between that and know what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're in the middle of and always keep
keep a very good perspective around you
[SPEAKER_02]: with who you're surrounding yourself with,
more importantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to point out and I think this
could almost be his own episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I kind of wanted to point out what I
think are symptoms of a not very good
[SPEAKER_00]: community, i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: like a lot of the discourse that I have
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Brita's Syndicate, again,
what I was trying to draw your attention
[SPEAKER_00]: to was having sustained extended
conversations with the same people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what you find in most other discourse
is that there is communication,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's often really fragmented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you don't really have the same people
participating all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have kind of random one off
interactions with random people and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's just no continuity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think so if you get validation in
that kind of context, I'd be much less
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to trust the information there
because you just don't have again,
[SPEAKER_00]: a the duration of interactions,
the kind of like extended repeated
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore you can't it's very hard to
verify what you're hearing from them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've just been recently learning
about the discourse that exists as clone
[SPEAKER_02]: gathering stations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you heard about these places like
that cell phone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm new to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was very new to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the guys that's a moderator in
a few of these and I were having a
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation, really smart, nice dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He seems like he's like he's genuinely
interested in collecting clones for the
[SPEAKER_02]: purpose of getting data points to
experience them, learn them, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great reason to get into
collecting clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally admire that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I got into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what a lot of people do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I cannot shit on that at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't shit on clone collecting
whatsoever, even though I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily do anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like these clone collecting places,
what I'm learning is that the people in
[SPEAKER_02]: these don't understand that the people
holding these old clones don't interact
[SPEAKER_02]: with groups that sell their old clones,
because that's not how it was ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were things that were gifted and
shared and gifted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when someone takes a gift or something
that you're sharing with them,
[SPEAKER_02]: like that's in your circle and like a
familial type thing and sell it,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're usually it's made out like they're
cut off from the group.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how things go over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not a hoarding thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a completely different mentality
on how groups are built, how
[SPEAKER_02]: apprenticeship like how apprenticeship
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Friendships are built, how trust is built
over time, because a lot of times if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're if you're learning someone,
you share a clone with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't ever you on that clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: They never pass it out or any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that, you know, you can trust
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a little more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how trust and love and
friendships are built over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what a lot of these people are
missing in these cut organizations and
[SPEAKER_02]: don't get that the people that actually
own the cuts with the provenance and the
[SPEAKER_02]: good provenance that they want aren't
going to be interacting with the groups
[SPEAKER_02]: who let these cuts out in the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when they're spending these several
hundred dollars, thousands and sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: on these clones that they're hoping are
real and aren't and they're wondering why
[SPEAKER_02]: this happens, it's because they're
completely missing the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, clone trading is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I just gave clones to people because I
didn't really give a shit about that in
[SPEAKER_02]: the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I just didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave away all of my clones and realized
that like I can pop seeds and find
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever I got out of that mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's some of it is because I
have those data points now and they're in
[SPEAKER_02]: my brain and they'll be there forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody, I think if you're going to
take reading seriously needs some of those
[SPEAKER_02]: data points, but know how to get to that
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're in one of those groups and
you're seeing that go down, kind of have
[SPEAKER_02]: some some spidey senses go off a little
bit of when it comes to the provenance
[SPEAKER_02]: part, because these guys don't have access
to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have access to a lot of what
they're claiming to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they do have some of these clones,
they probably got it in shady ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to lead to bad provenance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to get stuck in a wall
where like you're going to be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, how can I prove that this is what
you're telling me and that I paid all this
[SPEAKER_02]: money for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, it looks like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best we can do, you know, so keep all
that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did also want to speak to a bit of a
like, I don't know if paradox is the right
[SPEAKER_00]: word with clones, but I know that one of
the one of the messages that you had for
[SPEAKER_00]: this season was about trying to escape
this like clone fetishization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the clone fetishization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and so on the one hand, it's like,
yeah, you know, God is dead kind of vibe,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and we're all like past that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also like clones are dead,
but also long live clones, because given
[SPEAKER_00]: how poor the information game is,
sometimes if you have a verified clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is one of the few reliable data points
that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's an index.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like what you were saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're a bit of a gift curse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know this is its own topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you know, clones versus seeds and all
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure we'll get to that probably in
another episode now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are still extremely important,
but they are also the cause of a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really, I mean, because at the end
of the day, clones are just one or two
[SPEAKER_02]: groups selection that they feel represents
what they were going for best or that they
[SPEAKER_02]: think the market will like best.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, that's you
know, like who is doing the selecting?
[SPEAKER_02]: How, how researched are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: How, how well versed are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: How experienced are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they, are they, do they smoke weed
even?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's again, do they smoke fucking weed
even?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these guys don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are they doing their selecting?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do they have experience smoking
weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these guys never even have.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have no interest in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just another commodity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, no, clones are very hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard because there are good data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Data points to be gotten from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I recommend people run
cheese and stuff like that so that they
[SPEAKER_02]: have that data point for skunk one or sour
chem 91, Chem D.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's worth saying, obviously,
and this is going to be obvious thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, but the same, the same problems that
affect your ability to discern
[SPEAKER_00]: authenticity in flower and seeds obviously
affects clone sales as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are, you know, like the one
great thing about cannabis being a very
[SPEAKER_02]: modern, like our scene being very modern
is that a lot of these guys that did the
[SPEAKER_02]: selections, some of those guys still have
those cuts in their hand, never lost them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like, like with art,
if you were going to an artist for a
[SPEAKER_02]: painting, you'd want to go to the first,
the person who did it, the most reliable
[SPEAKER_02]: person go to the source.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I mean, cannabis is young enough
to where a lot of clones can still be
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I actually think, well, okay,
actually this is, I think this is an
[SPEAKER_00]: important anecdote from my personal
journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think early on I had given up all,
I think I'd given up on the, on the
[SPEAKER_00]: possibility of actually talking to someone
who was, who had any relationship to these
[SPEAKER_00]: clones at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ba I basically just thought it wasn't
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everything that I saw on the
internet, I was just like, nothing feels
[SPEAKER_00]: like I can actually connect to the real
people behind all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually felt, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it didn't also take that long to find
some people like Brita Sinha and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, wow, they are real people behind some
of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, eventually you can find them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, I think what the craziest part
about all the whole clone collecting scene
[SPEAKER_02]: is, is if you really break it down,
like you get really good at figuring out
[SPEAKER_02]: who, who has done the best research,
who is the most fastidious about
[SPEAKER_02]: provenance, about keeping their plants
healthy, how long they've been kept alive,
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping tags, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like four, maybe people that have
this large collection of all these clones
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout our community that are keeping
them, that are reliable for all of their
[SPEAKER_02]: clones because they were just consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like four, four people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's out of our whole world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four that I can count and in all of my
research and I'm not one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So four.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's, that's, that's scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be scary and very,
and people are going to say that that's
[SPEAKER_02]: not realistic, but it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a thousand percent true.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's four people and we're
lucky to have them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy to think about.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the breeders, all the seed makers out
there, tens of thousands.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's four, four people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to zoom out a bit and just think
about like, I think like Matt mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we probably mentioned that multiple
times, like one of the pivots that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: making this season is to help encourage
people to, to think about what they are
[SPEAKER_00]: buying and whether or not what they are
buying is legit and how they can know
[SPEAKER_00]: whether something that they're buying is
legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other major thing is this
whole tension with clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think obviously we touched on the
former that that's this whole episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think we'll probably come back to
like seeds versus clones, like another
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, yeah, I think that could be a
full episode in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge thing in and of itself because
like that for that latter topic,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a lot of people who don't like
this show, uh, what they like to say is
[SPEAKER_00]: you're kind of just ruining our fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like does history actually matter that
much when I can still find good shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of a fair point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's sort of a fair criticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we probably need to evaluate what
the trade-offs actually are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're obviously going to be
trade-offs with people who are very
[SPEAKER_00]: fastidious about provenance and they're
going to be trade-offs with people who
[SPEAKER_00]: don't care at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just looking for quote unquote fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think both lines of thinking are
actually sort of legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we could cover that in another
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And think about what the pros and cons
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, man, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've said quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is quite a dense episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also feel like I have repeated
myself a lot, but now just to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that like, we really, really drilled these
points home because I think what Matt and
[SPEAKER_00]: I also discovering is that so many people
somehow still don't know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It never ceases to amaze me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It never ceases to amaze me a few things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one at how many of the scammers that
continue to scam over the years,
[SPEAKER_02]: that always blows my mind because it's the
same people, but they had it figured out
[SPEAKER_02]: early on that like there's a cycle of new
growers always coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as long as they could nail those new
people, they have a constant influx of new
[SPEAKER_02]: customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the main things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that always blew my mind
was constantly having to explain to people
[SPEAKER_02]: that there are bulk seed makers and they
supply most of the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: That part, that part I always think is
going to like be someday be like common
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge because it's like that in a lot
of industries, but for some reason in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, it's just like not known still,
no matter how many times it's said or
[SPEAKER_02]: reiterated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we did a whole show on it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the worst kept secret of our
business, you know, but yeah, it's still
[SPEAKER_02]: not that well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like with the watch analogy,
if you broaden like this inquiry towards
[SPEAKER_00]: like various forms of commerce online,
you will see the same patterns playing
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that cannabis, like for reasons
I've mentioned multiple times,
[SPEAKER_00]: just is like even more susceptible to
these scams and like exploitations than
[SPEAKER_00]: other products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gray market means that there's no like
real legal recompense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to draw in a lot of people
whose only intention is to scam because
[SPEAKER_02]: they know that they can legally get away
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most people like, especially like
white collar criminals, that's what they
[SPEAKER_02]: live for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're, that's their scam.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the, and being in a gray market just
kind of opens it up to people like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't that we're too scared to grow,
but they can kind of fuck around in this
[SPEAKER_02]: realm.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll get in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I think that's why it does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me just black hat for a moment and
just, and just explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'll unpack this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to start your own brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so easy to set up something on
Shopify, go steal a bunch of pictures from
[SPEAKER_00]: someone else, go steal a bunch of writing
from someone else or use chat GPT to
[SPEAKER_00]: invent some story for your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, go buy some bulk seeds that are really
cheap from some random place, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: set up an Instagram account and you're,
you're, you're Gucci.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do this like a day or two, easy,
you know, easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're smart, like you can
definitely trick people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously I'm not saying this to
encourage you to do it, but just showing
[SPEAKER_00]: you how easy it actually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing that sucks though,
is that I'm not going anywhere and
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody got to get it past me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that sucks because it doesn't happen
very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we obviously outlined some of the
steps that we think you could take,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, in your own, you know, in your own,
uh, searches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, I'd also be interested to
hear, like if other people have other
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas for how you, you know, how you can
best to verify any piece of information,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, within cannabis, um,
I'd love to hear more suggestions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd also like to hear from more from the
people that really hate what I have to
[SPEAKER_02]: say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if you think that my advice was kind
of shitty, like what were the steps you
[SPEAKER_02]: use to do it better?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, cause maybe people are
doing it better than my advice and maybe I
[SPEAKER_02]: could be getting better advice on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So leave the comments below.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ultimately, you know, it's a very
complex, again, subjective thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Judgment is subjective, you know,
like evaluating these things is really
[SPEAKER_00]: subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we want to just like generate
more of this conversation and provoke more
[SPEAKER_00]: of this thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because that's, that's what's
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily about like making
specific points.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about ensuring that everyone is on
this well, more people are on this journey
[SPEAKER_00]: of actually trying to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I just totally hit that on accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I'm going to ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And otherwise I think that's more or less
what I have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise I'm just going to keep repeating
myself over and over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same, like, you know, there are
avenues to be able to do the research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I highly suggest like, don't even just use
breeder syndicate, like go pick up
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana botany, go pick cannabis,
ethnobotany and evolution from,
[SPEAKER_02]: from Merlin and Clark, learn that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that will give you everything you need
to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really truly understand those
books, that will give you everything you
[SPEAKER_02]: need to know to start breaking down at
least, uh, breeder speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: When people like, you know, for instance,
this person that I wrote earlier that
[SPEAKER_02]: said, Oh, well, you know, there are
phenotypes that you can, you can counter
[SPEAKER_02]: that real fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll know what, what is bullshit
with it and what is not highly
[SPEAKER_02]: recommended.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also like the more diverse your
sources of information, um, the better an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea you'll get of what is consistent
across those different sources of
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like going back to what Matt was
saying about triangulate, like
[SPEAKER_00]: triangulating something, you know,
if you read a whole bunch of texts,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see some of the same concepts recur.
[SPEAKER_00]: That probably makes it a higher likelihood
that that is reliable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and the one other thing I'll add is
phylos is not reliable data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I should have said that somewhere in
the beginning, because people are still
[SPEAKER_02]: using that as reliable data.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine because we're going to have an
episode on the codex where all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: will be brought into question again,
into context.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it is something that people use as
data points.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just remember like most people,
again, don't know the whole story behind
[SPEAKER_02]: that and how it all broke down and why
they closed up genetic shock, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_02]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the codex episode, um, we can talk
about leafly, strainly, phylos,
[SPEAKER_00]: seed finder.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go over all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be time to cover that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, anything else you want to get in?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to, yeah, I don't want to
repeat myself again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you weren't reviewing something for
this one, were you?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no reviews this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, no, it was just the,
the Louie thing I wanted to cover
[SPEAKER_02]: basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, you know,
we have, uh, we had our, our new high and
[SPEAKER_02]: lonesome drop over our right seeds.com
with the Appalachia, the green crack BX.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we had a chem doc DBX and some of
those are going to be restocked soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, pack have some new, uh, feminized
Santa Cruz blue dream, legitimate blue
[SPEAKER_02]: dream crosses coming out soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some of those are popping up on our
Patreon 50 tier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, as far as like, uh, testers going out
there and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was all kinds of fun stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Pico is getting a bunch of bad-ass new
modern Fenn stuff in the Patreon packs as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks to Pico, uh, pandas helped out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's helping out with the Patreon
packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's, it's getting real exciting over
there in the 50 tier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just keep your eyes posted for the
reviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be doing more of the legit or
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just regular, um, regular flower
reviews on modern strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can actually break down and tell you
what some of the stuff that you've seen
[SPEAKER_02]: and heard about, like, from someone who's
smoked weed for a long time and has a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of experience with a lot of different
strains, how I sense these strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: what I get from it, the high, the scent,
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that helps someone out
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we actually got a new idea for
legit or nah, as well as in like another
[SPEAKER_00]: form of that same series could also be you
reviewing seed banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if it's like, whether you're
going by like today, we're going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: Barney's farm or the alternative being
like, Let's look at all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: chems, quote unquote, that are being sold
across these different seed bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are lots of cool
possibilities for us for those episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you hear that, you like that idea,
leave a comment below and let us know you
[SPEAKER_02]: like that idea too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if I see a bunch of you like that,
I'll get on it and see what we can figure
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think it'd be very enlightening
for some people, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rightseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go buy our spray, Feminize Spray,
