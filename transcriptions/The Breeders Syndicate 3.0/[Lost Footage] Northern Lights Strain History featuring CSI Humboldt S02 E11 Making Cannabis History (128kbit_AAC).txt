[SPEAKER_03]: Hello bastards and bastardettes,
how we doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Settled in here for the Yeah thingy today
the fucking thingy so As you saw I think
[SPEAKER_03]: we're gonna have CSI humble come stop by
Whenever you may not show up at the very
[SPEAKER_03]: beginning, but he'll be here at some point
and we will go over what he saw in the NL
[SPEAKER_03]: reproduction And let me get not so in here
Or do I have to do them both same time?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see So we'll keep our eyes peeled
for when CSI pops up You guys let me know
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasabi I need to teach you how to use a
camera Before you mean teach camera as my
[SPEAKER_03]: own heads cut off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Headspace that you need to get There
you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a professor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just analyzing my shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just super anal dude I like logged
in and like your shit was like aiming at
[SPEAKER_03]: the wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I started I start off with a
scenery of my my ceiling You do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, cuz nobody wants to see my fucking
face the first time they jump in I want to
[SPEAKER_03]: traumatize anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be I want it to be smooth Yeah,
all right So I'm Trying to think of how to
[SPEAKER_04]: start this uh Well, I don't know what you
said because I just popped I haven't said
[SPEAKER_04]: anything we're hoping Managing technical
difficulties and whatnot that we might be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to get a CSI on to chat about some
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah and this This Friday evening we kind
of decided that we were going to maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of merge Something that's current
Going on right now with some historical
[SPEAKER_04]: shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right and we had an excellent
opportunity to do that in the in the nl5
[SPEAKER_04]: project that Matt and and CSI have been up
to an nl5 Probably needs no introduction
[SPEAKER_04]: in the sense that it's probably like one
of the most famous terms in all of
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada's Yeah, but there's a lot of legend
behind it and there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: misinformation behind it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we thought for this episode Maybe
we could sort of like take you guys
[SPEAKER_04]: through Like how it started some of the
history to it and a lot of this stuff has
[SPEAKER_04]: been chatted about in various ways and
shapes and forms But we thought it might
[SPEAKER_04]: be interesting to sort of like coalesce it
all into one show Yeah, and start from
[SPEAKER_04]: back then and sort of bring it into the
now Bring it into the modern times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because you know, so I mean I've
done I've helped with some like 90s stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: and It makes me feel old.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, the 90s is like 30 plus
years ago now And the 80s when all this
[SPEAKER_04]: shit was happening was 40 plus years ago
now so most people in cannabis have heard
[SPEAKER_04]: about nl5 but it's mostly just legends and
there's a lot of misinformation and a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of funny cuts and a lot of odd stories and
so we kind of thought we just Chat about
[SPEAKER_04]: those kind of aspects a little bit and
sort of merge the history with a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit of the project that these guys are
doing Because they tie in together They
[SPEAKER_04]: throw that Yeah, I mean, where do we want
to start?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we can start with Maybe I'll
start maybe we can start with just the
[SPEAKER_04]: generalization, you know, and then we'll
start with some history So the reason why
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody knows what nl5 is In my opinion
is because of never right Neville
[SPEAKER_04]: Popularized it he picked a selection and
he used the nl5 and a bunch of famous
[SPEAKER_04]: crosses One of which was probably the most
famous line of all time that nl5 hates
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and then other groups and Canadian
seed banks and all these different things
[SPEAKER_04]: started using the name nl5 nl5,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah And it just sort of became part of
the fabric of cannabis history.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if you will Right, and there was a
lot misunderstood about it or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's probably one of the most
recognizable terms in cannabis Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think even people like my parents,
you know, my mom my dad was who he was
[SPEAKER_03]: with weed But my mom had nothing to do
with it She wanted nothing to do with it
[SPEAKER_03]: never learned it and even she has sort of
northern lights as a straight and northern
[SPEAKER_04]: lights and northern lights five and all
that and so now What we've got going on is
[SPEAKER_04]: is I've joked on previous episodes or
whatever that like when I was trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: collect A lot of old stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was almost impossible but now we're
kind of in this wave of You know famous
[SPEAKER_04]: things from the 80s and 90s, you know Or
in any form they might exist in has has
[SPEAKER_04]: got a resurgence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah of popularity and interest and People
want to see what's up with you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: what was once common becomes legendary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Right is really is kind of what it
boils down to and so For anyone that came
[SPEAKER_04]: into the weed scene later when nl5 was
already kind of a myth You know You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: hopefully we can like clear up a bunch of
stuff because there's a lot of There's a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of people that are talking about the
name Yeah Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what?
[SPEAKER_03]: When we tell this tale, let's go ahead and
start with there was a man named Herman
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure and her be Went to a certain hair
hair salon where the northern light crew
[SPEAKER_03]: hung out and he would go to they would go
to this hair salon and Commune and smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: weed and talk stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this guy named Herbie came in and he
was a veteran and he Wanted to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow and Make a living for himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they set him up with some light Since
some of the original Steve Murphy Afghani
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds and he had some of his own Different
hybrids he was working with mostly
[SPEAKER_03]: Colombian and Mexican.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that was the quote Yeah,
and and he he was the one who selected
[SPEAKER_03]: this nl5 clone from Errs from his own work
with the Steve Murphy Afghan and Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I mean probably the the way That
people can understand at the best is that
[SPEAKER_04]: there was a loose collective group of
friends You know, you know acquaintances
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever in the Pacific Northwest area
Yeah, Herbie was one.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a guy named some some people
call him the Indian was another one Steve
[SPEAKER_04]: Murphy was a different one there was you
know a There was a number of different
[SPEAKER_04]: characters all involved at various points.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it was a mostly Everyone has to
remember that in that time in the early
[SPEAKER_04]: 80s almost everything in America was still
sativa and blends of different sativas
[SPEAKER_04]: because all the all the weed that came
into America Was seeded sativa weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the core of everybody starting to
breathe was you got three seeds with your
[SPEAKER_04]: sativa weed lots Lots of them and the rare
shit was indica because indica made hash
[SPEAKER_04]: hash didn't come With three seeds and so
indica seeds were really hard to acquire
[SPEAKER_04]: They came from people on the hippie
hashish trail people like Sam skunk man
[SPEAKER_04]: and Neville and others made trips to
Afghanistan which in that era was
[SPEAKER_04]: extremely difficult to do It's dangerous
and they started bringing back small
[SPEAKER_04]: amounts of seeds So unlike sativa that was
getting sativa seeds spread out all over
[SPEAKER_04]: America in every kilo that was sold Indica
seeds were hard to come by yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: so the NL story starts with a very small
handful of seeds of Pure indica that came
[SPEAKER_04]: from this dude named Steve Murphy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Right, and then of course just like
anybody The group in on the Pacific
[SPEAKER_04]: Northwest up there started making hybrids
of this stuff They crossed it to itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: They crossed it to everything else they
had and the the famous numbers of NL
[SPEAKER_04]: basically You know Connotate like the
lower the number the more indica and the
[SPEAKER_04]: shorter it was Yeah, so the one two three
four were prep, you know predominantly
[SPEAKER_04]: indica based and Smaller and you start
getting into five six seven eight nine ten
[SPEAKER_04]: eleven and they start getting more and
more sativa now Matt's already interviewed
[SPEAKER_04]: one of the main characters in the in this
thing and he basically stated that they
[SPEAKER_04]: took that Steve Murphy Afghan and they
crossed it to every sativa they could Get
[SPEAKER_04]: their hands on so Hawaiians Mexicans
Colombians Thai Indians you said Indians
[SPEAKER_04]: blends of those things hybrids of those
things all back and forth, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah the NL five they had this buddy named
Herbie who got involved and Herbie had a
[SPEAKER_04]: Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and this Hawaiian was You know he
crossed he it got crossed to the Steve
[SPEAKER_04]: Murphy Afghan and The it got called nl5
for its position in the height and the
[SPEAKER_04]: blend of sativa versus indica or whatever
and they found a pheno that they really
[SPEAKER_04]: really liked so nl5 initially was a seed
line created within that little crew and
[SPEAKER_04]: Then Herbie gave back to the nl crew like
this select pheno that he was super
[SPEAKER_04]: excited about and so the as best we can
tell it It's a pure Afghan from Steve
[SPEAKER_04]: Murphy on the one side and a Mexican
Colombian we believe on the other side
[SPEAKER_04]: That was called a Hawaiian because it was
called a Hawaiian because it was grown in
[SPEAKER_04]: Hawaii But there is no indigenous Hawaiian
weed Yeah, most Hawaiian weed was Mexican
[SPEAKER_04]: Colombian a blend of those two or a blend
of those two with Afghan, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: so You know and then as you know as the
story's been told this gentleman sent
[SPEAKER_04]: Neville A whole bunch of seeds all
numbered Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I don't know if you have any of
those catalogs handy but Neville's story
[SPEAKER_04]: is that Neville's story is that he was you
know, he did a lot of work with them and a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of them as We found out were a mess
because they were a blend of Indica's and
[SPEAKER_04]: and sativas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but in this one seed of nl5 Out of a
bunch of Indica sativa hybrids and a mess.
[SPEAKER_04]: He found this plant That was what he
called the pure Indica throwback that
[SPEAKER_04]: showed zero Sativa influence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was short.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was squat.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was leafy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was covered in frost.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't have a lot of smell and so he
started crossing this to things and it
[SPEAKER_04]: crossed amazingly well With basically
everything he threw on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so The legend of nl5 was born
because he crossed it to skunk one and He
[SPEAKER_04]: crossed it to nl.
[SPEAKER_04]: He crossed it to haze and He crossed it to
nl2 and he crossed it to a few other
[SPEAKER_04]: things It started showing up in poly
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: He made like silver pearl Yeah,
and it just sort of became one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: building blocks of his genetic library And
since he was one of the first dudes that
[SPEAKER_04]: had a seed bank Anything that he had that
he threw into a bunch of crosses kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: went everywhere Yeah, right and all these
things are winning high times You know
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff and it's getting big glossy pictures
and nl5 haze was the most popular strain
[SPEAKER_04]: they sold So the legend of it just took
off Now there's a debate here because what
[SPEAKER_04]: what's indisputable is that he went to the
states and he got the Pacific Northwest
[SPEAKER_04]: hash plant and the and the g13 through
friends of Another guy who's pretty famous
[SPEAKER_04]: named Jorge Cervantes some friends of his
hooked him up and he arranged for the
[SPEAKER_04]: cutting That the guys in the Pacific
Northwest were growing as nl5 to be
[SPEAKER_04]: shipped over Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and so they did this they did this
clever thing where they shipped this plant
[SPEAKER_04]: over in a terrarium of other plants and
they took scissors and they Cut the
[SPEAKER_04]: serrations off the edges of each of the
pot leaves So it didn't look like wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sick, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: They just shaved all that off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looked unusual and If Neville is
posted back when he used to post on mr
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice That he didn't like that one as much
because it wasn't as consistent of a
[SPEAKER_04]: breeder as the one he found amongst the
seed line Yeah, and so he didn't use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so right there you have this massive
confusion where Everybody thinks nl5 is
[SPEAKER_04]: the same thing Where it is kind of the
same thing, but there's a seed line that
[SPEAKER_04]: never got out There's a clone that they
selected from that seed line that was
[SPEAKER_04]: popular in Washington yeah, and there's a
clone that that Neville found amongst
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds they sent to him and They all got
called nl5.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and that's where a lot of the
conclusion lies Yeah, so people think
[SPEAKER_04]: they'll be like, oh I've got the same
Clone that Neville used and all of his
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding, but it never left the West
Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Well, no because Neville says he
found it in seat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah You know, so there was there was two
select cuttings even early and you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: most people don't realize this but Neville
says his was like a total Afghan throwback
[SPEAKER_04]: and The one that that the Seattle crew
describes had like two-foot colas on it,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right long running wine green
colas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well Yes, and no yes and no if I remember
if I remember it was stated that they
[SPEAKER_03]: combined Different buds to make it look
like it had a massive cola for net full in
[SPEAKER_04]: the Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so that was there was some Fun stuff
going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some shenanigans perhaps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes shenanigans abound There was some
shenanigans.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a so yeah, I mean there's an
aspect where I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking down for a second because Matt
didn't have his catalog handy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I always do too, but I do I don't
know if there's a bigger version of this
[SPEAKER_04]: but if everyone wants to look That picture
right there that is a picture of the
[SPEAKER_04]: mother cut Taken in Amsterdam and put in
the sensei seeds catalog Taken when it won
[SPEAKER_04]: a cup in 1995.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was printed in the 96 catalog that Is
that is one of the few existing pictures
[SPEAKER_04]: of an actual growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: NL five that Neville used and you can see
it's short.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's squat.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's leafy as fuck You know, it's got all
these things going on to it And so,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know So nl5 Neville said that nl5 was
probably nl5 Hayes was probably the most
[SPEAKER_04]: famous and best-selling Thing in his whole
catalog both at his seed bank and later at
[SPEAKER_04]: sensei.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah The nl5 skunk one got renamed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's I don't know if it was renamed Shiva
Shiva skunk Yeah, I think it was renamed
[SPEAKER_04]: Shiva skunk at sensei seeds, but it was
sold the whole time Yeah, so probably it
[SPEAKER_04]: was sold from 87 or 88 all the way through
You know 1999 or the early 2000s still
[SPEAKER_04]: probably to this day, but it's not the
same shit Yeah, and nl5 Hayes was sold
[SPEAKER_04]: consistently So, you know, it just kind of
entered into the lexicon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody knows nl5 Hayes Yeah,
and it's gotten old enough now that a
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch of people are like, oh I have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the original cutting I have the
this I have the that so you know You know
[SPEAKER_04]: and and and you know it it Someone's
saying nothing about the nl crew telling
[SPEAKER_04]: Neville that I mean Neville, you know
Neville spoke about the nl but he
[SPEAKER_04]: basically like Has said that he just got
He just got these labeled seeds and he
[SPEAKER_04]: made his own inferences about them You
know, so yeah You know, he had he had to
[SPEAKER_04]: make it up basically like he had to think
what am I seeing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and then you know the guys back then
it was in the 80s and they were all scared
[SPEAKER_04]: of getting Busted so they didn't really
take copious notes No, and then yeah that
[SPEAKER_04]: was stated several times, you know And we
actually know a bit more about the nl5
[SPEAKER_04]: than we know about a lot of the other nl
numbers Because of what herbie was working
[SPEAKER_04]: with and what he said he crossed to the
Steve Murphy to get that nl5 Yeah So it's
[SPEAKER_04]: like a lot of things, you know,
I mean a lot of a lot of a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: greetings are collaborative It's a small
group of friends doing one part at my
[SPEAKER_04]: garage and you do the next part of yours
and this and that and everything else and
[SPEAKER_04]: who's Responsible for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There might be one or two people that gets
known for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in reality, there's a whole Little
group that's involved Yeah, it was it was
[SPEAKER_04]: a kind of small group.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep So, you know and then you know when it
comes to nl5 haze Neville claims that
[SPEAKER_04]: right before he left sensi about 95 ish.
[SPEAKER_04]: They lost the mother of nl5 don't it died
and it makes kind of sense because if you
[SPEAKER_04]: like there's a bunch of nl5 haze cuts that
still are kept in In America, especially
[SPEAKER_04]: in the New York region and in Amsterdam
and they all are basically from 88 to 95
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah You know, there's not really people
aren't really like oh, I got this one in
[SPEAKER_04]: 2002 But there was a lot of fire in those
seven or eight years that they were able
[SPEAKER_04]: to marry those two plants together Yeah,
you know and then you know Super silver
[SPEAKER_04]: haze and stuff like that was kind of
Neville's attempt to blend the three most
[SPEAKER_04]: famous Amsterdam lines together which was
nl skunk and haze and so, you know now we
[SPEAKER_04]: have this whole thing where everything
gets different names and different
[SPEAKER_04]: nicknames and Tons of shit has nl or skunk
or haze blended into it Yeah, but you
[SPEAKER_04]: might not know because it doesn't have
that name attached Yeah, you know No,
[SPEAKER_04]: someone said I assumed it was phenos of
one to nine.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was different hybrids So nl1 was
almost pure afghan nl2 was another afghan
[SPEAKER_04]: that they actually got like a kush type
afghan from the Indian and They blended
[SPEAKER_04]: that to Steve Murphy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, three and four sort of lost a time
Nobody has them but they were also,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know They started increasing amounts
of sativa and five through eleven were
[SPEAKER_04]: just the nl crews crossing that afghan to
different sativas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah and You know the more the higher the
number the taller the plant the more
[SPEAKER_04]: sativa influenced.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how we know it So if you look
around At some of Neville's early
[SPEAKER_04]: catalogs, you can see him playing around
He uses the eight he uses the five he uses
[SPEAKER_04]: the nine He's got the one and the two,
you know all these different things and
[SPEAKER_04]: then after three or four years He decided
basically that he was only gonna breed
[SPEAKER_04]: with the one the two And the one cutting
of the five that he found.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and so all these other hybrids kind
of go away because probably because they
[SPEAKER_04]: were mixes of Extreme sativas with
Indica's and they were probably a lot more
[SPEAKER_03]: of a pain in the ass for a breeder to tame
yeah, and he did have high high as far as
[SPEAKER_03]: his keepers he did use a Rigorous
selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he didn't keep he went through a lot of
seeds And the Indian I believe the Indian
[SPEAKER_04]: was Native American But I can't say that
for somebody was he was Native American,
[SPEAKER_04]: but he was he was part of the Pacific
Northwest crew Yeah And a lot of these
[SPEAKER_04]: guys aren't aren't well known and don't
want to be the well-known because in the
[SPEAKER_04]: 80s especially in the late 80s There was a
series of rolling busts and they all got
[SPEAKER_04]: in trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it was a hard time to be a
cultivator You know Getting a green
[SPEAKER_03]: merchant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah and all that it was there was a lot
of persecution back then there was a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of secrecy back then that's part of why
they Didn't keep copious notes because
[SPEAKER_04]: they didn't want them to be used against
them in a court of law later on and so You
[SPEAKER_04]: know, but basically I say I think it's
fair to say that the reason why everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: knows nl5 is because of Neville that I
think that's fair I think everybody agrees
[SPEAKER_04]: with that too because he and even like the
Seattle guys will say that if they hadn't
[SPEAKER_04]: sent it to Neville It likely would have
been lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because they went through a rolling
series of busts and had issues Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, so it so it was sold at Neville
seed bank for a number of years and Then
[SPEAKER_04]: it was sold at Sensei for a number of
years after that never pure Right always a
[SPEAKER_04]: hybrid scum one Hayes nl2 Silver pearl
other poly hybrids blended together,
[SPEAKER_04]: but never really by itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah So there was a pure seed line of nl5
But nobody got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't make it to out of Amsterdam It
was given to like a couple people and even
[SPEAKER_04]: like even great, you know Even like some
of the Seattle guys said that there was a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of cuts that got out The eight the
nine and maybe one of and maybe one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: twos from the Indian but nothing else
Yeah, so the five survived because it went
[SPEAKER_04]: to Amsterdam Basically, yeah It's that's
the only reason it survived.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only reason why it survived So
if you listen to the Seattle crew,
[SPEAKER_04]: they had one version of nl5 that they kept
as a cutting and kind of cropped out
[SPEAKER_04]: Neville found a breeder that he kept,
you know, yeah, and You know, it kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: it kind of went into it kind of went into
legend you know, and so You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so yeah, I see all kinds of people
what's up with this person's nl1.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up with this nl5?
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened is is because it became so
famous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, two things happened One is that in
Amsterdam anytime anything gets famous
[SPEAKER_04]: people get seeds of it and they white
label it Yeah, right and they offer up
[SPEAKER_04]: their own versions of it Okay,
and then on top of that when the Canadian
[SPEAKER_04]: seed companies got involved They ended up
buying a bunch of stuff from Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_04]: blending it to Canadian strains and
claiming that they had these things for
[SPEAKER_04]: sales purposes Yeah, you know so you get
and and they all have sort of dodgy
[SPEAKER_04]: history Yeah, when it comes to provenance
what I've what I've told you so far is
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty much factually agreed to By the
people that sent it to Neville and
[SPEAKER_04]: Neville.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah and people around Neville Yeah,
you know and then it gets famous and
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a proliferation of people and seed
banks that claim to have various stuff But
[SPEAKER_04]: they weren't passing out this cutting to
other people No, they weren't sharing it
[SPEAKER_04]: just so other people in different
continents could like make their own seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: with it It wasn't like today where people
were trading seeds back and forth No,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know and yeah clones back and forth,
especially to competitors, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the Dutch are extremely business oriented
Very they're not going to just like bro
[SPEAKER_04]: out Yeah, that's why Matt's laughing
because they very are very much business
[SPEAKER_04]: oriented if they have a cut and everyone
else wants it and They're breeding off it
[SPEAKER_04]: and making money.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not really a chance They're gonna
share that fucking thing and there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: definite chance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's gonna say that they have it
Yeah, there's a definite chance that
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone's gonna say they have it and
they're gonna use that name any name that
[SPEAKER_04]: becomes famous in cannabis Gets used.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, so someone asked about you
know, and so That's kind of like that's
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of where nl5, you know Just got
crossed to some very famous things and
[SPEAKER_04]: Neville made some very fucking famous
lines off it and There wasn't that much
[SPEAKER_04]: weed strains back then and the combination
of that and high times Being like the
[SPEAKER_04]: premier magazine in the 90s and you get
all these high-quality glossy photos and
[SPEAKER_04]: all the The cannabis cups and there was
only one cannabis cup a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah So this shit got hella famous
Legendary, you know, yeah and You know one
[SPEAKER_04]: and what about one?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that what about you know one Oh
Denali's question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh I didn't see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean and l1 is probably the closest
thing to Steve Murphy Afghan It's it's
[SPEAKER_04]: it's got a little bit of discrepancy
between the guys involved as to what
[SPEAKER_04]: exactly is in it yeah, but you know,
it's that's kind of irrelevant because
[SPEAKER_04]: what actually got sold is what got sent to
Neville and Everybody should know that
[SPEAKER_04]: Neville got it in in in 84 85 and spent
two or three years Seeing what he had so
[SPEAKER_04]: if you bought northern lights in 85 or 86
or even 87 from his catalog It was a
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking hodgepodge of any of the lines all
blended together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it wasn't until about 88 that It
wasn't about I'm gonna turn off my light
[SPEAKER_04]: because people are bitching it wasn't
about till 88 that uh He started coming
[SPEAKER_04]: out with nl1 nl2 and nl5.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah right and You know, and so and then
so then these numbers get attached I think
[SPEAKER_04]: 1989 late 88 is when nl5 Hayes got
released.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and nl5 skunk 1 And nl5 this and so
nl1 nl2, you know when it went to sensei
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they just called nl1 northern
lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and they called nl2 Hindu kuch And
so lots of people got nl because it was
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the most common things so Yeah,
so I had to screenshot something that's
[SPEAKER_04]: fun no Yeah, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean people ask questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I'll get it sometimes not it's
really hard to like Pat your head and rub
[SPEAKER_04]: your stomach at the same time So like I
try to chat about something and sound like
[SPEAKER_04]: you know Fairly have a have some flow and
then I read a question and I think about
[SPEAKER_04]: it and all of a sudden I'm not talking and
I'm just staring at the screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So forgive me for all that, you know if I
miss your question I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the way it works So,
you know, I've chatted about this a bunch
[SPEAKER_04]: before on some of the previous podcasts
and a little bit more detail but That's
[SPEAKER_04]: what got it famous That that is the story
that is that is that is the story and so
[SPEAKER_04]: now Anytime anything becomes famous,
you know, it's kind of like music or
[SPEAKER_04]: fashion or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets fucking recycled Right,
like it gets old because new and most
[SPEAKER_04]: people don't know about it And then all of
a sudden people are like I've got this
[SPEAKER_04]: ancient nl5 cut and I'm making beans with
it I've got this this this you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know and maybe maybe Matt you could
explain the booth cut or the I Don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: I I've never talked to voting about that
one and I keep me to ask him because
[SPEAKER_03]: people ask it a lot But I don't know the
the history on that one so, I mean people
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and you know people asked about
Bob Hemphill and you know and and and Ella
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff like that and so people have
been people, you know It's really hard
[SPEAKER_04]: when you get seat when you get seeds in
line That are that are 25 30 years old
[SPEAKER_04]: plus Provenance on it becomes difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right, you know Apparently,
you know Hemphill used to work in with the
[SPEAKER_04]: coastal seeds collective And apparently,
you know, he got it through some friend of
[SPEAKER_04]: cog use You know But nl1 was sold for you
know, what probably 20 years?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah for a long time for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was it was sold it was and there was
nothing Never a specific cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean Neville had some breeding males
that he used Nl1 and nl2 and Neville's
[SPEAKER_04]: thing was almost always males Yeah,
they were part of his breeding males.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it wasn't like nl5 Well while never
Neville just had one cutting that had to
[SPEAKER_04]: be kept alive Yeah, nl1 was kind of like a
line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and so any like Durbin poison or
something, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so anytime there's a line It's a lot
harder to lose the line Than it is when
[SPEAKER_04]: you're dependent on one specific cut To
stay alive and keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and the other thing is Because these
these these fucking Dutch guys are such
[SPEAKER_04]: businessmen when you're not sharing a cut
amongst your homies and your good friends
[SPEAKER_04]: it Exponentially increases the chance that
some kind of disease or accident or
[SPEAKER_04]: drought or worker error is gonna kill your
fucking cut That greed will get you and
[SPEAKER_04]: then you haven't shared it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it gets longer Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, and you know, and so Ben and Alan
drunkers aren't generous people They
[SPEAKER_04]: weren't sharing they weren't sharing shit
with anybody, you know And you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean it it Nl5 is super famous nl is
super famous that we went through probably
[SPEAKER_04]: a 10-year period where nobody gave a shit
Probably starting right around the Kush
[SPEAKER_04]: South We're going into cookie era.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Where old things were just old and
unpopular?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just yeah things like northern
lights skunk one These were a cheese
[SPEAKER_03]: things that that like people are kind of
looking at now like oh, they got the
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking cheese They got the big like if I
saw that in a in a store with tons of
[SPEAKER_03]: clones and you know the early mid-2000s
it's like Huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: I give me some of that new shit Nobody was
worried about that because it was so
[SPEAKER_03]: abundant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, I mean we had it I can't remember
who said it but it's absolutely true You
[SPEAKER_04]: know 15 20 years ago you you bought seeds
from nirvana gypsy nirvana And you got
[SPEAKER_04]: free skunk one seeds because he might as
well because you had so many of them and
[SPEAKER_04]: it was so common It was you know,
you had to give them away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, cuz nobody wanted to buy them Yeah,
it was super abundant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's a thing where everything's
so common.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would anyone want it and people?
[SPEAKER_04]: Taste and change, you know people's you
know taste changes and then it becomes
[SPEAKER_04]: rare and Then people want it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but most people in cannabis don't
hold on to anything unless it's currently
[SPEAKER_04]: profitable So what what once becomes we've
we've seen it over and over and over and
[SPEAKER_04]: over again You know where something that
was once abundant becomes uber rare or
[SPEAKER_04]: lost to time Like I'll say it straight up
if it you know, hopefully he pops on here
[SPEAKER_04]: this time But if it wasn't for CSI loving
the Urkel and breeding with it a ton Most
[SPEAKER_04]: people wouldn't have access to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, his prolific breeding is probably
the reason why that genetics survived
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I'm not saying he's the only
person that held it No, buddy,
[SPEAKER_04]: but yeah, I used to know I mean,
we're not gonna talk about purples very
[SPEAKER_04]: long here tonight, but like I used to know
dozens upon dozens of growers 15 years ago
[SPEAKER_04]: that ran Urkel and you and then Diesel and
Kush gets popular and like six people held
[SPEAKER_04]: on to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Literally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's yeah, that's how it goes,
dude And it's not and the reason why I
[SPEAKER_04]: brought that up is because that's how
super skunk became almost extinct That's
[SPEAKER_04]: how nobody can find the the dead skunk
turps That's how all these things become
[SPEAKER_04]: rare or hoarded or extinct is they're so
common.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody thinks they need to care to
preserve it and Then hippies and growers
[SPEAKER_04]: start looking around Who's got that old
school and they can't fucking find it and
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of times the name game happens It'll
get a different name or you know Someone
[SPEAKER_03]: makes seeds with it and he has a different
name that he carries on with so people
[SPEAKER_03]: don't even know to look in that direction
for Said one of these baselines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we've talked about that before too
where I love the counterculture aspect of
[SPEAKER_04]: Americans giving weed nicknames.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but for lineage, it's a real pain in
the ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's terrible because we take whatever
the name of the actual thing is and it
[SPEAKER_04]: gets a nickname and Then it goes to a
different crew and they give it a
[SPEAKER_04]: different fucking nickname Yeah,
and then it goes to this other crew and
[SPEAKER_04]: they give it a spin on that name Yeah,
and then 20 years goes by and you're
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to trace what the hell it is Yeah
playing telephone and you got to go
[SPEAKER_04]: through four or five nicknames back and
then you get to the core thing and Then
[SPEAKER_04]: you and then the trail goes dry So,
you know, I mean So now after 10 or 15
[SPEAKER_04]: years of nobody giving a shit about
Northern Lights It's hot Yeah people want
[SPEAKER_04]: to try these ancient things that they grew
up when they were kids reading about or
[SPEAKER_04]: these the first wheat the first like true
famous wheat yeah, you know, they want to
[SPEAKER_04]: see what's up they want to see what's up
with it and You know and so now because
[SPEAKER_04]: there's interest Now all of a sudden where
there's interest there's economy and
[SPEAKER_04]: people start popping up with that Yeah All
over the place and most people probably
[SPEAKER_04]: don't know that there was two completely
distinct cuts that were used One from
[SPEAKER_04]: America and one from home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and there was a seed line But it was
given out to nobody and then you see stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: where I've got nl5 pure Well, how yeah,
yeah lots of that right how yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know You know, I mean you can you can
talk you can you can know that that
[SPEAKER_04]: Neville had it pure Because the guy that
made it says I sent it to him pure along
[SPEAKER_04]: with the rest of it Yeah, and that will
says I got it pure from dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, they both agree Here's when I sent
it it exists, but did you share it with
[SPEAKER_04]: anybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, so everybody has a bunch of hybrids or
Canadians got it and sold their shit and
[SPEAKER_04]: then people get it and it's got a name
attached and they're like You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: um There it is, yeah you know and because
we're cannabis and because all of our
[SPEAKER_04]: stories are kind of black market or
underground or prohibition it gets really
[SPEAKER_04]: difficult to Sometimes it comes down to
who you choose to believe Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's a lot of the time with a lot of
these strains And so some people will get
[SPEAKER_04]: like nl and they'll and the guy will be
like I've had this for 30 years It never
[SPEAKER_04]: left the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's this yeah, and they're like
great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this that's all the proof.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start breeding with it and it's this
and now it's labeled All over the place
[SPEAKER_03]: and people are buying it and is it that
One thing one thing I also noticed was
[SPEAKER_03]: that during the phylos era A lot of people
would get said clone that they got with
[SPEAKER_03]: dubious heritage or whatever they
submitted to phylos and By doing so say
[SPEAKER_03]: that phylos verified their clone is
legitimate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, yeah Yeah that happened that
started happening a lot too and that was a
[SPEAKER_03]: real problem because and as we learned
Allegedly shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah phylos couldn't tell people any kind
of plant relation with any consistency I
[SPEAKER_04]: mean the thing that maybe we should say
this about CSI is that it doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_04]: what it is but CSI sent in thought this is
how Matt myself and CSI discovered that
[SPEAKER_04]: phylos was really really really full of it
We had some evidence before but this was
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of one of the big kickers Was that
CSI had made a cross?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he sent in both parents and I don't
know if he wants to story out so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, yeah No, I'll shut up about it then I
didn't even mention what it was,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I'll just say this we discovered that
their genetic sequencing Wasn't as strong
[SPEAKER_04]: as we would have hoped.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was it was definitely
disappointing with the consistency of it
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and so people thought that their
genetic testing was like American genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah where you can have 23 and me or some
shit and be like, oh my god, I'm 5%
[SPEAKER_04]: Norwegian and You know grandpa was from
Germany and this guy and I'm like and I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: part African or whatever Yeah,
and we were hoping that same kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: accuracy would be transferred into wheat
Yeah, and I'm trying to move Caleb in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh We'll see Caleb click the thing and say
request to join if you can if you if you
[SPEAKER_03]: see how to do that Hit the request to join
button so I can Add you in when you got
[SPEAKER_04]: time All right, go ahead Yeah,
so I mean it it and you know in order the
[SPEAKER_04]: other the other thing about it is is for
like talking about human genetics is
[SPEAKER_04]: geneticists can go to like a pure
Norwegian or a pure Japanese or a pure
[SPEAKER_04]: Chinese bird or whatever and they can
start comparing DNA yeah and Seeing these
[SPEAKER_04]: different things and they know how to
sequence it if it would be amazing if DNA
[SPEAKER_04]: evidence had existed in Holland in the
80s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and Neville and an SSC and and
sensei in these early groups would have
[SPEAKER_04]: been able to like put down markers of what
was what Yeah, and then we could have seen
[SPEAKER_04]: their descendants because you'd have
something to compare it to Yeah But that's
[SPEAKER_04]: not always case.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not always the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really, you know, so it remains a dream
because Here he is
[SPEAKER_04]: Sir your lighting is terrible But if you
just you look like you look like you're on
[SPEAKER_04]: 60 minutes and you're one of those like
grayed out You know like guys with this
[SPEAKER_04]: protection program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too bright in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Too bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I ain't trying to you know Will you
look beautiful?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you So maybe I talk a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe I'll do like an introduction Not
that one's needed and then I'll shut up
[SPEAKER_04]: and get out of the way So part of the
reason why we did we we decided to do this
[SPEAKER_04]: selection tonight was because it blends
something that's currently going on with
[SPEAKER_04]: something that's extremely famous and Has
a bunch of history to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just spent a whole bunch of time
chatting about the history of it and The
[SPEAKER_04]: simple and maybe like, you know mellow way
to talk about it is that in Our search of
[SPEAKER_04]: history.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started getting in contact with some of
these original Northern Lights crew people
[SPEAKER_04]: and hearing their story and As part of
that, we got we got some seats Matt got
[SPEAKER_04]: some seats and then Matt and and Caleb
here decided to collaborate on it and and
[SPEAKER_04]: Caleb donated some space and some time and
some energy and they Did a bunch of stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: both growing out phenos looking within the
line making hybrids and all that and so I
[SPEAKER_04]: was I was involved as much as listening to
them talk about it so I'll shut up and
[SPEAKER_04]: turn it over to them because They are
about to offer up some seeds of what they
[SPEAKER_04]: have going on And it might be you know,
some of the first real NL to come on the
[SPEAKER_04]: market in a while So Matt and Caleb,
why don't you chat about?
[SPEAKER_04]: What you found and what you saw and what
interested you and da da da da da Well
[SPEAKER_00]: first things first, you know, I'm you know
when I posted up on IG, you know There's
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a few people who are like,
you know, what did what did Matt have to
[SPEAKER_00]: do with any of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't even be growing these seeds
if Matt kind of you know had all that
[SPEAKER_00]: dialogue with you know, mystery man And
you know, he's the one who you know put
[SPEAKER_00]: all that together he's the one Who sourced
these seeds essentially so I wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: growing nothing without Matt, you know
Making that first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, maybe maybe I'll throw in one
more thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everyone knows When you know breeders
like us get together, it's super common
[SPEAKER_04]: for some breeding to be a collaborative
process Right, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy's got some seeds, you know They
both have an idea this other person has
[SPEAKER_04]: some room that they're willing to put
towards the idea or a greenhouse or some
[SPEAKER_04]: Indoor space they come up with a plan and
you breed together and people might not JJ
[SPEAKER_04]: of the transaction but but everybody
everybody, you know Lots lots of friends
[SPEAKER_04]: were breeders kind of collaborate on
little things like that all the time It's
[SPEAKER_04]: super common just so people just so people
know so, you know You know Matt had the
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds You know CSI had the space in skill
And skill and you know and ability we all
[SPEAKER_04]: had the interest in the history behind it
and really wanted to see what was in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and so it you know, the project happened
right and You know, some people know some
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't that the very first,
you know clone I ever grew came from my
[SPEAKER_00]: dad and that was northern lights back in
1994 You know, so it's about that one,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I remember I mean I
rocked it on and off until about 2002 when
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost it and It was a cola plant super
frosty a decent density, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: not not like rock hard Girl Scout cookies
or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Described the nose, but I'm absolutely
horrible at describing, you know The
[SPEAKER_00]: smells so when people ask I'm like it
smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know That's not my forte.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I'm more of a visual, you know,
oh it looks like This, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's similar to this in the looks
department blah blah blah You know other
[SPEAKER_00]: than you know, it smells great or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the dude for for the sniffer Yeah
Yeah, I mean When you lost it was it
[SPEAKER_03]: something you kept looking for like when
you know that clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was one of the things that you know
Family and friends, you know All had it
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you know, I lost it and I went
looking and nobody had it Everybody lost
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's how it goes Yeah,
but people are asking if it purple No,
[SPEAKER_00]: no Not not the one I got from my dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't I don't really recall it
Even remotely having any type of purple to
[SPEAKER_00]: it at all Yeah, and and these these you
know, nl5 seeds that you know I just ran
[SPEAKER_00]: there is very very little if any,
you know Actual purple to any of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you know But then again,
uh, sometimes when you're making seed You
[SPEAKER_00]: know the purple traits kind of kind of
tend to take a back seat Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of purple things will be halfway
green, you know or all the way green,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know When they're making seeds,
so I mean Mendo purple Does that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's you know more green than purple
even under cool temperatures and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything when it's full of seeds Yeah,
you know, so But I think the plants have
[SPEAKER_04]: different Processes when they're pregnant
versus not right, right, you know They do
[SPEAKER_04]: they do very different things their their
goal is different at the time and and I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't even think about this but I'm I'm
feeding seeded out plants You know
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen fuck all the way through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm not trying to cut off their
nitro source You know early like it would
[SPEAKER_00]: a flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, the goal is is healthy mature
seeds not attractive flower Exactly flower
[SPEAKER_04]: is just the carrier for the seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very different.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very different feeding regimen To
get where you want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and flower Which is why when you have
a failed run and a bunch of flower and no
[SPEAKER_04]: seed Maybe maybe I should mention
something is that see, you know CSI has
[SPEAKER_04]: actual is you know He has some pictures of
some of these old gardens and stuff like
[SPEAKER_04]: that but unfortunately since it was all
prohibition II back then they were on
[SPEAKER_04]: Polaroids and You learn with Polaroids
that they fade over time You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so they become the the colors start to
become washed out the edges start to
[SPEAKER_04]: become less distinct so, you know,
he cataloged some of it and You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can see you can get a general idea,
but it's not the sharpest of picks,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have thousands of these Polaroids,
you know for you know, the better part of
[SPEAKER_00]: a decade and now now they're Not much to
look at yeah, that's a bummer dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's such a buffer Right, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just something you didn't know at the
time Who knew that over 15 20 25 years
[SPEAKER_04]: Polaroids would would fate right a regular
picture developed at a you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know Old-school style will stay good
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes Polaroids don't you know, I showed us
and them all while I had the chance Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, we all should have done
things differently when we were younger
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's the common theme Your
cameras slowly but surely burning out
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, so the best thing is is I
was having I was having a conversation
[SPEAKER_04]: with with our buddy Pip Who is gonna drop
some seeds soon and he might come on here
[SPEAKER_04]: and chat with Matt and I but he didn't
really want to show his face So I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely gonna show him this CSI tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah right here Because it's exactly what
he's looking for This embodied voice
[SPEAKER_04]: coming out of coming out of the darkness
isn't that how they always used to do This
[SPEAKER_04]: is very 60 minutes in the 90s,
you know Now I just need the voice tech
[SPEAKER_03]: that voice tech Yeah, yeah Tell us what
you saw man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell it tell us what you saw in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so The the seeds that right and I
have available Are basically an open
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination from 47 plants 27 females 20
males just open pollinated and You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was there was definitely good bad in
the ugly in there There was one plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: was near identical to the norm light I
grew, you know from 94 on from my dad
[SPEAKER_00]: Smelled like it looked extremely similar
to it, you know all of that And you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I I had a one of my good old old buddies
from you know From that area, you know You
[SPEAKER_00]: know check checking things out with me as
it was progressing and he was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, that's that's just like the plant We
we used to rock, you know 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was a lot of variety in there
One of my favorites, of course Was this
[SPEAKER_00]: one that was super frosty kind of a
popcorn nugget thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good stretch And it was kind of
bubblegummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I that's how I you know Describe it,
but I don't know maybe other people would
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Just describe the smell
different, but it was really nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're definitely saving that one and then
there one that was I just have it written
[SPEAKER_00]: down as stinky as fuck but It's it had
like ten different smells, you know top
[SPEAKER_00]: middle bottom And I can't describe that
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, there's there's guys with
noses who are like, oh, yeah That's blah
[SPEAKER_00]: blah blah blah blah blah blah,
you know and list 20 different smells on
[SPEAKER_00]: something But all I know is it smelled
amazing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that one That one's definitely a
keeper and then there were some other ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know ranged you know this way and
that way and You know might might end up
[SPEAKER_00]: being keepers might not definitely gonna
give them a couple few Runs to decide on
[SPEAKER_00]: which ones are gonna kind of make the cut
for future projects, you know So that's
[SPEAKER_03]: what I'm stoked about is that we get to
see them as clones not just seed seed moms
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but as clones and they get
clones of every single it's it's pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: Expansive and it was a it was a cool It
was cool that and I know you know He he he
[SPEAKER_03]: credits me with getting the seeds and
stuff But it was it was really cool to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to look inside CSI's mindset as he
did these selections what he was looking
[SPEAKER_03]: for How we went about it how many clones
he was keeping a beach.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned a lot I learned a lot from dude
during this so He put in the work.
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter what he says.
[SPEAKER_03]: He put in the fucking work on this stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, maybe and maybe I should add
something in where Caleb and I chat a
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch about like, you know Finos he's
found in seed lines before That didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: survive like, you know, the backup clone
didn't survive and he lost it and he's
[SPEAKER_04]: like, well, you know, I got X amount of
these seeds I can find it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Maybe you know how excited were you do
to find something that was pretty close to
[SPEAKER_00]: the spitting image of your lost plant I
Was stoked on it But you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was honestly more excited with some of
these other ones that you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you know back in 94 you're the the
reality is you know, it's Just a traded
[SPEAKER_00]: clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no idea, you know where it came
from how many speeds it got selected from
[SPEAKER_00]: you know anything about it, you know,
and that's the thing with traded clones is
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it might be selected from one or
four and or a hundred, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like, you know having the
opportunity to actually select from better
[SPEAKER_04]: than one Yeah for sure I think too that
like there are things for all of us now
[SPEAKER_04]: that we're all older where some of the
strains that You grow first and you build
[SPEAKER_04]: your first relationships with as a grower
In your mind because you're learning so
[SPEAKER_04]: much then and this is your kind bud plant
Right, right, you know, and they really
[SPEAKER_04]: stick with you those and you know,
you think back like oh, what could I have
[SPEAKER_04]: done?
[SPEAKER_04]: With that plant when I actually had some
some knowledge When I had that plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was an idiot, you know I was 19 or
something and I didn't know Jack and now
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, you know, what could I do if I
had it now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right Yeah, I'm a little interested
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know this is an NL talk But are you
do you want to talk about any of the pinks
[SPEAKER_03]: and purfs stuff you're singing to since
that's a big project You have going on
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh We can touch on it just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know Had me amped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm definitely gonna You know try to
post up a little bit more on that soon
[SPEAKER_00]: just because There's there's some
interesting stuff in in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and uh, yeah that one keeper I was
telling you about It smells better than
[SPEAKER_00]: 99% of weed I've come across so that's
wild, you know Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a purple feno pure green,
you know, no purple traits to it
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man the smell is just so overpowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I think it could be a A passed around
with keeper as long as it's over 5% THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah We should mention that some of the
terpiest things Tend to be lower THC,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a ratio.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a there's a there's a ratio there
that's not fully understood But a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: times things that are extremely human
perception terpy Don't tend to be the most
[SPEAKER_04]: potent there are things out there that
have both but a lot of them don't so we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see and Have I told you much or anything
about this uh, this pinks and perps plant
[SPEAKER_04]: I I heard it through your com you and Matt
chatted about it and he called me all
[SPEAKER_04]: excited Yeah, because it's rare that you
sound that excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah something that you found So he was
I've never hear him overstate anything
[SPEAKER_03]: about anything dude pops thousands of
seeds So when he tells me dude,
[SPEAKER_04]: like this is special Yeah, I mean,
I think I think homie told me something
[SPEAKER_04]: like he thinks it might be like the best,
you know, he's found Yeah, which for some
[SPEAKER_04]: for someone like you to say who pops
literally like thousands of seeds over a
[SPEAKER_04]: number of years and searches through them
That's really something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, you know and really is I like to
give to give credit to you know What what
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, you know kind of produce these
kind of things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah This particular plant, you know,
it has Mendo purple in its background But
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no purple traits to this plant at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mendo purple has this strong mango
Trait that pops up in the ones and this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing is that mango times a hundred,
you know It's it's just the strongest
[SPEAKER_00]: mango I've ever smelled Wow You know as
you know and a bunch more fruit,
[SPEAKER_00]: too But uh, you know, I know it gets that
mango, you know at least you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of it from from the Mendo perps
So, you know Could be cool as long as I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't lose the clone Yeah, I mean one of
the things that the Mendo piece certainly
[SPEAKER_04]: has is it's got pretty wide genetic
diversity So there's a lot of turps in
[SPEAKER_04]: there, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then you throw it on something else
that's also turpy and maybe wide and you
[SPEAKER_04]: can get these Unusual things that have a
potential to pop up, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean that's kind of like people should
know this too And maybe I should say it
[SPEAKER_04]: right now where it's like if you cross
something to like that You know to buck to
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know to deep chunk You're gonna
get a lot of deep chunk And it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_04]: really consistent, you know, and there's
certain thing you throw certain things on
[SPEAKER_04]: cookies and it looks very cookie Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so people get frustrated when you
cross two very wide Things because you can
[SPEAKER_04]: get a bunch of junk and you can get a
bunch of this and that and it's all like
[SPEAKER_04]: unpredictable Oh, yeah, but then every
once in a while amongst all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this gem because it's so wide and
unpredictable and you're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh whoa What is that thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes the frustration and the effort
pays off because a really wide base of
[SPEAKER_04]: things to look through and Maybe I should
say this too is when you know when Caleb
[SPEAKER_04]: was referencing when he did the open
pollination that there was some gem some
[SPEAKER_04]: mids some junk That's 90s wheat.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a wide genetic base you're
gonna get Amazing midsy junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all in combo and also on that
pinks and perps one, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was I was I always forget this but I
Grew up when I made those and found that
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing out 180 of those things So
there was only one like it out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred and eighty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know So I wonder how it's gonna
breed because it was such a outlier Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, were there other other phenos that
were more consistent and like pop it up
[SPEAKER_03]: more often Oh, yeah, the the the purple
ones were predominant Yeah to find an
[SPEAKER_00]: actual green one in in this hybrid was
actually the rarity You know most most
[SPEAKER_00]: everything was, you know some form of
light pink or lavender You know all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way through, you know purple to almost
black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, but uh, yeah, the the
green ones were were rare You know and and
[SPEAKER_00]: I I probably kept out of the hundred and
eighty I probably kept about 20 or so of
[SPEAKER_00]: the of the darker purple ones and just the
real terpier ones the you know But they're
[SPEAKER_00]: all I don't think I I have any other green
ones out of the hole all All the purples
[SPEAKER_00]: and the blacks.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a wild man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah That it was so consistently that and
then this one pops up Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and so maybe I should throw this out
there just real quick before we totally
[SPEAKER_04]: lose the thread on it is on some of these
ones that you found that that the one
[SPEAKER_04]: that's Super frosty and smells to you like
bubblegum and the one that kind of reminds
[SPEAKER_04]: you strongly of your dad dad's dad's NL
and such You're probably planning on doing
[SPEAKER_04]: some more breeding with those select
females, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I'm already working on that too,
so the first round of course was the open
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination and now I have a room that's a
couple few weeks into flower and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: all the keeper females and My keeper male
my favorite male out of the whole bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: which is I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's like almost a milk chocolatey
smelling male and he's super pungent and
[SPEAKER_00]: He almost looks like a bigger version of
Purple indica, you know, that's that was
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a throwback from the same You know
Washington area as these seeds came from
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so, you know, there's there's
something to that and like I've told a
[SPEAKER_00]: Told Matt I'm not sure if I I told you not
so but uh When the norm lights I used to
[SPEAKER_00]: have You know occasionally a throw a late
man or whatever whatever and I grew out a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of s1 seed Well, I gave you know
some of these s ones to my buddy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know clones of the s ones anyway,
and He Accidentally crossed it to train
[SPEAKER_00]: wreck and When that stuff was grown out it
had that same chocolate enos that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling in this thing, you know when
grown outdoors, so I don't know if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just coincidence or or what but you know
It could just be Same same similar
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics the power of accidents.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm the power of accidents,
so maybe I should throw this in there too,
[SPEAKER_04]: so if With with the these seeds that Matt
and Caleb are offering up this open
[SPEAKER_04]: pollination what that's gonna give you is
You know, that's gonna give you your own
[SPEAKER_04]: ability to hunt through the line and it's
going to be very wide You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you could find gem Just like he found
you know You could you could absolutely
[SPEAKER_04]: perhaps find what you wouldn't know that
look, you know There could be bubblegum
[SPEAKER_04]: smelling ones there could be this ones
there could be there's a reasonably good
[SPEAKER_04]: chance that somewhere in there is those
phenos pop up again and then give them X
[SPEAKER_04]: amount of months to do some more breeding
and We'll get a chance to see if some of
[SPEAKER_04]: these selected females breed true for the
traits that he liked Because those will be
[SPEAKER_04]: on offer too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of like For people that
don't know that's kind of like when you
[SPEAKER_04]: get old seeds or seeds that you want to
preserve One of the best things to do to
[SPEAKER_04]: keep the genetic diversity of the line is
just to open pollinate everything right
[SPEAKER_04]: and then you know, you can set aside,
you know some seeds from selected phenos
[SPEAKER_04]: and you can keep certain phenos and start
breeding with them and intentionally and
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing where it takes you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of like the that's one of
the processes of Taking old seeds and
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to both preserve the line,
but then take it in certain directions
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep That's kind of how I and you've done
that a number of times with like various
[SPEAKER_00]: heirloom strains that you've come across,
you know always open pollinate Step one
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you know, you can do whatever you
want past that, you know directional this
[SPEAKER_00]: way that way or the other You know and
everybody else can too as long as you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, you share the seed and all that,
you know Yeah Are there any other projects
[SPEAKER_03]: you're super stoked about past that like
any FEM projects coming up that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: you're you're pumped about Oh,
I got that patient zero common Patient
[SPEAKER_03]: zeros on its way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Don't know that that one's gonna be
interesting I'm not sure how that one's
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna turn out but you know, we'll see it
could be cool Maybe you could explain for
[SPEAKER_04]: people because you have so many names
because you're so prolific about things
[SPEAKER_00]: what is patient zero, you know patients
eros, uh, you know, uh Basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the just the Urkel across the
Pakistani Chitral Kush and I grew out a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred and something of those years ago
and my absolute favorite plan of that one
[SPEAKER_00]: was a Was it was the one I named patient
zero?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's it's kind of as long as
you like a little turpentine on your diet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty alright And so maybe I'll add
that to it too where it's like a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: modern breeding today is One-offs where
people hybridize something and then just
[SPEAKER_04]: toss it out to the public What he just
described is what's known as like
[SPEAKER_04]: multi-stage breeding Where he made across
he grew out a bunch of phenos he picked
[SPEAKER_04]: one that he liked and now he's doing
further work with that, you know itself
[SPEAKER_04]: probably crossing it to itself and
Crossing it to other Cuttings that he has
[SPEAKER_04]: in the stable that he thinks might blend
well with him, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What one of my favorites I actually have
flowering right now is The Mendo purple
[SPEAKER_00]: number 54 selection from you know growing
out that last hundred and something of
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm the Urkel 103 You know s1 and then
you know those, you know, I reversed the
[SPEAKER_00]: 103 slapped on the Mendo Man, those are
uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean as uniform as you can get really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's cool Interestingly,
the Mendo is extremely dominant on it
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're all they look more like
Mendo purple plants then you can barely
[SPEAKER_04]: see any Urkel to them and the both of
those selections were made out of that
[SPEAKER_04]: room that I came and visited you and saw
before you The s1s of Urkel and the s1s of
[SPEAKER_04]: Mendo P. Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But uh, yeah, yeah Definitely
interesting though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Don't know Yeah, I was excited to like
about I don't know if you want to talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about any of the purple punch stuff or if
that's you know what I mean, like the
[SPEAKER_03]: Findings in that you're kind of saying
that are unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um the We've talked and the most
surprising thing about breeding with
[SPEAKER_00]: purple punch is how fucking Stable it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean actually right when you're working
with you know, it doesn't matter what you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, oh geez diesels chem dogs Girl
scouts, you know, and then all the popular
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff based off all those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're gonna find a nice portion of
you know hermaphrodism, you know more so
[SPEAKER_00]: if you know your your environment's not a
you know, perfect But you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you have a perfect environment,
there's always gonna be a percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: those But the purple punches have almost
the lowest Levels are hermaphrodism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen in any hybrids so I mean,
that's that's useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something people look for and I
think like the fact that it popped up in
[SPEAKER_03]: an og GDP was kind of shocking,
you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah And you know, I was I was the I
wasn't a huge fan of purple punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even You know start growing it
until a couple years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I I kind of ignored it and was like
I got plenty of my own oracle hybrids I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but you know, it has traits that it
put puts forward and you really can't
[SPEAKER_03]: argue with it, you know Yeah, I was the
same way, you know, we both just kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: dodged hype for a while with like the
fucking the The gorilla glue and that and
[SPEAKER_03]: then end up at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck that shit's kind of good there,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Last one to the party.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an interesting Aspect that people
maybe should hear about is sometimes you
[SPEAKER_04]: can have an amazing cut that checks a
bunch of boxes And it breeds like shit,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's right all over the place that throws
a bunch of junk and it does the quality
[SPEAKER_04]: inherent in the cut itself Doesn't seem to
translate to its children very well and
[SPEAKER_04]: then other times you can take something
like Purple punch that they're just
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about that has a lot of nice
traits but kind of lacks high or whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: else and you don't think that much of it
and Then you cross it to things and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: children come out incredibly amazing with
a bunch of traits that you like Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes a breeding parent can
actually be kind of a crappy Crappy plant
[SPEAKER_04]: in some ways like Caleb likes a lot of the
s ones of my Mendo P quite a bit more than
[SPEAKER_04]: the mama Oh, yeah, you know the mama is
amazing for breeding but as an actual
[SPEAKER_04]: plant itself, there's some aspects to It
that are unpredictable and and it's low
[SPEAKER_04]: THC Right, right, but some of its children
and some of the things that it throws and
[SPEAKER_04]: when you breed And sometimes you might
take something like purple punch that
[SPEAKER_04]: people make fun of and you breed with it
And you're like, wow, this thing is
[SPEAKER_04]: amazing It throws all these traits
consistently that are useful Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean like you could talk for a minute
about how stable that bubblegum cut you
[SPEAKER_04]: have it and why you use it And so many
different things because it throws like
[SPEAKER_04]: rock, you know, it doesn't rot very easily
It's got incredible structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It densens things up, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know about It's really not
the densest cut out there, but it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's definitely a You know as as rot
resistant as you can you can get a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know on my worst year you're Ever
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was aiming for like 700 pounds
or something and Then we had six inches of
[SPEAKER_00]: rain the last week of September,
you know first week of October and I lost
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 to 60 percent of that garden to mold
and The only thing that came through that
[SPEAKER_00]: garden with probably less than 1% rot
ratio was that bubblegum cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's weaning So, you know tons of people
are like, you know, what's your best,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know mold resistant, you know,
blah blah blah Well right there,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know So that outdoor Queen Yeah,
so someone sometimes those traits like
[SPEAKER_04]: they were just talking about like,
you know Caleb does an enormous amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding so for him to say that the purple
punch is some of the most non intersex
[SPEAKER_04]: stable thing he's ever worked with Is
saying something You know when he says
[SPEAKER_04]: that like this plant is almost immune to
mold and it's the most mold resistant
[SPEAKER_04]: plant I've ever seen and it passes that
trait to some progeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's useful information I see a lot of
people commenting on the purple punch
[SPEAKER_03]: strength and like when Breeding has
changed From where it was maybe ten years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago on what we would select for potency
wise what we wouldn't use what we would
[SPEAKER_03]: use certain one of us, you know Purple
punch all I'd ever heard about was how
[SPEAKER_03]: weak it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just never I never got into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: However It is a is a very extract centric
community now and With extracts pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: much everything's fucking strong So so a
lot of things are more turp based now
[SPEAKER_03]: where people are checking out what kind of
turps are being passed how they breed and
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean some people won't want it
won't Want to fuck with anything that
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't lay them out me I like all kinds
of ranges of different highs and I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: like being laid out So for me purple punch
is fucking perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah Yeah You know weed weed affects
humans in different ways Some of my
[SPEAKER_04]: favorite strains to smoke on a regular
basis the other two guys that were
[SPEAKER_04]: checked, you know They don't like it that
much on a big they agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's a super quality cut But it's not
something with their body chemistry that
[SPEAKER_04]: really adapts all that well Yeah,
I have friends that only like incredibly
[SPEAKER_04]: potent Indica's because they want to be
hammered down And a sativa makes them
[SPEAKER_04]: crawl up the wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I have other friends that smoke a
sativa and they relax Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, so can't cannabis and cannabis
and individual strains Don't think that
[SPEAKER_04]: the way it affects you is the way it
affects everyone There's a range there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah That's why I like keeping so
many different, you know Cultivars because
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I like a whole spectrum of
different things and I know other people
[SPEAKER_00]: too You know like different things so you
can't always breed for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely not Does the purple punch
reverse?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, it refers is fine interesting
so it reverses easily but won't ever throw
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex traits Yeah, yeah, that's kind of
odd in itself, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I got growing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I found a single ball or
Nanner on any of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, which is almost unheard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah Yeah, you're usually gonna get at
least ten to twenty percent, you know And
[SPEAKER_00]: I say ten to twenty percent and that could
just be one ball down low or one,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Late Nanner or something,
but there's always going to be like ten to
[SPEAKER_00]: twenty percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah And then there's certain things that
perm but reverse Right, right,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I mean we've talked before about
we're not gonna get into it too much But
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they you know, the old sour cuts
are famous for not reversing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah Or getting a handful of seed,
but they're also famous for the wrong
[SPEAKER_04]: conditions And they they throw Nanner's
that's can see I create seed in your room
[SPEAKER_00]: for flower production Yeah, it's really
easy to grow it boofy I had a I had some
[SPEAKER_00]: sour some sour days in a in a fully seeded
that room just recently and You know
[SPEAKER_00]: completely full of seed and about week
four it just starts balling up just
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging all kinds of our diesel balls So
there the whole room was completely seeded
[SPEAKER_00]: so it didn't have any risk of pollinating
in anything But you know, it still felt
[SPEAKER_00]: the need to you know, throw out just a ton
of balls Like what are you doing with
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see any pollen off of them,
but you know Yeah, yeah, I mean the you
[SPEAKER_04]: know the the what I consider to be the
original but you know It's the one I got
[SPEAKER_04]: the Chem D cut is pretty famous for
throwing a bunch of Nanner's at week three
[SPEAKER_04]: four But they're sterile You know,
they don't really they don't really you
[SPEAKER_04]: know They don't they don't really make
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that chem D or just chem D's in
general Seems yeah, they throw bananas
[SPEAKER_00]: like they're going out of style.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah It's a trait that goes there and so
I've had any number of friends or helpers
[SPEAKER_04]: or whatever on a light depth greenhouse
come to me panicked Because half the
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse has bananas popping out all
over right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, oh calm down calm down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's the D We're gonna be fine,
you know, and we're fine, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can find a bean Yeah, but you know you
do that with cherry pie or something and
[SPEAKER_04]: you have beans everywhere
[SPEAKER_04]: So certain things certain things are
different have different risky,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, there's different levels of
risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah So, I mean, maybe we should maybe we
should chat about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we should reel it back in for a
second part of the reason why we did this
[SPEAKER_04]: nl5 chat both starting in the 80s and
going through some of the history and then
[SPEAKER_04]: bringing Caleb on was to talk about the
project that that him and Matt have going
[SPEAKER_04]: and They they just dropped the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe Yes, or we're about to or just
did another dropped Caleb's Caleb site is
[SPEAKER_03]: humble CSI calm, correct Caleb Yeah,
that you could buy them on there or I'll
[SPEAKER_04]: write seed code calm Yeah, and so it's a
it's a it's a riot and and Caleb collab
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's a big open pollination of
genetics from One of the people that was
[SPEAKER_04]: intimately involved in the old nl crew So
the the provenance is excellent as far as
[SPEAKER_04]: like who it comes from And you know,
but then on top of that too, the proof is
[SPEAKER_04]: in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know it It's a chance for people
to maybe hunt around if you have if you're
[SPEAKER_04]: a little adventurous and look through
something old and something famous,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know And you know Caleb found a few
things in it that he was super excited
[SPEAKER_04]: about and so hopefully You guys will too
And one of the ways that we're gonna make
[SPEAKER_04]: sure that not everything is skittles og
cookie Cush mints whatever is by people
[SPEAKER_04]: taking effort and reviving some of these
old things and making fresh bats of
[SPEAKER_04]: batches of seed that are more viable and
Then getting them into people's hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the gene pool stays wider Yeah,
yeah, so not only is it a cool old project
[SPEAKER_04]: to some thing that's extremely famous and
there's potential in it but you can better
[SPEAKER_04]: believe that most modern breeding with a
few exceptions is the same 30 or 40 cuts
[SPEAKER_04]: blended in a bunch of different ways over
the last ten years and This harkens back
[SPEAKER_04]: to a much older time So there's a
possibility there that when you outcross
[SPEAKER_04]: things to something that aren't like each
other if you take these nl5s and you start
[SPEAKER_04]: throwing it on different stuff you have
you might get some unusual stuff you're
[SPEAKER_04]: Not expecting that's good right You know
Britain's fucking with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry guys No, it's like because that's
because that's the thing is a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: breeders say that like sometimes,
you know crossing two very distinct things
[SPEAKER_04]: together is Where you really get quality
pop?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah You know and you're certainly
introducing something older in the gene
[SPEAKER_04]: pool that was very common 20 30 years ago
But now is many generations interbred And
[SPEAKER_04]: so by these guys doing this project work
It's kind of getting thrown out there
[SPEAKER_04]: again where it can get bred into a lot of
modern stuff and people get to see what
[SPEAKER_04]: happens So, you know, you'll get more
opportunities to see what CSI is doing
[SPEAKER_04]: with the work In future breeding projects
that seem like they're already engaged And
[SPEAKER_04]: hopefully people are gonna buy a bunch of
this stuff and start posting and trying
[SPEAKER_04]: them out themselves And it's one of the
ways you can keep cannabis history Alive
[SPEAKER_04]: right and making the urge with the stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah You know mixing it with modern things
and seeing what happens, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right So what do you guys think would be
the best?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know available Plant line whatever out
there to cross to the nl5s You know I
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, I want to see the hogs breath
nl5 I think that would be cool if we could
[SPEAKER_03]: track that down and do that again It's
been out of my hands for a while,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think that would be interesting just
because of the terms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm How about you not so You know,
I actually think that It might cross well
[SPEAKER_04]: with something like the dog shit Okay,
okay, you know kind of a potentially
[SPEAKER_04]: almost a back cross potentially almost I
mean a back cross has to use the
[SPEAKER_04]: Technically the same cut to go back to but
maybe something that is very nl Because
[SPEAKER_04]: one thing I'll say about that dog shit
grown indoor is boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it look like 90s weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like lime green with bright orange hairs
and it just has that like nl type of like
[SPEAKER_04]: like look I was gonna say hydro,
but Caleb is purely organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't want to insult him or just that
like that like big sack of hydro and It's
[SPEAKER_04]: just super frosty and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so You know, but it might give it some
stretch and some vigor and it might kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of like and that's kind of like what I
like one of the things that I get
[SPEAKER_04]: interested about is crossing two different
things that you think have similar
[SPEAKER_04]: parentage behind them and Then you see if
you get some throwbacks Because both
[SPEAKER_04]: parents have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do have the dog shit in my latest
round So, you know, but it's getting cross
[SPEAKER_00]: to that that chocolatey Mm-hmm,
you know five male and Honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there were better there are males
that kind of looked more similar to dog
[SPEAKER_00]: shit but I you know, I didn't use them
personally for this round Because I liked
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know particular, you know
chocolate And if I was gonna throw out one
[SPEAKER_04]: more recommendation and combine the old
with the new one of Neville's most classic
[SPEAKER_04]: combinations was nl5 and skunk and I kind
of view the diesel family as What we have
[SPEAKER_04]: is surviving modern skunk Not that there's
not cheese and a couple other things like
[SPEAKER_04]: that, but I kind of view like sours as
American skunk Right or very very
[SPEAKER_04]: skunkish.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would be Kind of cool to see like
what we have now is skunk and what we have
[SPEAKER_04]: now is nl blended back together,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that was one of the most classic
best-selling and if they combine super
[SPEAKER_00]: well Yeah, I definitely have cheese in
there too, so, you know You know at least
[SPEAKER_00]: don't one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you talking skunk one or skunk?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean that's cheese is fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's obviously pure Skunk one that's
really old.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just thinking of certain diesels
just because I consider I consider certain
[SPEAKER_04]: diesels Modern that to me that even though
it doesn't have the name I consider a
[SPEAKER_04]: diesel to be like a skunk skunk skunkoid
type plant Right, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's rangy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's it's got that kind of skunk
type growth to it it's got these very I
[SPEAKER_04]: basically think of like gas and diesel as
It's not like roadkill but it is on that
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk spectrum Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like different angles of the same
turps Yeah, you know, yeah, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: how I see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know But yeah, and then the other
thing too is that you know You know you
[SPEAKER_04]: cross it to things you hope are gonna
Cross well and then you cross it to some
[SPEAKER_04]: things that are just random and sometimes
those random ones end up being The best
[SPEAKER_04]: ones because you really don't know and you
really don't know what genes are gonna pop
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right, and you really don't know
what recessive They're in there true true
[SPEAKER_04]: right like so to take it back to humans
Unless both parents have the gene you
[SPEAKER_04]: can't have kids with blue eyes or green
eyes You know you if one parent has the
[SPEAKER_04]: recessive the other parent has the
dominant it won't combine Right blonde
[SPEAKER_04]: hair is the same way both parents have to
have the blonde hair gene or the red hair
[SPEAKER_04]: gene or it won't pop and So sometimes if
you take two things that you think might
[SPEAKER_04]: have similar genes you might get some
recessives that Pop and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_04]: something unusual comes out, you know
Yeah, yeah, so Yeah, I promised to not
[SPEAKER_03]: hold Caleb too long I know he's got some
shit to do tonight, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm thankful for you coming and talking
about the Northern Lights I know
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody's super stoked to be able to
hear about it firsthand But yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: is there anything else you want to talk
about before we all balance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I think I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta go wrangle a five-year-old beast
Please yeah, no, you know Friday night
[SPEAKER_04]: isn't the easiest night for you so we
super appreciate you coming on and
[SPEAKER_04]: shooting the ship and all that,
you know and You know, I briefly saw your
[SPEAKER_04]: face in the shadows there for a minute
before the pitch black kicked in But yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, that's that's kind of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanted to chat about you know,
we wanted to chat about the history We
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted to clear up some misconceptions and
we wanted people to hear about some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: specifics of what we Was available how it
was made what you what we saw in it And
[SPEAKER_04]: let people go from there So as always
everyone, thank you for giving us part of
[SPEAKER_03]: your Friday night, you know, okay Where do
you where where can people find your seats
[SPEAKER_03]: again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Humble CSI calm.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah humble CSI calm.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll grab the nl5, please Hey,
go experience it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you let them know about yours,
too Yeah, I got it too, but but you know
[SPEAKER_04]: support the man Yeah, so, you know both
both both guys have it you can get them
[SPEAKER_04]: both off each of their individual websites
They were communicating a bunch during the
[SPEAKER_04]: during the grow they were talking about
what he was seeing sharing pictures and
[SPEAKER_04]: just you know and all that and so You
know, it's how a lot of it's how a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: passion projects get made today is with
People that have similar interests
[SPEAKER_04]: collaborating And making it work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So support it if you can if you you know,
it'd be great And it would spread out some
[SPEAKER_04]: old genetics and it would keep them alive
and you could do your little part to make
[SPEAKER_04]: sure that the gene pool stays wider And
hopefully find some fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah You know everybody enjoy their Friday
night as always there's a million
[SPEAKER_04]: questions we didn't get to But you can
always hit us up on our discord
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Matt and I chat up there a whole
bunch We're pretty responsive to questions
[SPEAKER_04]: and all that and so, you know every every
Friday night We'll try to bring you
[SPEAKER_04]: something new and pertinent and
interesting and bring on various friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have and all that and Kind of just push
the history and the info forward and at
[SPEAKER_04]: the very least you get seen not so naked
All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks everyone Enjoy everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a great night Good night Cheers
You
