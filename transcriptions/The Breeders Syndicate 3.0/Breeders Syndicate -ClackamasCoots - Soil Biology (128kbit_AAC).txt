[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Clack?
[SPEAKER_03]: How y'all doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: How y'all doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, people are getting notifications
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, some of you may have heard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, first off, I just gotta show this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I even start in on this,
let's go ahead and show this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go ahead and show this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh God, my ugly head cut it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is joint breath.
[SPEAKER_03]: Relishing the fact that Duke got popped.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever your views on anything are,
he's stoked he can go sell cuts that he
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't even have of the puck,
which is trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always interesting when people have
that point of view.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, when people come in and ask what my
problem is with joint breath, this is it
[SPEAKER_03]: all summed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is just about as offensive as you can
get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so I was looking up some shit and
I noticed there's a story about this dude
[SPEAKER_03]: in Kauai.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's his name?
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin Britt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, he got sued for embezzling and
that happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pieces of shit embezzle and steal from
each other and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch of noobs trying to get into the
fucking medical cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a better shot of the guy right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that Keanu Reeves?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know who it is?
[SPEAKER_03]: This dude's brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: This dude's brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only reason I don't feel bad about
this is because this dumbass decided to
[SPEAKER_03]: put his real name up on high times.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Supa Kauai, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Supa here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, people also want to know what the deal
is on Supa Kauai.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, he showed up, I don't know,
five years ago maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Claiming that his dad made Krippi or
someone made Krippi.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But saying his dad went to jail,
did all the time, that his dad's a fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no!
[SPEAKER_03]: No, your dad did not go to jail,
did he, buddy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, it's just, he needs to know that,
I mean, just because we don't unload on a
[SPEAKER_03]: dude, we don't really unload on nobody's,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: But at least now he knows, now he knows
that we know and he needs to shut his
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking mouth or shut him down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, anyway, I thought that was cute.
[SPEAKER_03]: This fucking ugly ass head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking meth is a fucked up drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't forget his dancing moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is purely for science,
but I want you to see something here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see those little things moving?
[SPEAKER_03]: He said that fucking roots are moving to
Bob Marley.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, any fucking way.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you guys up to?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no one got busted in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Supa's never done time.
[SPEAKER_03]: His dad's never done time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, doing time doesn't make someone
special to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't, you know, I mean, people get
popped every now and then.
[SPEAKER_03]: That happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a shame.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he uses it as like a flex,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's always weird when people,
that's not what happened and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: flexing with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, yeah, street cred stories
and it's just not gonna happen,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no street cred for you,
Supa.
[SPEAKER_03]: No street cred for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, yeah, I just thought that shit was
funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I unloaded on Mass Medical the
other day, so I figured I'd unload on his
[SPEAKER_03]: stupid ass, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, what you guys got?
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of stuff we got today?
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of questions you got?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what seeds can I pop with some old
Stella Blue flavor?
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a Blue Babyshit version,
too, that is essentially that Stella Blue,
[SPEAKER_03]: the same fucking turp profile as the
Stella Blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the guy behind 808.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He told me, what was he saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's never heard of me before and then he
called me a fat methadone something
[SPEAKER_03]: rather.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I clack.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, a lot of people tell on
themselves and that's how they get caught.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to brag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those who don't, don't get caught.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wanna give me a BJ tonight?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, babe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The restaurant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course I'll take a BJ.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you mean the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a woman.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a woman.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not feeling good and still gonna go now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Breeder Steve is on Future Cannabis
Project now live.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you get them or do you have the Blue
Babyshit version, too?
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know you're a Stella Blue fan,
so yeah, hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bazooka.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they have bazookas there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want fucking bazooka.
[SPEAKER_03]: BJ's is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy Wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: The opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely true, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see what else I got.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I have some other prized things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some I cannot show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some I cannot show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could show you all this shit that
I got on this dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not big on doxing, folks, but when
someone puts their first and last name in
[SPEAKER_03]: a high times ad, they kind of just are,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not very smart, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: BJ tastes like BJ's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Extra yummy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Die of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, what else have we got in here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, please do, Stella.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drop it to me here on Riot Seedco.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never checked the other ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a Blue Babyshit version one,
which was the, it was a Stella Blue BX.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have the Blue Babyshit version
two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that one, it's not, it has no Stella
Blue in it, but it is based on that type
[SPEAKER_03]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Genetic drift is a myth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think acclimation is real.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as something drifting genetically,
there's such thing as epigenetics that
[SPEAKER_03]: affect stuff, but nothing is ever gonna
drift genetically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't, it just doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Genetics don't drift like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Acclimation's a real thing, which is why
you can see the Chem 91 cut fucking blown
[SPEAKER_03]: out, fucking, or really beautiful looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few different ways to grow that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with the puck and other cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what else funny shit we got.
[SPEAKER_03]: What other questions you guys got?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Clack in here so we can actually
ask soil question, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, I don't ever answer soil
questions because I'm not a soil guy,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it'd be nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else do we got?
[SPEAKER_03]: Been seeing some pretty pictures from my
buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The P. Can you explain the Uncle Fester
cut?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no Uncle Fester cut for real.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a myth by a nature fraud,
nature farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: That started back with, what's his name?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a headache right now, so I'm trying
to think.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, what's his fucking name?
[SPEAKER_03]: The dude who said he made Tahoe,
that fucking idiot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Master Tai.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the one that started all that shit
about like, oh, it's skunk 18.6 or 18.8.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was a liar too.
[SPEAKER_03]: He never made Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's just one liar after another
trying to build up on shit they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really people bragging about skunk
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunk 18.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is an original skunk 18,
but it is, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's not ever been something in
circulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't know on that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't talked to him about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, you know, I don't like to say
someone doesn't have something absolute.
[SPEAKER_03]: If, if, if I don't know for sure,
if you could add one amendment to your
[SPEAKER_03]: soil, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clack.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're still in here, if you could add
one amendment to your soil, what would it
[SPEAKER_03]: be?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not heard of ginseng OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's new to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?
Is
[SPEAKER_03]: there a particular strain that changed my
life financially?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have to give all credit to Oregon
kid and the banana OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as financially, the clockwork
orange, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kelp mill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kelp mill.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your answer from clack.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's very experienced with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd say that's pretty good advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, clockwork and in banana OG,
like a banana OG helped me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that I used a lot and it
did really well for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't take any credit for the banana OG
stuff that really was someone else's
[SPEAKER_03]: doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was already good when it got to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I've been having trouble though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we, I can't tell if this is male or
not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you guys can help me figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been trying to sex this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kelp meal, not seaweed extract black
powder.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been trying to sex this for a few
days and I just can't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else do we got here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to all heart for that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, too good, too good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fully erect without ready to blow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's that fucking pee picture that I
had?
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the P91S1 for bitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: His selection of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lay down, lay down Murray.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely not cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are me and coma still good?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I have no reason to be shit
talking coma at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just disagree on some things,
but nothing bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another person asking about create.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever seen the dude in his tooth?
[SPEAKER_03]: His one tooth?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was all you know what I was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Mr. Vitus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Nathan here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Create.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if, if you like, um, a little side
of meth with your seeds create would be
[SPEAKER_03]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I know of any crosses made with a hawk?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a black pack is doing
something with a walk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if some sort, I know bony's done some,
uh, well Hawken crosses, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, blueberry has well Hawken in it
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: See keeping on and on knows what's up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's up roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thoughts on boneyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like boneyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like them a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Tony quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he's, he's one of the few people,
uh, like all heart that always inspires me
[SPEAKER_03]: to be a better person.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he's been through a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, lost one of his legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's a beast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Art is a beast.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but Tony, he's a, he's a special dude
and he keeps fighting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does honest genetics live up to his name,
dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have to put honest in front of your
name, you're trying to sell something that
[SPEAKER_03]: you aren't.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I got to say with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Hawken Spears circa 76.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I'd love to see some nice while
Hawken nowadays.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm too young to have known while Hawken
never knew Hindu Kush was actually an area
[SPEAKER_03]: until last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Hindu Kush mountain region.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not in range.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mextiza.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a, um, a Mexa milia.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot who did that one, but it was
really good too.
[SPEAKER_03]: What form of silicon can be added to soil
without jacking up pH and does it need it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I don't know about amending,
uh, with silica, but I like the
[SPEAKER_03]: orthosilic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it doesn't jack the pH too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the RKS from blue sky guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Lord.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, dude, you know, I mean some people
are new to this and whatnot, but you have
[SPEAKER_03]: got to be just a little bit suspicious of
that dude when nobody's grown it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's seen it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the only one pumping it is him on 90
different names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, it's that dude is something
else, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another guy that's lying about shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I actually put up, uh, screenshots of
what, um, old timer one, said about his
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk line, his skunk one line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what this dickhead keeps saying
is his RKS.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I mean, old timer one
himself said that it was not skunky.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, ever since then he's been,
um, writing my dick pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can Clackamas breakdown add sil 16 versus
some hype like aptus or power SI.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Axel versus Axel 16 versus like power SI.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, man, I want to say I used the Axel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have any results like I did with
the power SI, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tropic trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you tell you can't, what are you
tagging super quiet for?
[SPEAKER_03]: We already, we already done been over that
little bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and I don't know if he ever says he
has pop, but just in case, no,
[SPEAKER_03]: you ain't ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking been, been popped.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just in case he tries to ever pull that
one, we already know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear the GGG interview?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't give a fuck what GGG says.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking flat earth or anti-vaxxer fucking
idiots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your neighbor's children.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, I've hope you don't have like an
idiot like we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a pre-sam cal.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no such thing as a pre-sam
California skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when you're depends on what,
let me rephrase that there's no such thing
[SPEAKER_03]: as a pre-sam California skunk one that
doesn't exist before Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, skunky weed did exist before Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was just Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had nothing to do with skunk one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, yeah, clap.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to come on?
[SPEAKER_03]: She had, I'll bring them on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: See if it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get this picture off here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll probably mess up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring super.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would never bring super in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't give super quiet exposure.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Answer that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes up all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost every so-called liquid silica
product is made from potassium silicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where your pH issues come into
play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, problems with raising the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, we, we can get it from other
sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, a couple of the posters here
mentioned, uh, rice hulls and that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's even a powdered rice hull product
that build a soil carries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember the name, but I've used
it and it did well.
[SPEAKER_01]: One person asked a very legitimate
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it even necessary?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in my worm bins, I run a lot of,
uh, rice hulls.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called as an aeration material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when that deconstruct is releasing the,
uh, silica oxide, it's, I believe that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the form it's in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would I add it to my soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, so that question isn't,
you need some silica in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, if you use it judiciously and get
like the, uh, Ag-sil product, because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what all the other ones,
like the silly one from, Oh, the guy
[SPEAKER_01]: advanced nutrients, wet Betty or some
silly name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, even a silly or a label, but,
uh, it's made from Ag-sil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all those products that you see in
the growth store or what I call the house
[SPEAKER_01]: of prediction, um, they're all made with
eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get Ag-sil and then cut to chase and
it's in a powder form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can mix on an as need basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and it's good for emulsifying,
horticultural oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get into that mess,
uh, Neem or Caronga or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still use them and they're full of
crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people, you know, you gotta,
you gotta learn the difference between an
[SPEAKER_01]: extract and a pressing, but, you know,
that's like trying to explain why is it
[SPEAKER_01]: called unsulphured and not desulphured
molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can't wrap your brain around
that one, then I don't want to talk to you
[SPEAKER_01]: about the differences between an
extraction and using solvents and a
[SPEAKER_01]: pressing that goes back at least a
thousand years to, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get off myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about, uh, how do you feel
about, um, like, like PowerSI,
[SPEAKER_03]: the orthosalicylic acids and, and,
and monosalicylic acids?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me turn my sound up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, how do you feel about orthosalicylic
acid and monosalicylic acid stuff that's
[SPEAKER_03]: not from potassium silicate?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to be honest with you,
I'm a real minimalist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you looked at my recipe,
uh, the biggest criticism is, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no there there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's all in the worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't look, I think everybody
should recycle their kitchen waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't do that, you should have to
be forced to listen to some TV show that's
[SPEAKER_01]: really horrible or something, but it's not
going to give you a worm cast.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's too much water and it's magical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those worms are, they can't turn water
into castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need bulk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that comes from either aged manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by that we mean five to six weeks to
allow the, um, vermicides that are given
[SPEAKER_01]: livestock for, you know, like we do dogs,
you worm them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, those vermicides kill the good guys
in our worm bins.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to let that sit for about five to
six weeks and they'll degrade into a form,
[SPEAKER_01]: into a basic, uh, ionic structure,
if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's no longer a vermicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's carbon and hydrogen and oxygen and
all those good things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, so we want to use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives us bulk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how you make good castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's through bulking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they have the stuff that had,
there's some,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, good, good, uh, good, uh, bedding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been, uh, elevated with, uh,
nutrient dense materials like small
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of alfalfa meal, uh, kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to run neem and caranja.
[SPEAKER_01]: This might, you might find interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caranja is actually a legume.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's closer to a, uh, alfalfa plant than
it is the neem tree, which is a mahogany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the properties in those two materials
couldn't be more different.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no shared constituents as a
direction comes from, uh, neem and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, pangamia oil comes from caranja.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not familiar with caranja.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what, what is that used for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in India is the preferred one for
medicines for, uh, uh, skin products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and India has some of its own race
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the beliefs that lighter colored
citizens are more intelligent than
[SPEAKER_01]: darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's said to be used to lighten the skin
tone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that it can, uh, but if you,
if you went into an Indian market and went
[SPEAKER_01]: to the Habas section, everything would
have either neem or caranja in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, shampoo, toothpaste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but over here, if you get touched with
neem, you're going to fall over dead or
[SPEAKER_01]: something, or, you know, you can't go to
the Rose parade or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, yeah, I mean, uh, means if you
look at the Ayurvedic medical system,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you have the TCM traditional
Chinese and India has the Ayurvedic and
[SPEAKER_01]: 72% of the, uh, uh, bottled compounds,
you know, um, elixirs and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: 72% have some part of the neem tree root
bark leaf oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's behind the Tulsi basil,
which is a forerunner of all basils,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the wolf is to the, or canine
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this one, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most holy plant in India is the
Tulsi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then neem is the second one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't know that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look up for some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nearesearch.ca.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's nothing to do with gardening,
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about human health, uh,
diabetes, uh, uh, viruses, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can rub the oil on your feet as a cure
or a prevention of athlete's sweat.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do a lot of, uh, running or,
you know, so yeah, it's been around for
[SPEAKER_01]: 5,000 years, but suddenly 18 months ago
became a, you know, point of discussion
[SPEAKER_01]: at, uh, Canna con and, uh, endo expo,
you know, it's just silly, you know,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, all this is appreciated.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's people asking all kinds of
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no worries, no worries.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, let's see, why my, why is my worm
casting running hot in sodium?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, uh, and you think I can push out
sodium with calcium gypsum?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, cause gypsum is simply, uh,
um, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, calcium sulfate and it's calcium in
its elemental form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the calcium we get in say
limestone or, uh, oyster shell,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's calcium, uh, calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's one, uh, calcium ion.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one carbon ion and then three
oxygen ions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And calcium carbonate, but in this,
in gypsum, you're getting calcium by
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get sulfur oxide,
which is water soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what, and like, let's say you're
using core, uh, one thing that has to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, acknowledged is that it's an
inert medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's preferred if you're going
to use salts, but in a, uh, or organic
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, it's a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you want to do, the big one that
it's missing is sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without sulfur, sulfur is at the base
of almost every metabolical function on
[SPEAKER_01]: this planet, including the production of
terpenes, terpenoids and ketones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be a really good, I've never read,
I'm using corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get any flavor and I don't get any
aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a half a cup of, uh, gypsum,
you know, and say a cubic foot and there
[SPEAKER_01]: you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're dancing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something I had to learn on my own
too, to add, add sulfur, uh, some kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: sulfur to, to, because I use core.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like a mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to add in a calcium carbonate like
limestone or oyster show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a little bit of gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm getting my elemental calcium along
with my calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm also picking up, uh,
some gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's, that's a good balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, I don't like using this term,
but a liming agent, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For lack of better one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a request here on, um,
the history of the strain, the one,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is one I've been fascinated with for
a long time myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in Laguna beach in the late sixties
and early seventies before the whole LSD
[SPEAKER_01]: orange sunshine thing took them apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one thing to taunt a dog behind the
fence with a stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't want to do that with the
federal government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's especially when you're in
containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Containers of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are like 48,000, you know,
I mean, these guys weren't just the dude
[SPEAKER_01]: that we had to see the dude and get some
stashed it tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this was like, you know,
you got like even then 10 kilos to even
[SPEAKER_01]: communicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, so the seeds came and a lot of
the guys, cause they're in the BOL.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was like, it had to be 13,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: 13 original founding members.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a given.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so seven were a part of this ragtag
motorcycle club that used to hang out this
[SPEAKER_01]: really weird bar and not far for
Disneyland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and they were just, you know,
drinkers and you know, like rowdy bikers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the sixties, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was also this group of surfers.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the mid sixties that were traveling
around the world as it was easy to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe easier than today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they went surfing and the surfing
spots all had somebody there with good
[SPEAKER_01]: weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they started bringing some good weed
back because they knew how to pass their
[SPEAKER_01]: boards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can make a hole in the board and
stash in a pound or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's then the two got together
and then the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the seed that I had were from Kandahar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I went off to the army and got
drafted, you know, kicking in screaming to
[SPEAKER_01]: send the women and children first,
um, but off to save the world and make it
[SPEAKER_01]: safer democracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I came back in, uh, in December of
1976, the first tie sticks came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they came in, uh, 10 kilo bales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and they were wrapped in, uh,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 kilo 22 pounds, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, 20 of those pounds were sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since EMEA was still two or three
years away, so they were seedy is all get
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, there was then two pounds of
loose buds that of course had to be
[SPEAKER_01]: renamed the Buddha buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those seeds became the first crop I
ever did that summer in 77.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was no grow stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no new program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even, not even sure even would
know what to do if I had a bottle of maxi
[SPEAKER_01]: or miracle grow or whatever, you know,
but I understood that you had to water
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that was before the banking laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could walk into a car dealer and buy
four Celicas if you want and pay cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was no big deal later in the Reagan
administration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, just say no, that crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, so that was a female and there
were 10 plants that were selected out of
[SPEAKER_01]: this mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm not a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I told you, you guys would be
laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was like flying by the seat of my
pants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be real honest about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's early on though.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one was really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there were no seed companies and the
guys in California were still thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: around with goofy names, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I had a couple, but I wouldn't name.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that one, uh, the way it got the
name was that they were all against the
[SPEAKER_01]: wall and they went from sativa over to
Afghani dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no interest in at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just said, okay, the one over here is
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, oh, so it's like the one,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's like the one over here is mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then it became a running joke,
you know, he still got the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's still got the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so that's just like, you know,
it has nothing to do with, I thought it
[SPEAKER_01]: was like, oh yeah, it's like the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've had the one that came from Sri
Lanka and I didn't want to ever smoke weed
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like that far out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was like some Hindus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, real Hindu, not, you know,
you picked it up in New Delhi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like in the Cush Valley or
something, you know, from the Saudi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all the, you know, no big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, but ironic is that I've given
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never sold a cone in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last time I sold a seed was 77.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's early.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take Thai seeds, you know, cause I had
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I learned early on that if I was
going to take the risk of being a serious
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer of cannabis, that you might as
well do the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would sell like, I know you're saying
I'm lying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, but say I would get fronted like
a ton or two of, uh, Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: From guys in, uh, Detroit with way too
many valves in their last name.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd give you like two months to turn
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our motto was, I don't want to own it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to fingerprint it,
meaning, you know, bump it 25,
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just keep it, you know, so then I
would turn around and go buy like premium
[SPEAKER_01]: Mishma Khan or O'Hawkins Spears for
personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you went to Sears and got a,
uh, deep freezer so I could freeze it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so I could buy a three or four
pounds, you know, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, and I, you know, can I just
say one thing about skunk number one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, going back to the like original in
the mid eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as like why it's called skunk in
the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, I just don't get the
whole thing about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, why like it's that desirable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I understand that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, I can understand that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite lines is somebody will
give me a bud to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it says, so did you clone this more
than twice?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's made it through three rounds,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, one nice thing about growing an old
strain is that you really can test the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil because you can't test the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this time I'm going to do,
I don't know, skittles or pittles or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it's called.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you over here, well, I'm going to
try this or, but I'm going to use,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookies or whatever the thing is,
you know, whatever the hot button is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with me, I mean, I can tell you by day
24, uh, I'm not going to finish this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you let me try it,
but you know, best wishes go back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: drawing board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, and so in my opinion,
which means nothing is that at least if I
[SPEAKER_01]: test something for you, I can give you an
accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comparison analysis of one, uh,
that I've, you know, grown like forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main reason people don't like mine is
that if you really want to get the full,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, twilight zone team comes on
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you got to do at least 12,
if not 14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the best part.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the part I love the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taken it 18 weeks just to see what it
would take to get the trikes to turn even
[SPEAKER_01]: cloudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't ever happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're never going to get the Amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let alone cloudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it never goes cloudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even outdoors, like seven months where you
like Southern California, where you can
[SPEAKER_01]: take it through November into December.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never, no, it never goes cloudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has to be the Highland tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if you try it like way less light
hours, like six hours light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done every, even when I was ignorant,
got into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, you need this bulb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: This bulb will make it finish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This bulb will make it finish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need this magic stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's in, I can't tell you it's
proprietary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, that's, that's my,
you know, just a guy that decided to get
[SPEAKER_01]: into soil real serious and figure out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have posted on my IG feed of a soil test
that I mixed five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has all the NPK, it has all the
macro and micro nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we're a little weak in the
micro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw some kelp in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why kelp is the perfect one because
it's a plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it accumulates all 83 elements,
more importantly in the right balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we don't go nuts, that's adding some
kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take care of all our micro nutrient
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only brown, not blue green algae,
not red, but a green, I mean green and
[SPEAKER_01]: red, but brown only brown is the only
organism on this planet that creates
[SPEAKER_01]: algenic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll leave you for research on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see why brown kelp has algenic
acid seaweed extract is created by by law
[SPEAKER_01]: under federal USDA regulations has to be
created with either sodium, hydroxide or
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium hydroxide, the stuff they use in
Drano to clean out your drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they use that and they burn everything
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are you left with?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're left with power.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got your elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might as well just do salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the life force is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a convenience that is detrimental to
your soil, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to put a fungicide in my soil
after I've spent several months building
[SPEAKER_01]: up the nutrient and fungal profile in my
compost before I ever hit a warm bin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I ask you, are you self-researched and
you just delved into it hardcore and
[SPEAKER_03]: learned it all on your own or are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm academically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say this is pretty heavy
academic stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the real stuff is that you have to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to get your hands on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no bottle solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it's hard work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to have scratch in the
game.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to do it and be consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be my fault because we released my
product today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one with the malted barley,
malted heirloom corn and hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And where can people get this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, build a soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I named it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to sound cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gnarly barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gnarly barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50% barley and it's 30% corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for the cytokinins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the hemp, which I could spend a
couple of days explaining all the enzymes
[SPEAKER_01]: and compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, from it kind of goes like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it works good on a plant, it's probably
good for you and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The benefits from the hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: All malting means nothing more than this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that you took a seed and you
germinated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you arrest it at about 116
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that does, it leaves the enzymes
intact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we call that diastatic malt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if we take that malt after it's dried
and ready to store or use, and we
[SPEAKER_01]: caramelize it for flavor or aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: For ales and what have you, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it kills all the enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we call that non-diastatic malt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you use non-diastatic malt in your
beer formula, then you need to add the
[SPEAKER_01]: diastatic malt because you can't make beer
without amylase as the main player enzyme
[SPEAKER_01]: in the barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not what we benefit from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I explain this?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all plants produce chitinase and chitin
itself is an acetyl form of glucosamine.
[SPEAKER_01]: All seashells contain, are made up from
limestone or calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the crustaceans, the crab,
the lobster, the shrimp, and I guess that
[SPEAKER_01]: would also include the one in the south,
crawdads, have chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And chitin, for example, if you had
surgery, either oral or external,
[SPEAKER_01]: they probably sewed you up with chitin
string.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes back to like the 1880s.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has really got an interesting
connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 1922, this young man by the name of
Albert Hoffman graduates from Cologne
[SPEAKER_01]: University and his paper is on the
molecular structure of chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 21 years later, he would
introduce or find LSD25.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 15 years after that, he was
commissioned to do the research on these
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms out of Oaxaca.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's the one that gave the name to the
two compounds psilocybin and psilocin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a 15 year period, here he does
LSD25.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read his book, LSD, My Problem Child.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Write it down, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then anyway, so the only thing that
can deconstruct microbally, that can
[SPEAKER_01]: deconstruct a polysaccharide is fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bacteria, in their weak attempt to try to
deconstruct it, create an enzyme called
[SPEAKER_01]: chitinase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And chitinase deconstructs eggshells in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to use a poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then equally important, animal kingdom
and plant kingdom have immune systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in plants, you have like HAR,
hormonal acquired resistance and SAR,
[SPEAKER_01]: systemic acquired resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them are called pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most important pathway in a plant's
defense system is the chitinase
[SPEAKER_01]: salicylate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Salicylic acid pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every plant produces salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants produce copious amounts like
aloe vera plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've probably heard in your career,
oh, you can use willow shoots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, that's salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, and so that's why people would use
aloe vera.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it started that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, look, man, I'm not climbing a
tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go to a Mexican market and get a
fresh aloe vera leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just cut off the spiny stuff on
the sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you stick your stems in there inside
the gel, let it sit overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next day, put them in however you,
I don't want to get into that one,
[SPEAKER_01]: but however you do your cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that salicylic acid creates a barrier
against pathogenic fungi, your molds and
[SPEAKER_01]: all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I average seriously overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think they're going to have to
be treated properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a good thing.
I mean, I'm a plant specialist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a prostitute.
I don't think I can go to a doctor or a
doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I can go to a chemist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I can go to a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I can go to a dentist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I can go to a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm not going to the doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would probably go to a dentist.
[SPEAKER_01]: till it gets in that jar with the little
bear, you know, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sad story, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like the real deal, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, so that's why if we use malted
grains in our soil, the chitinase,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have to go through the expense
of using crab meal, because what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: really after is the chitinase,
not the chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here you get it right in the malted
grains along with UREs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urea, protase, protein, phosphatase,
what cannabis grower doesn't obsess about
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much to their peril usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you get the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so there's like 360 enzymes in a
malted grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I can do and have done is I can
document, OK, here are the enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take something out from under your
fingernail and put it in water and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can explain each one and how they
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm only taking like 10 out of the 360
that are in barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and then you add corn to the
cytokinins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that does to between the tip of
the root system and then the meristem at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the branches is quite a
phenomenal study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first cytokinin was discovered in
corn in 1937 and the Latin name for corn
[SPEAKER_01]: is Zia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they named this enzyme Ziatine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's and there's other there's other
PGRs and other things in the corn besides.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one enzyme, excuse me, a hormone.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just thinking Botany 101.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably bored your audience there,
but no, no, I think everybody's fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: loving it, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to have you on any time you are
bored, want to come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's a real treat for me and
everyone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really appreciate it because I like
talking to gardeners instead of salesmen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure and an honor to have you
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at my feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your what?
[SPEAKER_01]: My feed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, yeah, I see some of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that one, a 10 and a half pounder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you think it's a little disingenuous
to come on my feed and tell me what I
[SPEAKER_01]: should be doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my good Lord.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's everybody's a scholar.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I want to say is maybe like do
more reading and not so much editorial
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, you know, till you kind of I
figured I've been involved in at least
[SPEAKER_01]: 300, 325 serious gardens in my career.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I imagine so, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first lightsaber I bought was from
George.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, it was called George Avantis
then before he became Jorge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A place here in Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of three growth stores in
Portland at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went and bought these Dutch lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from PL Light Systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I mean, the professional stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to burn down my house in
Orange County, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, trying to grow some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decide there was, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Funding was available, I'll leave it at
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, we decided to set it up first
cabin and I was using what do you call
[SPEAKER_01]: them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Dosatron's 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And buying like full jugs, I think there
were five gallons, you know, Dynagro and
[SPEAKER_01]: Dyna Bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd write down to there was some in the
Bay Area like San Jose, something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we just put the Dosatron inside the
jugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I did the strip system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, by today's standards, you guys got
it made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's all off the shelf and play
for the most part, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to kind of like, huh, so how are we
going to do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the best one time, pulling stuff out
of the field and staging it next to the
[SPEAKER_01]: pickup trucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy that was like our leader,
I called him OPH, our personal hero.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, I just said,
hey, Thumbdick, have you given a thought
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're going to drive this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody just looks down at the
ground like, oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were using bull tacos to go back
into the forest to get the plants where
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm bringing them back and stage them,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jorge Cervantes, I know he's friends
with some of the Northern Lights crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you interact with those guys at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not at all, because that came out of
what they called the BCGA, the British
[SPEAKER_01]: Columbia Growers Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the NL came out of Canada on a guy
that broke, BCGA wasn't going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: business with any of the two groups that
came out of Holland, what is now called
[SPEAKER_01]: Sensei Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it was called the SSSC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Neville and his partner,
David Watson.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they wandered around and everybody had
cash, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: A briefcase is full of cash and they were
buying seeds and cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Northern Light came out from a
grower in Canada that said, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, you know, you cut hay when the sun
shines.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got money?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how the NL thing went over to
Neville's deal, the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the only thing I ever bought
seeds in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought them one time, Hay's Northern
Lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you find any keepers in it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you find good stuff in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I never bought another seed again in my
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, every story I hear about older
growers that were growing the Northern
[SPEAKER_03]: Lights, Hay's, and a Tay Day, they all
have very, very fond memories.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they talk about how many keepers were
found that became like well-known
[SPEAKER_03]: clone-onlys that are still around
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there is a caveat to my comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make this is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's where you're getting conflicting
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a case that I was indirectly,
I wasn't involved, but I was on the
[SPEAKER_01]: possible list of come talk to us back in
Boston.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in discovery, it came out that the DEA
and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Postal Service was intercepting letters
from the seed banks to customers here and
[SPEAKER_01]: they were switching it out with ditch weed
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was in discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what they came to the,
you know, here's our evidence,
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence, whatever they call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not an attorney, but they all sit
around before they do lunch or something
[SPEAKER_01]: and you decide how they're going to screw
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I mean, that just like it
clicked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But have you ever noticed how many times
in your life you've been back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: foreign day before to social media?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like icy mag or grass and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People go, well, my plants sure don't look
like the pictures from the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just used to think, I don't even
want to open this can of worms,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I'll be hated on forever for
spilling that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going to realize their
collection's worthless and then they're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to really dislike the messenger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but no, that's honest to God.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I just went, well,
that party's over, you know, so let's go
[SPEAKER_01]: back to square one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we know, because we
know who brought them into the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States and the whole history and who had
possession of them and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have a lot of confidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: One greeter here, a farmer, whatever they
call him, gave me 13 samples in those
[SPEAKER_01]: little jars with, you know, probably a
whole, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half a gram, or half an ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorilla glue, Girl Scout cookies,
this, that, this, that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put them in a bag and I brought them
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were going to hire me as a
consultant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my wife's in the kitchen cooking
dinner and I sat down in the living room
[SPEAKER_01]: and I opened one up and I smelled it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went, God, that's really terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, you never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I pulled out a noug and I busted it up
and I put it in my pipe and I got half a
[SPEAKER_01]: hit and I just put it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife comes around the corner and she
goes, what's that smell?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, oh, it's, and I don't want to
name it because I'll get, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's one that everybody has to have
where you're just a complete dickhead,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not growing this one,
you're a dickhead.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just said, and so I, you know,
I was really polite, but I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I called the next day and said,
I just don't see any connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like redo your soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's just more issues here than
I can even, I need like the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: spreadsheet known to God to even get into
the science of why this thing's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish you the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, one season was over.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first year it went legal here
and there was funny money everywhere from
[SPEAKER_01]: Asian banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: From European banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who did they hire?
[SPEAKER_01]: A grow store clerk?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your grow guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you need another CalMag lockout to
handle this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no, there's no purpose in
consulting for someone that's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: hire idiots all along the side of you to
perform, you know, complex shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm, and I'm enough of an egotist and
a clown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't tolerate fools lightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hey, go do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish you the best, you know,
instant karma, whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: yada, yada, yada.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm here to grow real medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not here to grow grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole hemp industry is like that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had just made my, my entrance into the
hemp industry last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was shocked at how many people are
playing grower in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really thought, I never fucked with it
because I figured there are people that
[SPEAKER_03]: are, that are better than I would be at
doing it because they've been studying
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically hemp longer and working with
it longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured they had that shit fucking
dialed in and boy was I confused when I
[SPEAKER_03]: got in there and saw the people were just
playing, constantly playing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I know is that I know how to grow
plants without cartwheels and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, proprietary this, and I can't
tell you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I mean, you think,
look, think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issues facing the human race isn't
whether Johnny gets his dank on,
[SPEAKER_01]: is how are we going to feed people?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if this crap worked, they'd be sitting
in front of the UN, picking up checks for
[SPEAKER_01]: billions of dollars on solving world
hunger, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to me, it's that simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why like on my new product,
I'm donating a percent of my compensation
[SPEAKER_01]: to an agency that plants forests around
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think, you know, I just think,
hey, I want everybody to get their dank on
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if some like newt line, I want to do a
line called Coots Newts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just look at it and say,
look, this is what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeding your deal, man, your Dharma,
whatever it is you think you have to do to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Instagram shut me down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Goodbye, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my honor to have you on and I'd love
to have you on again anytime, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Goodbye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Fred.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a treat that was.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's so smart.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to go rewatch that
several times.
[SPEAKER_03]: If any of you can play that and record it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason I can't do it myself is
because I get a lot of messages and
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll pop up in the recording.
[SPEAKER_03]: If any of you can record that and at least
get me somehow get me the video,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it's your email or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will put it up on YouTube because I
think that one's a very important one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for everyone stopping in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks again to Coots.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was our first conversation that we've
had.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it was a privilege and an honor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a happy Friday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look super.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Fred.
Thank you.
