[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasabi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: How goes it?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so everyone coming in,
the Northern Lights Five stock is up on
[SPEAKER_00]: the site for the Patreon members.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a Patreon member for
Breeder's Syndicate, you can go buy them
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, they're up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you grabbed them already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so it's on RiotSeatCo.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are part of the Patreon,
you can buy the NL5 in the backstage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we can talk about more important
shit like history, like like what are we
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk about, Natsuo?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, tonight might be a range of
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we can talk a little bit about
NLs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and, you know, how things survive from
now to then.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we could talk about,
you know, we were thinking that we
[SPEAKER_05]: actually opened it up to some suggestions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was some things about some
strains that got away.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was actually some pretty good
questions that came in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to try to tackle some of
those, you know, as you know, throughout
[SPEAKER_05]: throughout the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you know, one thing that maybe I
should start with is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we chatted about some chem history,
some Chem 101 and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, whenever you whenever you
tackle like sort of a big and famous weed
[SPEAKER_05]: history segment, right, you're going to
get a lot of debate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like master debaters, you know,
and you want different people to be able
[SPEAKER_05]: to contribute and you want people to come
up and say things.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then you're always going to get people
that are that are going to pick apart one
[SPEAKER_05]: section that they feel is incorrect or
what often happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And CSI and I were actually talking about
this last night is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: on some level, when you want to figure out
the history, it's like which semi
[SPEAKER_05]: untrustworthy person do you lean more
towards?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's there's an aspect of that
where it's like it's very difficult to
[SPEAKER_05]: have a situation where you feel like one
person is totally angelic and honest and
[SPEAKER_05]: every facet and this is how it is and
there's not debate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, debate is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this guy just said he met Don
the Indian recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been dead for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but, you know, that there's an aspect
to it where it was like you anytime
[SPEAKER_05]: there's anybody famous or even semi
famous, especially if it's hard to like
[SPEAKER_05]: determine who they are, you're always
going to get there's not just fake cuts,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's fake people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second DJ short.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, yeah, there's there's,
you know, in any kind of famous lineage,
[SPEAKER_05]: there'll be like an accepted story and
there's one or two guys in the corner
[SPEAKER_05]: screaming that it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it all came from me or whoever,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what you try to do is you try to
like you try to like corroborate
[SPEAKER_05]: information from different people and you
try to see, you know, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's there was an aspect to it,
too, because one of the aspects about chem
[SPEAKER_05]: fam, for instance, is that, you know,
a lot of the most outspoken people when it
[SPEAKER_05]: comes to chem story didn't have all that
that much to do with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and then so you get some people
out of the woodwork and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_05]: and you get and, you know, and you try to
tell a story.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, there's there's parts and
people are going to remember things
[SPEAKER_05]: differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not really the that's not
really the the that's not really an issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's all about like that's what
science, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Science is right until it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it adjusts itself to the new
reality.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like when you're doing history,
it's not so much that you're wrong or
[SPEAKER_05]: you're lying.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you get a part mistaken, it's that you
might need more nuance.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you might have there might be some
stuff that you don't say because you think
[SPEAKER_05]: it's too out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not corroborated enough, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and, you know, and how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so like part of the part of the thing
we're trying to do with with most of this
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff is that we actually don't have a
personal tie to any kind of like big
[SPEAKER_05]: profit motive behind it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't have some like secret
chem line that's all about to be released
[SPEAKER_05]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's an aspect of history for
history's sake.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, history is most in cannabis
right now, especially it's mostly oral.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's not written down.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's held by different people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They often disagree.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were often young when the history was
being made and they often didn't know it
[SPEAKER_05]: was history.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's a bunch of people out there
that were doing what all the famous kids
[SPEAKER_05]: were doing back then that don't remember
what they did either.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it doesn't matter because nobody cares
to ask them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's been a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you know, and so and so,
you know, there's I just want everyone to
[SPEAKER_05]: know that like it's not like when we talk
about stuff, there's not it's it's not
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely doesn't have to be necessarily
definitive.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always open for debate.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're always open for new information and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes a lot of times what CSI and
Matt and I and others do is we try to
[SPEAKER_05]: match the story to what the plant tells
us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a story where it's like
plants don't lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, so I just wanted to get that
out there first because, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's Instagram and and that's part of
the reason why like these lives are cool
[SPEAKER_05]: is because Instagram is actually like a
really bad place to debate in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: The comments are super short, at least on
the forums.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could get out some paragraphs or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and you could have a little bit
more long form debate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Instagram is like a paragraph or less
of basically like, you know, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a dick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't match my money motive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that doesn't that doesn't match
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You must have some.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then most people think that you would
act like how they would act, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it it it you know, the other
part of it that's funny, too, is it's like
[SPEAKER_05]: you you have an aspect, too, where it's
like and Matt and I talk about this all
[SPEAKER_05]: the time, where the claims of what people
have doesn't matter what family you're
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: They get earlier and earlier until they're
they actually predate the story.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's common, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And almost every famous weed family.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It like it gets earlier and earlier and
people get access sooner and sooner until
[SPEAKER_05]: the generally the person that's generally
accepted to start it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's someone else that has it for five
years before that person.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: With.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and so I kind of think that kind
of stuff is tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so I just we're not going to
talk about that all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just thought I just wanted to throw it
out there in the sense that like we
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely are open for debate.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually kind of like these chats
are kind of like conversation starters.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and we're trying to get
information out there so that history gets
[SPEAKER_05]: debated.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and whatnot, you know,
so yeah, we call it pre pre that pre pre
[SPEAKER_05]: that pre pre and kind of the way cannabis
is, is because you don't get taught by
[SPEAKER_05]: your parents mostly or this or that you
come into cannabis when you come into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There can be stuff that's like extremely
common knowledge 10 years ago that becomes
[SPEAKER_05]: rare info today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so I mean, I just we don't need
to spend a ton of time on it, but but
[SPEAKER_05]: there is there's a bunch of that and you
can see it all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's blueberry before DJ had blueberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's blueberry from there's blueberry
from Alaska that has nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, you know, there's people that
have Kush way early.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, in different states,
there's people that can't.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's all and it's like, you don't want
to call people liars or mistaken.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in some cases, they might be lying.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in some cases, they might just be
telling a story that they were told.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in some cases, they have Hawaiian OG
and 70s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis folklore is a good way to put it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of folklore.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of legends.
[SPEAKER_05]: There might be kernels of truth to the
legends.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not even saying that everything
that I say is absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there could be aspects of it where
you're mistaken, you know, and we tried
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt and I to to like delineate like when
we went from what we think of as like
[SPEAKER_05]: actual fact to like now we're kind of like
making educated guesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Speculation versus speculations.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to get that out there
that this is definitely a sort of a venue
[SPEAKER_05]: to start debate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to try to get some facts to debate
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can you can reach out to either one
of us here on Discord or wherever if you
[SPEAKER_05]: want to keep it going or it sparks your
memory or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wanted to put that out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you don't ask about the Maui dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can talk about that super quick just
because Maui dog is supposedly a bag seed
[SPEAKER_05]: that came out of a bag of dog bud that was
bought in Sonoma County right around the
[SPEAKER_05]: turn of the century.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ninety nine two thousand ish.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they took it to Maui and they
creatively named the S1 or whatever it was
[SPEAKER_05]: that came out of that seed Maui dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also confusing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I made super dog crosses with this
other cut called the Maui.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those things got used and Mandelbrot's
work and other work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's also called, you know,
Maui super dog and other stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So but that's all it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a bag seed from supposed Chem 91
bought around ninety nine two thousand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they popped the seed on Maui and
then they crossed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone crossed that to some skunk on Maui
and that became the skunk dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was Molokai Frost was what
Grace Cole said.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like something along those
lines, you know, some kind of Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_05]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, you know, that's kind of that's
kind of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like there's other topics that we're
going to cover in the future that are
[SPEAKER_05]: probably going to create even more debate
than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I would think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's any time you get into a debate
about something where people have the real
[SPEAKER_05]: cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're selling seeds of this or they
have their reputation staked on anything,
[SPEAKER_05]: they only want to talk about stuff that
makes them look better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the rare person that wants to discuss
actual history.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people in cannabis history are
interested in like burnishing their own
[SPEAKER_05]: legend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're trying to do a little
something different where, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're not completely just polishing
ourselves the entire episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for for future reference, I don't have
any tie to chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I once said that earlier that I
was trying to burnish my reputation with
[SPEAKER_00]: chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any ties to chem.
[SPEAKER_05]: None.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk about a bunch of stuff
that we don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, my my personal tie to chem has
nothing to do with the creation of any of
[SPEAKER_05]: the famous cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just so happens I became best friends
with the guy that brought them west.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's really.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, so I ended up one of the
few by just by sheer chance long before it
[SPEAKER_05]: was famous.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so that's kind of that kind of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there are two Maui dogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, one of them is from my work.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Maui Superdog.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of them is a potentially a dog bag
seed crossed to some skunk in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think matchmakers also right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the dog and Maui dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one is Maui dog with one G,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the dog with two G's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it gets even more confused.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's very confusing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very confusing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe Maui dog was popped.
[SPEAKER_05]: They said they popped it when they got
back home.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it probably dates from 99 or 2000 or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the one thing I will actually say that
leads me to believe that the actual
[SPEAKER_05]: straight Maui dog could be an S1 of actual
chem dog is that, you know, I got to see a
[SPEAKER_05]: number of rooms run by our buddy CSI.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were all chem dog 91 S1s.
[SPEAKER_05]: And boy, does that Maui dog look like an
S1.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, is that proof without genetic
testing?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a dead boy does it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really you can see a bunch of things in
that room that looked very, very close to
[SPEAKER_05]: that cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, there's also a skunk dog someone
just posted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, skunk dog is a child of that cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the only and the other part of it
that may that may be true is that three
[SPEAKER_05]: out of the four people that I knew of at
the time that had a chem dog in California
[SPEAKER_05]: were growing it in the Sonoma area.
[SPEAKER_05]: I built all over myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was I was in Southern Mendo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Skunk VA was in was in Sonoma then our
buddy from Staten Island was in Sonoma
[SPEAKER_05]: then.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's it's I mean, it's possible you
could someone could have bought a bag,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the first one we want to cover?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to cover the mom techniques or
do you want to cover long lost strains?
[SPEAKER_05]: We could cover we could cover mom
techniques first.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably a little bit more concise
of a topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So mom techniques are, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's they've gotten a little bit more
complex in recent years, right,
[SPEAKER_05]: which we'll get to in a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically, the way I always did it was
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you want to start a new mom,
I would, you know, let's say you're going
[SPEAKER_05]: to let's say you're going to fill your
room with with a run and your mom is
[SPEAKER_05]: getting kind of old and tired.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you you veg up your room.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I would do is that I would pick
the healthiest, nicest, dankest looking
[SPEAKER_05]: vegetative plant in the entire room to be
my new mom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The one that hurts your heart to not put
in the bloom room because you wish that
[SPEAKER_05]: all of them in the bloom looked like that
one in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you always want to start with the
healthiest stock you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe in ag, it's called the cultivar
cut and moms and plants can get beat up
[SPEAKER_05]: and it can take months or a season or two
to get them back to health.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's always key to keep to keep moms
like to keep the best stock possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think the other thing that not
everyone gets to do, but I've gotten to do
[SPEAKER_05]: for the last couple of decades is and
Shanti does this too, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: cool, is that the sun goes a long way to
healing plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it's possible for you in your area
without being and getting in trouble or
[SPEAKER_05]: something to put your plant outside with
some artificial light in the nighttime in
[SPEAKER_05]: spring and early summer, and you give that
plant two or three months of growing
[SPEAKER_05]: outside or in a greenhouse and then you
take cuts off it and bring it back in.
[SPEAKER_05]: That cut will be a lot healthier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think some of that is mitigated
now because when that tech existed,
[SPEAKER_05]: there was kind of like two kinds of indoor
lights, metal halides and high pressure
[SPEAKER_05]: sodiums and both of them were pretty
limited compared to the sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, now we've got ceramic metal halides
and plasmas and a lot more things that you
[SPEAKER_05]: can get like a wider spectrum.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so I think that makes that makes
a big deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they've talked about it before,
but one of the ways like especially with
[SPEAKER_05]: all this dudding and stuff like that
that's been going on and viroids,
[SPEAKER_05]: people talk about outgrowing the viroid
where they try to take cuts off the
[SPEAKER_05]: growing tips.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because it maybe hasn't moved all
its way up to the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was kind of accepted tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now there's this wrinkle to it where
they actually say that there could be more
[SPEAKER_05]: genetic drift at the tips and the lowers
might have less mutations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who says that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who says that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I could show you some stuff after the
show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but it's been coming out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so now there's like a little bit of a
conflict of like, you know, less genetic
[SPEAKER_05]: mutations, perhaps, perhaps lower down on
the plant, but then more risk of disease
[SPEAKER_05]: if any exist in the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: But long term maintenance is hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keeping these these plants alive and
keeping them happy and healthy for a long
[SPEAKER_05]: time is tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the larger of a collection you get,
the harder it is to keep them all happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's that's for fucking sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because a lot of times needs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Matt can speak to this to somebody
like, you know, if you have a big
[SPEAKER_05]: collection and you're breeding all the
time, you might have 80 percent of your
[SPEAKER_05]: collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to stay in stasis,
but like you're kind of giving it low
[SPEAKER_05]: light and you're not trying to let it get
out of control or grow all crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then 20 percent of stuff you're going
to take cuts off of and use in various
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding projects, you're boosting under
better light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you boost everything under
better light, it's expensive and then
[SPEAKER_05]: everything grows way too fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you're hacking and slashing and
training and doing a bunch of work just to
[SPEAKER_05]: keep them, you know, they outgrow their
pots, they outgrow their happiness level.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so mom rotation is a big thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still a big fan of the the 10 by 20
tray full of pearl light in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking three foot tall clone moms.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been guilty of that one several
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just because it like like he's
talking about, it's a it's a real easy way
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep things growing as slow as possible
when you're doing it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes, yeah, keeping moms
doesn't necessarily mean you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: run all of that clone stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you're just throwing shit
out because you backed up 10 or 20.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you might only say, mom, you might
only need three or four plants,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you take 25 cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, I was talking to CSI
last night.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I mean, the amount of
backing up that he has to do versus like
[SPEAKER_05]: the collection that he has as far as moms
versus the phenol hunting that he's doing
[SPEAKER_05]: versus all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like it can be kind of exponential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like thinking back, it's like 80 percent
of my actual stock that I would keep would
[SPEAKER_00]: just be backups of moms and even counting
the flower stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still seems like all I kept was
constant backups of moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the majority of my stock.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see our I see our buddy Radio Ridge on
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of the stuff that I'm talking
about is trying to maintain moms like in a
[SPEAKER_05]: house inside in a garage and limited
space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, if you have if you have a
nursery or you have a greenhouse or
[SPEAKER_05]: multiple greenhouses and you can use
natural and artificial light, it gets a
[SPEAKER_05]: little easier.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of phenol hunting on that's done
when cannabis traditionally is a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thoughts on revinging a plant,
becoming a mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I instead of doing the outdoor thing
that not so I was talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do the revenge stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I and I tended to do it anyways
because, you know, if I lost, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: clone stock of a mom that I just flowered
out, what have you, or if something was
[SPEAKER_00]: was riding a lot slower than it than it
should be, it wasn't as resinous.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I give it a revenge and it
would just give it that little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I but I run my my bench at 24 hours
like all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really easy for me to revedge.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, somebody's talking about genetic
drift off the mainstream.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's part of the issue is that cannabis
is just starting to get studied in certain
[SPEAKER_05]: ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of new information coming
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of our traditional techniques are
going to come up against studies and
[SPEAKER_05]: science.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we're going to have to see
how it all plays out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I always try to take when it's
when it comes time to revedging for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really revedge.
[SPEAKER_05]: I revedge until I can take fully in
vegetative, healthy cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I start over.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, good plan to revedge is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just it just takes a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes one of the techniques that
breeders also use is sometimes like when
[SPEAKER_05]: you're phenol hunting, you you might take
a bunch of cuts like two weeks into into
[SPEAKER_05]: bloom and you end up going in there and
cleaning up a lot of the lowers,
[SPEAKER_05]: which you have to strip out anyway,
and you use those as cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they freak out for four to six
weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's actually helpful because it
slows down the process and they don't get
[SPEAKER_05]: too big.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you take a ton of perfectly
healthy cuts right before you flip,
[SPEAKER_05]: you might have to take cuttings multiple
times before you're even done with the
[SPEAKER_05]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're trying to keep them small and
contained.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So and there's I mean, the euros are
really big into revenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: They would do things like they wouldn't
keep any back stock of anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when they found flowers,
they like they would take that month,
[SPEAKER_05]: that plant out of the room and revedge it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a gamble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is easy to revedge for me because of
the 24 hours thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never really, really lost a lot of
plants and revedging.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also was a big fan of keeping as
much bud on the plant for revedging
[SPEAKER_00]: because bud would grow out of every I
mean, the revenge nodes would grow out of
[SPEAKER_00]: every single spot on that bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more bud you keep, the better the
chance you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people don't like that trade
off of like not being able to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cut cut bud off and smoke it and
do all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to a revenge,
sometimes it's one outweighs the other.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my Matt might disagree with me on
this, but if I had an inkling that I might
[SPEAKER_05]: want to revedge ever, I would typically
leave all the lowers on so that I could
[SPEAKER_05]: chop the plant way back and take all the
well-formed buds off and leave all the
[SPEAKER_05]: larvae funky stuff as the new tops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're not as far into bud as the
rest of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not as long of a process to get
them to snap back and go back into
[SPEAKER_05]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, so what people understand what we
mean by revedge, just so we get clear to,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure most people understand,
but when you flip, you take a vegetative
[SPEAKER_05]: plant and you flip it into bloom,
that white cycle releases a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: hormones, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And those hormones are there to like make
the plant produce flower and do all the
[SPEAKER_05]: various things it's going to do in bloom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you stop that process and you
throw it back into veg, it's got to work
[SPEAKER_05]: all those hormones out of itself,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where you get, you'll get a lot
of like single blades, three leaves,
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of very funny looking growth for a
while.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you kind of know you're out of it when
your plant starts throwing very normal
[SPEAKER_05]: leaf structure without any pistols or any
kind of weirdness like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it can take a few months.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, usually it does.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can take a few months, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And the more larve you leave on the
bottom, the easier it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying it's impossible,
but it is harder to get things to revedge
[SPEAKER_05]: out of main buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I usually get a pretty good
healthy growth out of all the buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: From my perspective, maybe I should
rephrase it, is you get less rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you might end up having to go out
there and cut out mold because now you've
[SPEAKER_05]: got this like overripe flower that's
trying to figure out what it wants to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's dense and you're trying to get
vegetative growth to come out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the bud is rotting around the
vegetative growth and you're cutting stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, I mean, there's a lot of
ways around it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, just not only that,
like not all strains act the same either.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, you know, the the killing of the
fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: The funny thing we always joke about is
like the the cuts that don't make it in
[SPEAKER_05]: the back up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are always the favorites.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's generally how it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one that you're like,
oh, my God, this one is amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've got like seventy five cuts
saved and you lost three and it's one of
[SPEAKER_05]: the three.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be very frustrating, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, you know, but that's mom
maintenance is basically like you can only
[SPEAKER_05]: leave a plant in a pot for so long.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's that there's an arc of health that
happens kind of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can get plants on the upswing and
on the downswing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes when you're revegging,
I should throw this out there sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Up potting the plant and giving the root
mass, especially if it's like you pulled
[SPEAKER_05]: it out late, giving the plant a bunch of
fresh oil to grow new roots into.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Versus like stuck in the same pot that
it's been kind of root bound a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: tends to help.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you ever do any root trimming,
root ball trimming?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't usually bonsai my shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I've done it, I've just fucking
trashed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've tried it like, you know,
I mean, bonsai is one thing, but fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming up the root ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always fucked that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot trim roots and keep shit alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I do think that like when you're
transplanting, I do like to take my hands
[SPEAKER_05]: and rough up the edges because unless
you're growing in like certain kinds of
[SPEAKER_05]: air prune pots, the a lot of the pots tend
to the roots tend to chase each other's
[SPEAKER_05]: tail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you and so you want to break that
up so they so they shoot out new shoots,
[SPEAKER_05]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about taking them and like if
they're in a fucking five gallon pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming the fucking root ball down to
like a fucking three gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever done that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not done that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen people take like bread knives
and like shave, you know, I just generally
[SPEAKER_05]: rough it up on the outside and on the
bottom as much as I can and then pop it
[SPEAKER_05]: in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that doesn't mean it might not work,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's I mean, that's kind of bonsai
techniques, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a lot of bonsai in apartment
growing, but I never could get the root
[SPEAKER_02]: mass shit down ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, bread knife, that type of
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, you know, generally speaking,
I would say everyone has different
[SPEAKER_05]: opinions on this, and it depends on what
you're using your mother for.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you should replace a mom every six to
nine months.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a general rule, you know, and always,
always, always keep the healthiest plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boosting the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, obviously, if you're not flowering
at the point at the point where you decide
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to revege a plant,
you're no longer feeding it for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're feeding it to be brought back to a
vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, feeding it more and cow
mag, all that shit helps a more balanced
[SPEAKER_00]: meal than as opposed to like a flour meal
that's low nitrogen, you definitely want
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna it's gonna freak out and look
weird for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so you have to have some patience.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we definitely have some
patience.
[SPEAKER_05]: You definitely have to have some patience
with the revenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a it's a useful technique.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a space saving technique,
just like anything else that has its own
[SPEAKER_05]: risks.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you could be you could be
bringing pests from your flower room that
[SPEAKER_05]: don't exist back into your mom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, that could happen,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I mean, mom maintenance is,
you know, it it takes a while for moms to
[SPEAKER_05]: to build up the right kind of cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you kind of start with like a
small plant that can give you one or two
[SPEAKER_05]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it kind of takes a few months of
training a plant to get like this plant is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to give me like a room's worth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I build my plant up to the next.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it really does depend on what your goal
for the plant is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I have a bunch of plants and a lot
of them I only need a few cuts off of
[SPEAKER_05]: every now and again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it doesn't do me any good having them
in a giant 10 gallon pot and as tall as
[SPEAKER_05]: me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, not at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but people let it get that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then sometimes it's really tempting
for a grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see a mom getting super healthy and
you don't want to beat the top the tar out
[SPEAKER_05]: of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to let it boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so so while we're talking about
mom health and and, you know, taking cuts,
[SPEAKER_00]: backing up cuts, what's one of the ones
that you've lost in that kind of situation
[SPEAKER_00]: where you were trying, you thought you
had, you know, clones of it backed up
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe and had one mom flowered it out and
realized you were fucked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've lost all kinds of plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it would be hard to pick just one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll start maybe like general and then we
can go into specifics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people, even most of my friends,
have always just wanted to bloom whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: was popular at the moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's easy to get Pete like when when
when it was the diesel craze or the purple
[SPEAKER_05]: craze or whatever, it was easy to get
friends to back up Urkel or Mendo P or
[SPEAKER_05]: sour or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the market changes and they're
not growing it for the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're trying to get them to hold on
to something for you so it doesn't get
[SPEAKER_05]: lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they don't want to give up the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of people that try to have
the smallest veg they can get away with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, veg doesn't make them
the money.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it doesn't make them the money,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm not even I'm not even dissing
them on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying that, like, that's kind of
how it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you end up trying to, like,
share things with people that you hope
[SPEAKER_05]: that they love.
[SPEAKER_05]: It enough that you can get it back from
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how a lot of these fakes and a lot of
these issues start is you have a real cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: You move on to do some rooms of something
else.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you go to get it back and it's
not it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or they killed it or they were worse at it
than you were, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so a lot of things got lost that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: People break up, have exes, you know,
that mess things up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get depressed, you move.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have accidents.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get busted.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a whole host of ways
where you lose things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think every old older grower,
every collector, every breeder has
[SPEAKER_05]: probably a list of shit that they wish
they still had.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I would think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I have a bunch of stuff that,
you know, I was fucking around with when I
[SPEAKER_05]: was in my early and mid 20s that I wish
that with my current experience I had
[SPEAKER_05]: right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a there's a bunch I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, especially during the Mooney one
where I handed over my whole collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, someone lost all of it in one shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, luckily, luckily most of that I
was able to get back from other people
[SPEAKER_00]: that I backed it up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was still a lot in there that my
own personal selections of my stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: never see again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that's probably one of the
more common occurring things for breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: is to lose their own personal selections
quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the market changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the the what people want to grow
changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you end up chasing something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, and then you can't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, look at right now, like,
you know, I talked about it on a previous
[SPEAKER_05]: show, but it's like sour was the most
popular strain in America for over 10
[SPEAKER_05]: years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's massive debate on who's got
the real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it turns out that most of the people
that have it didn't keep it when it was
[SPEAKER_05]: unpopular.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they tried to get it back when its
popularity came back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I had a bunch of friends that
had the Trinity and we all lost it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I spent 15 years looking for it and we
kept getting it back and it kept being
[SPEAKER_05]: fake.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's stories like that over and
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, what's one of your white whales
in terms of something that I lost or in
[SPEAKER_05]: terms of something that I want something
that you've lost?
[SPEAKER_05]: That you wish you still had.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had probably next to the Maui.
[SPEAKER_05]: The best thing I ever found in Amsterdam
of all the pops that I did was I found an
[SPEAKER_05]: amazing black domino fino.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was peppery.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was frosty.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was extremely potent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I still think about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it one of the purple ones?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it was darker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was darker, but it was not
purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a really nice kind of long running
cola.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't at the time even realize there
was like three or four versions of black
[SPEAKER_05]: domino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they made that apparent.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it wasn't really apparent,
but I bought it direct from Sensei in late
[SPEAKER_05]: 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and I had I had the warlock.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really liked the warlock.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maggis seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I really liked the warlock a whole
lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know, I lost this and I lost the
super skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've lost most things here and
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Luckily, I share and I don't hoard and
close friends have held it, but I haven't
[SPEAKER_05]: been able to find the super skunk since.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, skunk the A and some others
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been hunting for it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cough, I should I saw the cough.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cough lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the cough cough to the cough.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about if the cough to lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought this was the cough to maybe we
could ask homie if he's on here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think I think it's cough and I think
cough to is the one that's gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, one of the things about
that is that sadly, if you're I don't know
[SPEAKER_05]: if I don't know who made that comment or
where they're located, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's the the NL five hazes have not been
nearly as possible or popular on the West
[SPEAKER_05]: Coast as they are on the East.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they don't get circulated very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: The stuff that got circulated on the West
Coast was more jet was more the poly
[SPEAKER_05]: hybrids, the jacks, the super silver
hazes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, those are big.
[SPEAKER_05]: The really famous.
[SPEAKER_05]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cough two is gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_05]: So cough two is the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, so a lot of the really
famous ones, the only the only famous one
[SPEAKER_05]: that really made its way to the West Coast
was when the electric boogaloo got renamed
[SPEAKER_05]: the dog ship.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that one's on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost all the other famous cuts started
and stayed somewhere east of the West
[SPEAKER_05]: Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think even like one of the versions of
the San Diego campus is like a super
[SPEAKER_00]: silver haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw a lot of that, but not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not a lot of the NL five days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And somebody just asked, you know,
how did I lose the super skunk?
[SPEAKER_05]: I got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and they didn't let me keep
anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he got caught at the rest stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a real fucked up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was it was a messed up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I law it took me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got the vast majority as far as clones
go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got the vast majority of what I lost
that day back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not.
[SPEAKER_05]: The super skunk has been gone forever
since the super dog, which was my buddy
[SPEAKER_05]: and I's project to blend super skunk and
and cam together.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: The black dominant was gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other things like the flow rider and the
Mendo P and, you know, the the the
[SPEAKER_05]: headband and sours and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had those I had enough stuff spread out
that it eventually all came back to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was some stuff that there was
half a dozen things that got lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but it does it does force you to
move on and go down different avenues,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think is always a plus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got we I got from another mutual
friend of ours.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got what we thought was the super skunk
back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I got evacuated and I lost it in
the 17 fires again.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it sucked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I damn it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I literally drove out of that
property with like the L.A.
[SPEAKER_05]: between my legs and the Kendi by my feet
and a dog cutting right next.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I had like six one gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I could fit is I fled.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, that's fucking wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but sure does.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there and there's a bunch of Mac
and talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a bunch of famous SoCal stuff,
you know, that we joke about quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like the bull rider.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hog's breath.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there was some things that were
kind of common.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Down there, at least in terms of being
sold and this and that they got their
[SPEAKER_05]: legend to them and they're gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hog breast luckily still around,
but it's always been kept super tight
[SPEAKER_00]: until the last maybe five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's been getting out everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if for a long time it was kept very
tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bull rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen bull rider like I've gone
down, you know, been lived down there for
[SPEAKER_00]: over a decade in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't around even by the time I
got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bull rider was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani bull rider was still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you always still hear these stories
about like the original bull rider and how
[SPEAKER_00]: good it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: The closest we have is apparently old
Betsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if it's anything like old Betsy,
it's probably like a skunk one and all
[SPEAKER_00]: five days tight, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can speak to this Afghani bull rider,
I think, is a descendant of the bull
[SPEAKER_05]: rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if it if it's been
proven to even be a descendant might be
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing with a different name.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, definitely isn't the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know if they're necessarily
even descended from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might have just been two things that
got similar names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't really know much about the
dudes who've made bull rider or Afghani
[SPEAKER_00]: bull rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's Jeff Tack and then there's
other people who say they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, if if bull rider is anything
like old Betsy, then Afghani bull rider
[SPEAKER_00]: was totally Afghani dominant and had no
traits like the old Betsy, if that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think lots of regions have,
you know, stories like that of those
[SPEAKER_05]: plants that are popular.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, we're going to save the
purple story for another episode,
[SPEAKER_05]: and we're going to try to get our buddy on
here to chat about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, but I can say that, you know,
in the mid 2000s, like most of the
[SPEAKER_05]: commercial growers, indoor growers,
especially up by me and Mendo on Southern
[SPEAKER_05]: Humboldt, they all had Urkel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or it was everywhere for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it becomes unpopular.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like and there's like four dudes that
kept it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that might be exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, maybe there's no, but there was
so few so few people kept it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's kind of what happens is,
is everything so popular, people can never
[SPEAKER_05]: imagine it going away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can't find it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and what happens when that's the
case?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, there's there's an
aspect to it now where it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, the wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's interesting that JJ had access to
the wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to grow the wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had some buddies of mine from Chicago
that ended up moving out to Boulder and
[SPEAKER_05]: Longmont and some of that area.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they we all had the wheelchair back
then.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't have any idea what it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of an era in the 90s where
there was a lot of variety.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my my interest in lineage hadn't
sprouted super hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was a pretty famous thing in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a Colorado AK 47 that smelled
smelled like sandalwood and yielded
[SPEAKER_05]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's there was a bunch of
good cuts that that went away in a way.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the name strains that started with
the purple craze and four or five,
[SPEAKER_05]: they've all been I've said it before,
they've all been bad for diversity.
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as everyone could grow purple,
and sell it, that was bad for diversity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was afterwards when everyone
could grow sour cushion, sell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was bad for diversity, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very bad for diversity skills.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can basically name every super popular
strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And not only was it bad for diversity,
but then once the Feminized Revolution
[SPEAKER_05]: happened, everybody crossed it into
everything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the era that we're talking about,
like in the 90s and the early 2000s,
[SPEAKER_05]: that was sort of like the last era where
all good weed sold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I mean, you can talk about me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, if you had a bunch of bull rider
today, how easy would it be for you to
[SPEAKER_05]: even find a market for it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I like based on what old Betsy is,
I don't think there would be a market for
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so it's like some of these
legends that are amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like try to sell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the gar, somebody said the gar.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: The gar might live.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, the gar was like an 11 week
garlic bud that was in the SoCal kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: Santa Barbara ish area.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So any the trinity, the Trinity lineage,
I know it exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's bag seed from a bag of Heddy's
that a glassblower got in Trinity selling
[SPEAKER_05]: some glass pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just said they won't take shoreline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your line not selling?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't surprise me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, like if they smoked it,
they dig it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I guess based on what they want
and the way Bud looks, that's what's sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say they want shit until they have
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we were in an era where looks and
height matters more than effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of our friends, I see a good
friend of ours posting on Nobody Wants
[SPEAKER_05]: Cough.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a there's an aspect of
it where a lot of my friends hold on to
[SPEAKER_05]: their favorites, not because they're
marketable, but because they love them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody wants them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, bastards.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're like, you know, you grow a room
of it, you grow a crop of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you are going to sell it,
they're going to try to hammer you down on
[SPEAKER_05]: price because it's not, you know,
zookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just said they won't take it because of
the name of shoreline.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't take it because of the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's not shoreline flambé or first
shoreline cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about the San Diego green
crack.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't really speak to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can say that green crack is most likely
a skunk one fino.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but I mean, it's one of these
things where it's like and that's that's
[SPEAKER_05]: actually an aspect of like the the current
market is a lot of you a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you buy if you buy from dispensaries,
the dispensary has to want to buy that
[SPEAKER_05]: weed for you to be able to buy it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a distribution company has to be
willing to buy that weed to offer it to
[SPEAKER_05]: the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of good weed that people
don't get to see because they're like,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh, that that name is weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, but I'll take your I'll
take your starburst.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I'll take your cake or I'll take your
whatever, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I mean, you know,
like with the with the green crack with
[SPEAKER_00]: the vessels talking about, too,
and you like whenever I hear mango,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first thing I think is usually skunk
one because that's it's almost everything
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ever smelled with mango has some
skunk one dominance in it of some sort for
[SPEAKER_00]: the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not always be the case because I've
had like mango or a cantaloupe mango type
[SPEAKER_00]: pure Afghani from a rat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically, I would say skunk one is
what usually trips that mango turp for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone just mentioned, you know,
is it because the buyers at these
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensaries are only in their are in
their 20s?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's not it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of it is because the
dispensaries exist to make money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they want the best deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to make the most money off their
shelf space.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so even in the two fifteen era,
there was a lot of stuff that people
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't want to didn't want to sell
because, you know, you can't really buy a
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of good sativas and dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't sell J1 in San Diego because
it was like the at least during the era I
[SPEAKER_00]: was there, all of the collectives called
their like their worst of the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just called it J1 like around the
downtown area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people just would not buy J1 anywhere
in San Diego after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just ruined the whole name for a
whole city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody mentioned this, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're probably right.
[SPEAKER_05]: If our homie, you know, lived in New York
City or somewhere around there where that
[SPEAKER_05]: could be his market, cough might be
popular.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because there's a there's a there's
a there's a decent market for an L5 Hayes
[SPEAKER_05]: type phenos over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: See if this has salt in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No salt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Snowcap was, yeah, the AK-47, the PES
still exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's AK-47 that still exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: Snowcap is kind of just a big chunky
Afghan.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that one's still around.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really grown a lot in Mendo for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're putting the PES in in the
NL5 hybrid round.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, our buddy CSI still holds it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I had it for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I mean, there's you know,
there's the PIF is really and L5 Hayes is
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of really unsellable unless you're on
this section of the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's not popular in the West,
it's not popular in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Train wreck, we could save the train wreck
story until I'll see that for CSI.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have a buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, but yeah, there's a lot of
stuff that that that comes out that has
[SPEAKER_05]: its it has its name and has its time in
the sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the PES is probably an NL phenyl.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I believe that's what he said was an
NL phenyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're moving in the NL5 stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's an NL phenyl.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an old NL phenyl.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of this stuff is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just, you know, it just doesn't it
just loses just loses popularity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then someone's like, I want whatever
I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want someone to come to my house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if I go take it somewhere, I want
everyone to buy it quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think someone's confusing PIF with HB 13
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if Brooklyn really likes
sativa because they want to be more
[SPEAKER_05]: productive.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Cubans and Dominicans and,
you know, various groups up there sold it
[SPEAKER_05]: a bunch.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a bunch of people smoked it and a
bunch of rich people and elites and stars
[SPEAKER_05]: back there wanted it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it kind of fueled a haze wave in
New York, much like wealthy people fueled
[SPEAKER_05]: a cush wave in L.A.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then eventually it kind of it gets a
life of its own.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and I'm not saying that,
like, people might not prefer it,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's just like, that's the thing is,
it's like it's got a market there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, for a long time, I used to joke
that, like, you know, you'd go into
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensary 10 years ago and in L.A.
[SPEAKER_05]: and there's like which one we have 42
strains and 38 of them are cush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one do you want?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it was just endless.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if he what's up, Dickie?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, Hayes is rap weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, Hayes is, yeah,
Washington Heights.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that kind of area like the Cuban
black, you know, the brown, the Dominican.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a bunch of different names added
to it and slang.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of it was grown in Florida and
shipped to New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it's kind of one of those
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Heard of the Ingrid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Heard of the Ingrid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about the Ingrid.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you know about the Ingrid?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know anything about the Ingrid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know anything about the Ingrid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the cool thing about the cool
thing about sativas like NL5 Hayes and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff is they do have a different buzz.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they they they, you know,
they basically like hit you differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they're they're really that's the
cough.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all have a really good effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times people feel warm.
[SPEAKER_05]: They feel happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: They get a different kind of buzz.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times they're ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Injured cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's injured cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not Ingrid cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Injured cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So PIF is not an NL5 Hayes and different
than HP.
[SPEAKER_00]: No PIF is probably an NL5 Hayes and HP 13
is not related.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, yeah, I mean, there's
there's a bunch of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so like on the West Coast,
it's like a lot of people shit on Hayes
[SPEAKER_05]: because most of the best phenos of it
never made its way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the West Coast... Ask Gene what the
Ingrid is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll ask him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Gene, what's the Ingrid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know anything about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I've heard of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, you just say his buddy had it,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is PIF the same as Cuban Black?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a number of phenos that float
around.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of times, you know, names get
used independently and of each other,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, or interchangeably, I should
say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I used to think that PIF, Cuban Black,
Heights, Hayes, I could name four or five
[SPEAKER_05]: other names were all kind of names for the
same strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some people from back there were
like, oh, no, this one is this and this
[SPEAKER_05]: one is that.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why this is that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, it's just another more
more compartmentalized knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I'll do this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain the difference between HP
13, G13 and 88 G13 HP?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: G13 HP is a hybrid with G13 in it and HP
13 is related to neither.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Cuban Black Hayes is an NL5 Hayes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mostly, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a number of different
nicknames for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Lizard Hash Plan, I have no
idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but I mean, I love old weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Puck and Udub.
[SPEAKER_05]: Puck is an old hash plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: They used to call it Puck because it got a
dude used to carry it around in a hockey
[SPEAKER_05]: puck container.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a bubble tape, bubble tape,
bubble tape container.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Type of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they ended up calling it the Puck.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an old, ugly hash plant looking
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's mostly famous for being old.
[SPEAKER_05]: For being old and people keeping it back
for no reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's, you know, we have some
buddies from that part of Colorado and
[SPEAKER_05]: like out of the half a dozen strains that
those guys used to run, the Puck was one
[SPEAKER_05]: of their least favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't mean they didn't like it,
but it's always been short, hard to grow,
[SPEAKER_05]: notoriously hard to root.
[SPEAKER_05]: But one of it is old.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: How old is the G13 clone that's floating
around?
[SPEAKER_05]: G13 is one of those things that has a
bunch of legends to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Neville claimed that the G13 that they
sent out to Europe got sick and died by 93
[SPEAKER_05]: or so.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been a lot of claims.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the G13 that people talk about is
actually G13 NL2, which was sold as a line
[SPEAKER_05]: by Neville for some time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Matt even got some of those beans
from Neville.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But G13 and we should deal with this now
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like with the NL or G13 or Hayes or
any of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all these, the nineties are long
ago now where these legends, people pop up
[SPEAKER_05]: with this legendary name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even if you're a casual stoner,
you might've heard of these legendary
[SPEAKER_05]: strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then someone pops up with seeds or a
clone or this or that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, funny story.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, they never tend to pop up.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't pop up with the unpopular old
weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always the most famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Airborne is the G13 NL2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a specific selection from G13 NL2
that looked most like the G13 clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a buddy who very well might've had
a very old, old, old G13 in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_05]: It got infected with the virus and was
lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was an old G13 floating around
Ohio that supposedly tied back to the
[SPEAKER_05]: eighties.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Fletcher said that that one was
airborne.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was, yeah, there was an airborne
cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what was the other one named?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacifica.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they call it Pacific G13.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I ran all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up making S1s of the airborne and
sending those back to Neville to do
[SPEAKER_00]: projects with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wasn't a fan of the Pacific G13.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like it, but the airborne,
I did think was pretty fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thunderfuck is a famous name.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got some quarter pounds from a guy on
Dead Tour who mailed them from me from
[SPEAKER_05]: Denali, Alaska, in, I don't know,
93 or 94 or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I loved that weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And every, every Thunderfuck I've seen has
been nothing like it since.
[SPEAKER_05]: It appears that Thunderfuck has been
around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thunderfuck was like kind of a catch-all
name, kind of like Maui Waui, maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that there was any number of different
things grown under that label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, Vestal, that is exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from the foreign days,
the airborne.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a selection of G13 and all too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I even remember people like Hempi
and Vic High and all that arguing back and
[SPEAKER_05]: forth over whether they were different,
what the provenance on it was,
[SPEAKER_05]: and all this and that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a hot debate for a minute,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And my buddy Subrob's from Alaska,
from that area, and he's been shouting
[SPEAKER_00]: from the rooftops forever that like,
look, dude, no one ever had the same
[SPEAKER_00]: Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you lived during that time in
Alaska, no one ever had the same
[SPEAKER_00]: Thunderfuck twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was never the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was never a single cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, the Thunderfuck that I had,
dude, someone asked me what the Terps were
[SPEAKER_05]: like.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in my teens then and partying a lot
and traveling a bunch.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do remember that it was nicer than most
of the kind, but I could get at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have fond memories of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But do I have a clear memory from 1993,
1994 of what it tasted like?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And mostly just because it's really hard
to describe Terps and nose.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like one of the hardest things in
wheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a lot of language for visual
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have poor language for smells.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: In my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, most of the time when we talk
about, now that there's like some terpenes
[SPEAKER_05]: coming up, people start talking about
Terpenolene or Mersene or this or that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But most of the time people talk about
smells, not about like the actual smell,
[SPEAKER_05]: but what it reminds them of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The shit smells like linoleum or pencil
shavings or poop or a guy's dick or skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a guy's dick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so I mean, yeah, you know,
you probably missed the era to name a
[SPEAKER_05]: strain from under.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's probably it's probably not the
time for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could see a few dudes doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could see a few dudes doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, you have to relate it to
something else.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, some of them are really easy,
like Cali or tangy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Citrus is really common.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be like, oh, that's citrus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody knows what what it's like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, some things and not everyone
when they smell things, remember,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh, that smells like pencil shavings from
when I used to sharpen my pencil in grade
[SPEAKER_05]: school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everybody has that memory.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never I've never seen the Dewberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, CSI describes one of the Mendo
perp's he knows as I want to say it's
[SPEAKER_00]: either king snake shit or coral snake
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've talked to him about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually got a very distinctive
kind of poo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coral snake shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: But unless you've smelled it, I mean,
yeah, that's kind of what we laugh about
[SPEAKER_05]: with all the euros is like skunks don't
even exist in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they've never smelled.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've never smelled roadkill unless they
traveled over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, most Americans have smelled the
dead skunk at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, because you drive by and it's
very potent.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but I mean, that's kind of like
as far as like strains that were lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: I a lot of the hazes, I've been kind of a
haze freak for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I used to think I honestly the first
four or five times I went to Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_05]: I was pretty convinced that they had bunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was all a great marketing kick.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that like my friends and the hippies
and the dead tour kids that I knew,
[SPEAKER_05]: we had way better weed than anyone in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I met some folks and I ended up
smoking some of the famous haze cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's never been the same sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, and so but those things,
those things are legends.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, you know, they just started
circulating in America the last couple of
[SPEAKER_05]: years.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think nl5 haze is famous for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a good one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about Shanti Baba's work
these days?
[SPEAKER_05]: I will admit that I poke less holes in
Shanti's work than most of my friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say that's probably accurate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think that one of the cool
things that Shanti Baba has done is he has
[SPEAKER_05]: not really mixed a bunch of his work with
everything new.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and so if you want to get some
stuff that at least has a bunch of old
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics, there's a lot of that on offer
through him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, it might take more work to
find something that you want out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's a huge debate as to like what he
still has and what he's lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and there was always a lot of
junk in the Amsterdam stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amsterdam stuff, in my opinion,
had a low floor on a high ceiling.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, which is not how people like it
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: People like a high floor.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to get a lot of average weed or
just above average weed that looks pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot of shit I popped from same
seed banks back in the day that was ugly
[SPEAKER_05]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then there's phenos that popped out of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That people still hold today that are
amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can't really I can't really say I
think that there is real stuff amongst
[SPEAKER_05]: Shanti Baba's work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a bunch of junk in it,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's like an indictment of
him necessarily.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's indisputable that he bought Neville's
old seed stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's also indisputable that he worked
with Neville and Neville gave him a number
[SPEAKER_05]: of breeding cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's one of the few people that can
actually claim to have access to some of
[SPEAKER_05]: that old stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also think the, you know,
the times have passed him by and people
[SPEAKER_05]: don't go to him very much anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're not searching through his
stuff very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, he kind of I mean,
if you think about it, he came out with
[SPEAKER_05]: Neville's haze, super silver haze and
manganese mango haze and what was it,
[SPEAKER_05]: 97 or 98.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somewhere around there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he came out with White Widow.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's made some really big contributions to
the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just mostly multiple decades old.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with Shanti, I found it like if
I wanted to find a longer flowering line
[SPEAKER_00]: that is going to have some going to have
some uniqueness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turquoise and genetics wise, he's a great
place to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted, you'll have to to dedicate a lot
of space to a good sized pot because it is
[SPEAKER_00]: older stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like it hasn't been bred for the
past 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking just for resin production and just
for THC potency and testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but if you want to find good old,
like, heady sativa shit, his stuff is some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the best places to start.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with Gene.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said the mango haze is fire fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The mother cut is based off of is my
favorite cut of NL five haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love, love, love a bit ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appeared in America, you know,
and, you know, his his white widow,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially in the 90s and his white family
kind of changed the game.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could also you could you could say to
that since since regular seed lines are
[SPEAKER_05]: becoming rarer and rarer.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you wanted to actually start doing some
back crossing and you needed a male pollen
[SPEAKER_05]: donor.
[SPEAKER_05]: He offers all regular seed lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I was going to say is that when
it comes to his Afghani lines and his more
[SPEAKER_00]: indicative type stuff, I have not had as
much success with that stuff as I have
[SPEAKER_00]: with his haze haze lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the hazes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody somebody just said his Shanti
shit line is white hot fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad you found something you liked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I ran through some shit and I
thought it was pretty shitty.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was one that just that just
goes to show that, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: that you could run through a few hundred
seeds and it's all bunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then one guy gets one pack and find
something that they think is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people will find like like pop
skunk one stuff that haven't experienced
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk one so much and be like,
this is fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And definitely if you're looking for
sativa based lines that are that are
[SPEAKER_05]: workable, Shanti has that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it's, you know,
I like him more than most, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we all have our like we all have our
favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked him until that last dealing where
I wanted to buy some shit and he was all
[SPEAKER_00]: weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, he he, you know,
I tend to think I mean, but that's it's
[SPEAKER_05]: you can you can get a bunch of us together
and start talking about about which old
[SPEAKER_05]: character from the 90s you think is the
least shady.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's hard to get anybody to agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tend to lean into the Shanti Neville
camp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's people that are very into Dave
Watson, Sam Skunkman.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, you know, it's, you know,
there's people that are very into a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: these old guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's kind of like imagine people
debating all the people that we know 20
[SPEAKER_05]: years from now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have your camps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so real quick, someone asked about the
and all five stuff because I'm getting
[SPEAKER_00]: tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to cut it kind of
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and all five stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have three main cuts that we're
going to like let out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is the bubblegum, you know,
that I've talked about before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is more bubblegum than bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cut that me and CSI and a bunch of
others use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is extremely pink bubblegummy and loud
with the pink bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have a lot of pineapple,
a lot of tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a specific citrus cut that we
kept cuts up and well, we kept cuts to
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as like things that we thought
are keepers in terms of what is considered
[SPEAKER_00]: keepers nowadays are the bubblegum,
the citrus and then one that we just
[SPEAKER_00]: called the ranch tank just because there's
no good way to describe it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it's right as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the three main like if you're
going to be pulling for really cool shit
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all three of those are pretty fucking
rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: The taste transfers a little bit better
than the Indiana bubblegum cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are the three main ones that we
kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of different offerings
in it is it is a very, very line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, hopefully that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're part of the Patreon,
if you're part of the Breeders Syndicate
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon, you can go right now and buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to have backstage access if
you're part of the Patreon and you still
[SPEAKER_00]: can't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zico dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then get a hold of me and I'll make sure
that your account is hooked up so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, me and Gene just made a comment
that I think deserves to be highlighted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe he said, I don't believe in people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe in dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have this free way.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have we have this phrase we use all the
time that plants don't lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so some of our like chem dog talk and
some of that other stuff that we were
[SPEAKER_05]: doing earlier in previous episodes was
kind of about our speculation on like what
[SPEAKER_05]: the plants are telling us versus the
story.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And dank is dank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everybody agrees that every cut is
dank, obviously.
[SPEAKER_05]: But most elites, a decent amount of people
think this weed is fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and, you know, in all honesty,
you're you're no comments on the Elvis.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody really knows what
the Elvis was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran the cut for a long time,
gave to SkunkmasterFlex and never saw it
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as what it was, it could be an
NL5 haze, but just nobody really knows.
[SPEAKER_05]: I I don't have a lot of backstory on the
Elvis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like we're trying to ignore it,
you know, but, you know, sometimes it's
[SPEAKER_05]: not like we're an encyclopedia on just
about everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Elvis is a famous cut, but, you know,
it got passed around.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever grown it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never I've never grown it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have I have very little actual like
intelligent discourse on that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not ignoring you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine came from Ms. Elvis on THC Farmer
back in the day, who is a dude that had he
[SPEAKER_00]: had the regular Elvis cut and then he had
one called the the pink Cadillac cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave me both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought it was dank for the time,
but I don't know if it would be considered
[SPEAKER_00]: dank nowadays.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I don't know if we can talk to
we can talk to CSI.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he takes a ton of pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: There could be some pictures coming of
more pictures of the NL.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, there's tons more coming to the
NL five different ones of the various of
[SPEAKER_05]: the various rooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the coolest things about CSI
is that he's pretty transparent about,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, about his process and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so people will be able to get to see
Finos.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And things of that nature fairly soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's dank nowadays?
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, I'm more of a classics kind of
person.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's dank is what you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, that's really what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever jives best with your brain
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_05]: This weed is dank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Means I like smoking this weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if enough people decide that weed
is dank, it generally gets popular and
[SPEAKER_05]: becomes an elite of some kind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's gotten confusing with legality
because everyone wants to have the dank
[SPEAKER_05]: and everyone wants to have white hot fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everything that they're growing is an
elite of an elite.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all they get is fucking wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_05]: So fuck them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, it's it's it's become a lot
modern marketing rather than like crowd
[SPEAKER_05]: testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For lack of a better term, you know,
and.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they, you know, a lot of the
stuff that that I have and some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff I've been sharing with CSI and
others and stuff like that, it's just like
[SPEAKER_05]: old favorites.
[SPEAKER_05]: It worked with me really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I held onto it, you know, and I mean,
it's a shame.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a shame that we don't have a catalog
of all the old strains and all the old
[SPEAKER_05]: eras and seed stock and cutting saved and
all that, because the collection we would
[SPEAKER_05]: have of diversity from even 1990 to now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is only, you know, 30 years or 32
years, Jesus, but would be pretty insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you feeling hella old after saying
that?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what made me think I feel old as
I saw this thing that said that right now
[SPEAKER_05]: the we're far we're as far away from the
90s as we were from the 60s in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that made me feel old.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that'll do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That made me feel old.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I have I have a 23 year old
daughter and she does a great job of
[SPEAKER_05]: making me feel old all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm regularly reminded how
ancient I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should feel old.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm not that old, really.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm only 40s, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's the new 20.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I was 22, I probably I thought a
45 year old dude was hella old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude, I thought 40 year old was
hella old until I was fucking 38.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I started thinking we think of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so but I mean, that's what's cool
about it, right, is that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: people now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we'll I don't know if we'll end on
this, but I should just say it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The 90s, the 80s and 90s in the early
2000s are long enough away now that we are
[SPEAKER_05]: getting a deluge of ancient, amazing lines
and seeds and cuts from all over the
[SPEAKER_05]: place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And somehow when I was searching for these
things like crazy 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't find most of them anywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because they were unpopular and
nobody could make any money off them and
[SPEAKER_05]: they were fucking nowhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that there's like a whole new
generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: That, you know, all of a sudden,
it's like all this ancient stuff that you
[SPEAKER_05]: heard about or you read about in high
times or is, you know, like skunk one is
[SPEAKER_05]: new again.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's this?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Even this even this like laughable debate
over who's got real sour thunderfuck,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, sours old enough now that
there's a bunch of smokers that grew up in
[SPEAKER_05]: the, you know, if you came, if you started
smoking weed in the last 10 or 12 years,
[SPEAKER_05]: you were in the cookie Skittles cake.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dessert era.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might not have smoked a bunch of,
and most people, sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: They think the real sour is the first one
they smoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mean it was the real one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just means that was their first
personal experience, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, green merchant, you know,
most people don't know that green
[SPEAKER_05]: merchant.
[SPEAKER_05]: They rated every hydro store in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to go to hydro stores in a
friend's car who didn't grow in case our
[SPEAKER_05]: license plate get got written down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was, it was, it was a real issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to find a friend who you could pay
who was willing to take some risk and
[SPEAKER_05]: drive you to the store because no one ever
wanted to be near the store with a license
[SPEAKER_05]: plate tied to a grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so part of the gig, part of the
gig, you know, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think if there was anything
else I had to plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so fucking tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all five's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I'll five will be up for Monday
for everyone who else who wants to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a part of Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be up on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check the right seat code.com site for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, pretty soon we'll have some Hawaiian
lights stuff, as well as some,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, crosses with some of not so stuff on
the Hawaiian lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep posted on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, uh, other than that,
I think we're, oh, check out speakeasy
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they've been helping us get these
podcasts up and fast or check out their
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else not so from your end?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, obviously we, you know,
normally we chat longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt's tired.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll cut it a little short tonight,
which is fine, but we're, we're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be doing this every Friday and we're going
to be trying to bring people together.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're super open to ideas.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene's next Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene's next Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone go DM them about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to come on next Friday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I mean, we're, we want to bring
friends on and we want to bring community
[SPEAKER_05]: on.
[SPEAKER_05]: We basically just want to bullshit about
weed and try to get a bunch of advertising
[SPEAKER_05]: out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sort of flip the script, which is like
98% self promotion and 2% history and kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of reverse it flipped it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We flipped it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 98% history and bullshitting and 2%
2% self promotion, 2% self promotion,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, cause you need a little self
promotion to keep the whole movie going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in general, but in generally speaking,
um, you know, the, um, uh, CSI will have a
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of pictures up about he ran multiple
rooms of the Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll have a bunch of pictures of phenos
that he's popping up as him and Matt start
[SPEAKER_05]: to sell some of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He saved a bunch of the work he crossed to
various selected phenos.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got some open pollination work.
[SPEAKER_05]: He really is a very thorough man when it
comes to reading.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so we're trying to lock all this
different stuff in and, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and, you know, so yeah, ask us questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can ask us questions on the discord.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can always DM us.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can ask us questions in the posts and
we really do take those into account.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to think of what we want to
talk about because we want to talk about
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, yeah, that's all we care about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to be a little shorter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, hopefully next week if we'll lock in
gene and we can talk about a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that next week, plan on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gene, you know, and I'll say this,
you know, uh, gene lives in, I don't want
[SPEAKER_05]: to call it my neighborhood, but like we
live in the same County.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I've lived here since 98.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was born and raised here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you know, his, his, uh, his parents
were weed farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's a certain amount of history
and just sameness that comes with growing
[SPEAKER_05]: up in the same era and the same people and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe we could talk a little bit about
some of his own work or some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: gorilla stuff or some of the phases of
what it was like trying to get away with
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely into the same kind of dudes,
which I appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always have a similar taste in men.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a, we have a similar backstory.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: We came from similar eras and a lot of
those eras, they're only stuck in your
[SPEAKER_05]: memory.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you don't have other people to talk
about them, they're just stuck in your own
[SPEAKER_05]: head.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, ask a bunch of questions,
ask a bunch of follow-up questions,
[SPEAKER_05]: hit us up on our discord on the breeders
syndicate discord, hit us up on IG on the
[SPEAKER_05]: DMS.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, questions that pop into your head from
any conversation, keep it going,
[SPEAKER_05]: keep it talking, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and if you think that we've said
something wrong, question it, question it,
[SPEAKER_05]: question everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not, we're not talking down to
anyone or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to get information out there
and debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm often wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so with, I'm all, I'm often wrong
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So question everything I fucking say I'm
half awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good night everyone.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good
night.
Good night.
