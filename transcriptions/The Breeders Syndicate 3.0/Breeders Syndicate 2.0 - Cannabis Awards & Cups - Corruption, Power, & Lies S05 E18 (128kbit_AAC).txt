[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_04]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Notso Dog, Breeder and Grower from
[SPEAKER_04]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, how's everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Matthew.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my buddy, Notso.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're going to talk about some
cups, and we're not talking about the kind
[SPEAKER_05]: that protect your genitals.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are talking about the kinds that come
with awards for prestigious
[SPEAKER_05]: accomplishments in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, one of my homies, Grayskull,
hit me up and asked me if I could let
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone know that a fellow outlawed
grower has gone down.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to raise some money for
Emerald Delta over on GoFundMe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you can, we're going to have a link
kind of floating up in the description as
[SPEAKER_05]: we're going, like on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Type it in the description.
[SPEAKER_05]: All that, yadda, yadda, yadda.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go help a friend out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all weed charges, and it's like
$160,000 bail in Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_05]: So fuck the police.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so let's continue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so cups, cups and events.
[SPEAKER_05]: Recently, a big event has happened called
the Ganjir event, or Cowboy Cup,
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cowboy Cup, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you've seen it out and about.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the old Instagrams and the other social
medias, it's been popping up a bunch.
[SPEAKER_05]: People have been wanting to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to put up a quick explanation
kind of from Ganjir.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that is the best one to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it's on this window.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you see it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a quick explanation from
Ganjir.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of what happened, and I won't read the
whole thing, but I'll scroll through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It said, last weekend, 12 certified
Ganjirs were chosen to judge at the 2022
[SPEAKER_05]: Cowboy Cup in Stillwater, Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_05]: The judges were selected by both Ganjir
team and organizers of the Cowboy Cup
[SPEAKER_05]: based on experience, field of expertise,
and ensure diverse viewpoints were
[SPEAKER_05]: represented.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, they chose a bunch of
judges.
[SPEAKER_05]: They go into detail about how judges were
chosen, whatever, and people were allowed
[SPEAKER_05]: to submit samples.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they had to have COAs with their
samples, certificate of authenticity,
[SPEAKER_05]: basically saying that there's no mold,
no residual chemicals from growth,
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever, no junk in your shit,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So they had to submit paperwork with each
sample.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at the Cup, I guess they had
microscopes, like they show right here,
[SPEAKER_05]: sitting there to analyze each sample.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here are the results.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, despite the COA, they wanted to
review each sample there under the
[SPEAKER_05]: microscope, which I think is actually
good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a great safeguard,
because you never know what kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: authenticity these labs really bring to
the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can also see trichome development
and stuff, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you get a much better view of the
bud, obviously, and people that understand
[SPEAKER_05]: buds can get an actual good look at it,
what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the samples, it says, unfortunately,
results were not great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of the 12 samples, in the sun-grown
category, 10 were found to consistently
[SPEAKER_05]: show both visual and aromatic indications
of contamination.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means 10 smelled like mold or
whatever, presence of something,
[SPEAKER_05]: some kind of scent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of the eight samples, in the light assist
category, seven were found to consistently
[SPEAKER_05]: show both visual and aromatic indications
of contamination.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of the 20 samples in the indo category,
two were found to consistently show both
[SPEAKER_05]: visual and aromatic indications of
contamination.
[SPEAKER_05]: This means that contamination was clearly
visible in 19 of the 40 samples submitted
[SPEAKER_05]: to us for assessment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's some pictures, so you guys can
get an idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies and gents, I'm sorry, I always say
guys, ladies and gents, can get an idea
[SPEAKER_05]: for some of the contamination in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It said, because the levels of
contamination were both clear and evident
[SPEAKER_05]: to the certified gonjirs, the samples were
disqualified from the competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Each disqualified sample was photo
documented for proof of the contamination.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not looking good for the Oklahoma
entrance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I got to remove this thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: So not looking good for the Oklahoma
entrance.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a lot of people really hyper
super pissed off that thought that there
[SPEAKER_05]: was some rigging going on that maybe these
people were trying to sell them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess during a speech or some kind of
public post that one of the people from
[SPEAKER_05]: gonjir made, it offered them some training
in being able to spot contamination and
[SPEAKER_05]: mold and maybe how to grow different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this upset a lot of people because
they're like, we're growers, we know our
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff, we had COAs, you had a little scope
with the, you know, you know, stuff like
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of how it was taken.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really interesting to watch how
it turns out in the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I will say, I do think it's
a little, just to start, I think it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: little silly that in California,
in the West Coast, at least, I would say
[SPEAKER_03]: that when people are going for awards and
things like that, they, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they make sure that what they're
submitting is hopefully not going to do
[SPEAKER_03]: that, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just grabbing random handfuls.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can find 19 out of 40, that's
basically 50%.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can find visible enough mold that
all the judges agree it needs to go,
[SPEAKER_03]: then, you know, there wasn't that very
good quality control for a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: entrants, put it that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where we know we're at with the
situation now, but we kind of wanted to
[SPEAKER_05]: talk about how we got to this situation,
the points of harvest cups and how they
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of originated and onto the Amsterdam
cannabis cups and on into, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: other sorts of quasi harvest cups.
[SPEAKER_05]: They maybe started more traditional and
legit, that became more corporate and onto
[SPEAKER_05]: where we're at with a lot of these,
you know, extract throw downs.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to start, I mean, not so who knows
better about the early cannabis cups and
[SPEAKER_05]: my boy, not so, so let's jump into this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, yeah, I mean, I, I think there's
probably two kinds you could say,
[SPEAKER_03]: you could say of cups.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was, like you mentioned,
there was a lot of informal cups,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are essentially friends gathering to
share weed, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's like cups that are
advertised and more famous and like the,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like the high times cannabis
cups and the, you know, the Emerald cup
[SPEAKER_03]: and a lot of the different, you know,
hashish competitions or different things
[SPEAKER_03]: that have happened where it's a little bit
more public.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a result of that, there's usually
money and rep involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it brings a different, it brings a
different flavor to it, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, these days as, as evidenced
by some cowboy cup in Oklahoma,
[SPEAKER_03]: cups are just events that anyone can hold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a result, there's hundreds of cups
across America now, probably when it comes
[SPEAKER_03]: down to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in back in the day, as far as like
ones that got advertised, there was pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: much one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was the high times cannabis cup held
in Amsterdam, you know, and that cup had a
[SPEAKER_03]: major impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably it's, you know, the most
impactful one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that was a real nice issue at high
times.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cannabis cup winners would have
like, there'd be pages of really high
[SPEAKER_03]: quality gloss, you know, for, you know,
nice pictures, write-ups, the whole bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it kind of drove seed sales
and desirability, especially in the,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a big deal to win cups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you agree?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seed sales were kind of dependent
on that on the these cups that were going
[SPEAKER_05]: on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most of the people that were entering
those first cannabis cups were dealing in
[SPEAKER_05]: seed sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, most people's first images that
they ever saw of any kind of AK 47 or big
[SPEAKER_03]: bud or white widow, or, you know,
a lot, you can name a lot of different
[SPEAKER_03]: strains where like probably the first time
you ever saw it was pictures and high
[SPEAKER_03]: times in the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, the cannabis cup so
prestigious in a lot of people's minds,
[SPEAKER_05]: like at least in the general publics,
that when a lot of us get into growing,
[SPEAKER_05]: when we first go to buy our first pack of
seeds, the one thing we think about,
[SPEAKER_05]: has it won a high times cannabis cup?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause most of us know, even with basic
smoking knowledge, when you jump into
[SPEAKER_05]: this, that there is a magazine called high
times and that they have an event called
[SPEAKER_05]: the cannabis cup and that there are
winners of these things, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's a lot of people's first
entrance is, is who has won the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: cups when they get into growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was kind of one of those things
too, where Amsterdam at the time was one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the few places in the world where you
could gather openly with a weed festival.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it brought together a bunch of heads
from all over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was some, there was some weird
stuff about it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was people that thought that people
that went there were watched.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were worried about a bunch of
gathering of growers and seed makers and
[SPEAKER_03]: hustlers and stuff because, you know,
it was heavily under prohibition at the
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was big agencies in Europe and
America, like wanting to know what was
[SPEAKER_03]: going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's even a bunch of drama about
the, the cup has always had some weird
[SPEAKER_03]: politics.
[SPEAKER_03]: But from a cannabis perspective and
certainly from like a younger smokers
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective, it's safe to say that a lot
of people would get that issue of high
[SPEAKER_03]: times and drool over the multi-page photo
shoot of the winners and the entries and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, some of the,
and in fact too, some of the late 80s
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, you know, it's so old now that it's
reference points for some of those early
[SPEAKER_03]: strains and photos of those early strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and the, I don't think we've
mentioned it yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first cup was held in 1988,
correct?
[SPEAKER_05]: 87 or 88.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it might've been 88.
[SPEAKER_03]: 87.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so too, because the first high
times 87 one was skunk one, but it listed
[SPEAKER_05]: here is 88.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to say on the front cover of
high times, it was the red issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to say it was 87, but I might
be wrong, right?
Wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we learned something recently
here about the second cup winner,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is the early Pearl skunk one on
lights five Hayes, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that one, that one's gone through
a metamorphosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when that got released at one,
the 89 cannabis cup overall, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what Neville sold it at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what he entered it at.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then a couple of years later,
he changed the name to silver Pearl by
[SPEAKER_03]: Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was the same mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: He listed the mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just changed the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could still read exactly what it
was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when Sensi bought out his
company, they just changed it to silver
[SPEAKER_03]: Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they took away most of the information
of what was in the hybrid itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just a name and a vague
description.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they mentioned that it won the 89 cup.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Neville helpfully laid out what the
mix was.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's it went from a I mean,
I can't even remember how it was written.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it like EP by skunk one by NL five by
Hayes?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's not a very great marketing name.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the best marketing name.
[SPEAKER_03]: At all.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Neville got rid of that and called it,
you know, and called that strange silver
[SPEAKER_03]: Pearl.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to move this thing so we can see
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you can see the screen
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be too tiny for you to see,
huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too tiny for me to see, but you can
walk me through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Third cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Northern Lights five from the seed
bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Classic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe I'll throw in a little tidbit
about that, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are several pictures from various
people that Matt and I have gathered of
[SPEAKER_03]: living flowering plants well and well
close to harvest and dried flower of that
[SPEAKER_03]: exact famous NL five cut.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so without you know, because it won,
it got the full photo spread and it got
[SPEAKER_03]: some pictures and it gave us a reference
point 35 years later or whatever for what
[SPEAKER_03]: that exactly looked like.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's more to the story,
like even more because if that Neville's
[SPEAKER_05]: if that in all five that won the cup
wasn't the same and all five that was
[SPEAKER_05]: shipped over.
[SPEAKER_05]: In that little terrarium, whatever
terrarium type situation, then referencing
[SPEAKER_05]: the the Seattle and all five seed line to
that specific cut would be a little
[SPEAKER_05]: confusing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, there's it's one of those
things where Matt and I, you think you
[SPEAKER_03]: have something like that figured out and
nuance comes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, they.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even exactly sure what to say that
I won, but this that different people have
[SPEAKER_03]: different perspectives and remember
things, you know, and even today,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the history history is gets it gets
altered, perhaps is the best way to put
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be fluid.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be fluid.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be fluid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, you think you understand
something and then something comes along
[SPEAKER_03]: that that kind of flips that on its head.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Matt and I recently got some
credence that like maybe, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we had heard a long time ago that one of
the NL's might have been and Steve
[SPEAKER_03]: Murphy's Afghan mixed with a Neville
Afghan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and Seattle Greg in a post a long time
ago even sort of confirmed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then all the other evidence came out
against it and it kind of dropped and we
[SPEAKER_03]: never heard it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, recently we heard that that was
probably true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That it's a pretty it's a decent,
reliable source that would know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely a close in and reliable
source.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's it's kind of a lot of a
lot of this old oral history.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to lean into what you believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what Matt was referencing is that we
believe that there was two famous NL five
[SPEAKER_03]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one that was a little bit more
sativa that was passed around the Pacific
[SPEAKER_03]: Northwest and Seattle Greg's crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was one that Neville found out
of NL five labeled seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That Greg sent him that he thought was a
total Afghan throwback and exhibited no
[SPEAKER_03]: sativa influence that he could discern
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And supposedly this one mother cut became
the winner of all that and went on to
[SPEAKER_03]: become famous and got bred to all kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Supposedly, I think I think the story is
that he crossed that to that NL five cut
[SPEAKER_05]: to either Afghani one or that Mazar,
you know, and then that something was
[SPEAKER_05]: selected from that and that became the NL
five cut that won the cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's that's something to clarify.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if we ever speak misspeak on anything
and we get, you know, any future info,
[SPEAKER_05]: we'll always update it as best we can
without throwing anyone under the bus or
[SPEAKER_05]: doing anything crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we like to make sure that we get
everything as accurate as possible,
[SPEAKER_05]: no matter what, even if it is us being
wrong at one point.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_05]: What one next?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are at let's see here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are at Skunk from Free City.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I assume it's like a skunk one,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who Free City is.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't either.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we have Hayes Skunk one from
Homegrown Fantasies or Homegrown Fantasy,
[SPEAKER_05]: which became Homegrown Fantasies later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it says Hive Times Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why it says that beside it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hindu Kush across the skunk one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I wonder if that was I wonder if
that was pot of gold.
Hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if that name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it say did it say did what did it say
again?
[SPEAKER_05]: It says Hayes Skunk one from Homegrown
Fantasy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then in parentheses, it says Hive Times
Cannabis Cup winner master Kush equal
[SPEAKER_05]: Hindu Kush x Skunk one.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then below it, it says Hayes.
[SPEAKER_05]: The 1993 is Hayes Northern Lights five
percent seed bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it says the same thing next to
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hive Times Cannabis Cup winner master Kush
equals Hindu Kush across the skunk one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know why they're putting that's
confusing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, once you get once you get to 30
or 94, you get to Jack Herrer.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's 95.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're wrong, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: White Widows 95.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I I went to that cup when I was when I
was my huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Which cup was it the 94 Cup for Jack
Herrer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the jack the one because because what
they did is that cup that was that was one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the first times I went out to get
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd gone that summer previously,
but I went back in fall and they they
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted to dedicate that whole the whole
theme of the Cannabis Cup was around Jack
[SPEAKER_03]: Herrera and his and his contributions to
Canada's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had speeches by various people and
all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's special limited edition posters,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have a few.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, one of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my promise to Bacalolo.
[SPEAKER_05]: I promised one away already.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they really they really tried to ramp
up marketing then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they wanted to release something
that was named after him for that cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Neville had been working on this NL
five Hayes by Skunk Hayes project,
[SPEAKER_03]: but he didn't really feel like it was
ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the drunkers convinced him to release
it and they released it at the Cup and it
[SPEAKER_03]: was called Jack Herrera after the theme of
the Cup.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then and then Neville kept working
that line and three or four years later,
[SPEAKER_03]: he re released it and proved as he thought
as Super Silver Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I was at that that Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I'll say about the the the these
cups is from a personal level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to like three of them and it was
definitely my least favorite time of being
[SPEAKER_03]: in Amsterdam because late it was usually
in late November and Amsterdam's cold that
[SPEAKER_03]: time of year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it could be sleeting or icy rain or
it's freezing and then you're in these
[SPEAKER_03]: coffee shops and like and they're super
crowded and most of the best weed is being
[SPEAKER_03]: hoarded for all of the dignitaries and
like famous people and various folk coming
[SPEAKER_03]: in to smoke weed for the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for a normal person, it was like
crowded cold and it was harder to find
[SPEAKER_03]: good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was still cool to see and they did
just like at they did we were just
[SPEAKER_03]: describing they did usually drop big name
seed drops at the Cup itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it got a lot of free press.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody was there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I did find recently in an old
article, it was the the year bubblegum won
[SPEAKER_05]: the Cannabis Cup and it was in an old
article in high times.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were interviewing Tony from Sager
Matha and he was the one who entered it in
[SPEAKER_05]: for the gray area and it was actually
bubble berry that he entered in his
[SPEAKER_05]: bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I saw that and that I was like,
what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So apparently sometimes what is entered in
and named is necessarily what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to clarify that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be clarified, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people you know, there's Neville
would say that, you know, the same cut
[SPEAKER_03]: that he had of, you know, got one of NL
five skunk haze got like four or five
[SPEAKER_03]: different names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've seen that out west a bunch to
fast forward a bunch of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what happened, I think, is by the by
the early to mid 90s, the Cannabis Cup
[SPEAKER_03]: became a big vehicle for selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Matt was about to talk about what
is it 95 like the year after it's when
[SPEAKER_03]: White Widow won.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks like by 1995, Greenhouse Seeds
started smashing the butthole out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have 95 White Widow, 96, White Russian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: 97 was Peacemaker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we got 98 SSH, Silver Haze,
99.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Super Silver Haze again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then 2000 all the something all the
sudden something weird happens and we have
[SPEAKER_05]: Blueberry winning a cup as it should,
as it should always win every cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't you forget it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's that was a departure from the
normal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what should be mentioned is that at the
time, White Widow, White Rhino Peacemaker,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is Great White Shark and Super
Silver Haze all came out of the same shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was all out of Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: The White family was stuffed getting
released by Shanti Baba.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Haze was stuffed getting released
by Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Greenhouse, I think they swept.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they placed top for five,
six years in a row.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it got pretty ridiculous,
you know, and for different things,
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were lots of accusations during that
time of purchased cups and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, there were heavy arguments
that it was only done on merit during
[SPEAKER_05]: those years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and to be real, they had some of
the most accomplished breeders in history
[SPEAKER_05]: working for them at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they didn't necessarily have to buy
cups to win.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the people around them were using
F2s or, you know, different filial
[SPEAKER_05]: generations or hybrids there of the work
established by the people who are winning
[SPEAKER_05]: the cups.
[SPEAKER_05]: So by that point, I don't know that it was
necessarily something we can go,
[SPEAKER_05]: aha, it was already corrupt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, the with the White family,
that's sort of the proof is in the pudding
[SPEAKER_03]: in the sense that it started winning cups
in the mid 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was one of the most common breeding
tools for the next decade.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The amount of people that bred with white
widow or white white rhino or great white
[SPEAKER_03]: shark or any of those white family things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think that, you know,
I've mentioned before that, like when I
[SPEAKER_03]: first went to like some of Ron's harvest
parties and stuff, things by white widow
[SPEAKER_03]: are one of the most common things you
would find.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just it just became a huge family.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in that regard, I don't, you know,
and Super Silver Haze did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do think there was politics,
but I think there was a crew there that
[SPEAKER_03]: had significantly better weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just sort.
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, Neville, you know,
I mean, Shanti came in with the white
[SPEAKER_03]: family late, but Neville pretty much
dominated the 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: To a large degree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah, everything except 88 was
skunk one and 91 up until the white widow
[SPEAKER_05]: in 95 was Neville.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like Neville had this had this
big run and then Neville and Shanti joined
[SPEAKER_03]: forces and then the stuff they released
together under greenhouse had a big run.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also think, too, that like,
I mean, because it did for me,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you'd go to you'd go to Holland
and you try to buy those seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So by after the year that blueberry won
the cup, we have a new entrant for the the
[SPEAKER_05]: the king of the crown, which is dairy from
Barney's farm with sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember the sweet tooth?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some Breeder Steve work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a blueberry sweet pink grapefruit,
if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there was this there was a
fino sweet to three.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say in that in that era,
probably the three or four most common
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders as far as like New School was
like there was the white family from
[SPEAKER_03]: Shanti.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was the blue family from DJ.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there was there was stuff from
Spice of Life, which we were just talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of work being put out
right then by Breeder Steve.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, his his Louie Legends Ultimate
Indica, his blockhead, his sweet tooth and
[SPEAKER_03]: probably probably even the first the first
edition of of Brothers Grimm was right
[SPEAKER_03]: around that era, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to give props to the real breeder
of Legends Ultimate Indica.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's my boy, Red Red.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to if you want to check out
Red, we have an interview with him and
[SPEAKER_05]: Chimera weighs back a few of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was I mean, there's always been a
there's always been a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes the person that releases the
seed line is the actual breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many times they're the aggregator.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're the person that was willing to
take seeds from someone else and go public
[SPEAKER_03]: with them in some fashion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and a lot of breeders are a mix
of the two.
[SPEAKER_03]: They made some things themselves and they
got some things from other people and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and they went that way that
route.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would say that, yeah, I mean,
it was one it became one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_03]: drivers of of sales of seeds and
popularity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like kind of an event thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you didn't buy High Times every
month, if you were a stoner, you probably
[SPEAKER_03]: bought the High Times Cannabis Cup issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say in that era.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there during this time when Blueberry
started winning, because for two years it
[SPEAKER_05]: was blueberry stuff that won.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was some alleged alleged maybe we
should say alleged people getting caught
[SPEAKER_05]: and banned from participating in the Cup
for a few years after Shanti and Neville
[SPEAKER_05]: disappeared.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe our young our little buddy,
this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I mean, they that's that's kind
of an interesting story in the sense that
[SPEAKER_03]: Greenhouse Seeds is was a partnership
between Neville Shanti and Arjun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was several very cool coffee shops
to visit in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and they sold some of the best
flour in the in the spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had they were the exclusive spot
to get Neville and Shanti work after
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville left Sensi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for five or six years there,
they kind of ruled the roost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think eventually Shanti and Neville
chafed under sort of being like the back
[SPEAKER_03]: end, but still had to be in the shadows a
bit while Arjun was the face.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they decided to break off and do their
own thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shanti first and then Neville a year
later.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after Neville's experiences at Sensi,
when he partnered at Greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_03]: he did not let any seeds or breeding stock
or anything like that be controlled by
[SPEAKER_03]: Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: They kept that in house themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when they so they provided Greenhouse
with a bunch of flour and a bunch of seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: to sell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when they left, that left Greenhouse
a real issue because it was the biggest
[SPEAKER_03]: seed bank at the seed company at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had been winning awards for five or six
years in a row.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had all these unique lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was crushing the competition and all of
a sudden it didn't have any breeding stock
[SPEAKER_03]: or any or any in-house breeders.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that's when Franco got
hired.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I have no idea when Franco came in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe he came in after Neville and
Shanti left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he wouldn't have been there when
they were there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he worked for Greenhouse and they
ended up using a bunch of Greenhouse seed
[SPEAKER_03]: that they had to do pheno hunts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they started making a bunch of Arjun's
haze one, Arjun's super lemon haze,
[SPEAKER_03]: all these different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we believe that they actually got
banned from competition for a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: For trying to tilt the scales in their
favor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was a few years, Van,
actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might have been a few.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was at least one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, at least one.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it went to show that what he really
wanted, obviously, was he really wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: win some cups after his stars left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a big financial thing, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from 2001 to fricking 2012,
I'm trying to watch my language.
[SPEAKER_05]: So fricking 2012, it is a head-to-head
show.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a long time between Dairy at
Barney's and Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are basically having Cannabis Cup
winners with Morning Glory, whatever the
[SPEAKER_05]: hell that is, a Hawaiian Snow,
which was whatever they were selling that
[SPEAKER_05]: month as Hawaiian Snow.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Amnesia Haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Willie Nelson, not made by Dairy
from Barney's farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Arjun's Ultra Haze, number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: God knows.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have G13 Haze, I believe, from who made
it?
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Neville, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Neville, originally, maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think he gave it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he gave some to Soma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone did, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that goes to show right there
that there was probably a 15-year,
[SPEAKER_03]: 18-year period where the Cannabis Cups and
High Times in Holland were the epicenter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the epicenter shifts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're talking right around that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking early 2000s, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2001 to 2012.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now we start getting some of the
early Emerald Cups in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we start getting some more activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: The forums and things had changed things a
whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people were communicating in different
ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could buy and trade seeds on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Amsterdam started not becoming the
primary destination that people flew to to
[SPEAKER_03]: get seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could get it from Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could get it from local, different
folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could get it from DMing people on
Overgrow or Cannabis World or ICMAG,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when you were first coming out,
who was big on the forum selling seed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who was big on the forum selling seed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Vic High.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the end of the Vic High era.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything was like Space Queen,
Widow, something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, JoJo was big.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dutch Flowers had just started or ended.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who else is big during that time?
[SPEAKER_05]: Brothers Grimm had already ended.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Spice Brothers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who else?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's that other dude?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was another guy that did all like
Brothers Grimm repros.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I did a bunch of Apollo 11.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stuff like that was real big.
[SPEAKER_05]: And TGA had just started making their
name.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and those are all, for the most part,
non-Holland based situations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: About that time, Joey Weed, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think about that time I had been hit to
the whole market.
[SPEAKER_05]: By about 2007, 2008, I had already been
hit to the whole fact that the market had
[SPEAKER_05]: been moved, that everything that the Dutch
were selling was probably made in Spain
[SPEAKER_05]: and not exactly what they would have been
selling, say, even 10 years prior.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also fair to mention that in 1999 or
so, maybe it was 2000, they changed the
[SPEAKER_03]: laws in the Netherlands, where before you
were allowed to legally grow cannabis to
[SPEAKER_03]: make seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they changed it and they closed
that loophole.
[SPEAKER_03]: And around that time, a lot of the
traditional seed seed companies in Holland
[SPEAKER_03]: got raided.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And genetics were lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And no, everyone's been very tight lipped
about that era.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we know since he got visited,
we know Sirius Seeds got visited.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know Tony from Sag Martha got busted so
bad he shut down for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of rolled through.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some nuance of all that stuff moving to
Spain or and or Switzerland is all of a
[SPEAKER_03]: sudden, Holland became unfriendly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sadly, people lost some stock,
some mother stock and some father stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and things got mixed up and
there was great financial pressure to not
[SPEAKER_03]: admit what you'd lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's kind of like we kind of trust
Sensi in the 90s and increasingly not as
[SPEAKER_03]: the 2000s went on.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: As Neville had less to do with Greenhouse
and Sensi, I think a lot changed and it
[SPEAKER_05]: became very obvious.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was mostly because, I mean,
there's only so many people that really
[SPEAKER_05]: take everything so serious when it comes
to genetics and being that anal about
[SPEAKER_05]: getting everything right the way it's
supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only a few that have ever existed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you could probably say that
sometime in the early 2000s, the high
[SPEAKER_03]: times Cannabis Cup after sort of like a 15
year run of dominance really started
[SPEAKER_03]: losing pizzazz and like the capturing the
imagination of Stoners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we, you know, 215 and in
Colorado and there was different things
[SPEAKER_03]: that were going on in America at the time
where things were starting to loosen and
[SPEAKER_03]: open up more and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the epicenter of interest shifted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say the first Emerald Cup was
probably in the early 2003 or four.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had to guess, I would say within a
year or two of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it started at Area 101 in Mendo,
which is a little ways north of
[SPEAKER_03]: Leightonville.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a property Tim Blake owns.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he threw events there for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember exactly when it grew.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's kind of like what shifted is
cups sort of went through a lull of not
[SPEAKER_03]: being all that important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think they probably had a
resurgence when the West Coast medical
[SPEAKER_03]: cups started growing in popularity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Emerald Cup, when the Emerald Cup
especially got bigger, high times started
[SPEAKER_03]: throwing instead of having one cup a year,
they started having how many?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at first they were doing like,
like a high times Cup, California,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then they would do high times
California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember the first year Denver had
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it became like high times.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd have California one once or twice a
year would be California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once or twice a year would be Denver.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you'd also start adding in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it became like three times each,
you know, each state each year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it just became a shit show of,
you know, however many year I couldn't
[SPEAKER_05]: even keep count anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that so that thing dramatically
changed it from like going from sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: like a once a year event.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fairly short to turning it into
sort of like a circuit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a circuit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that being that it was a circuit,
it morphed from instead of it just being
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of like a collection of people
gathering and a competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it grew this little economy all
around it as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of these cups, it would be a gray
area in these states where you could go
[SPEAKER_03]: and you could see a bunch of growers
flower and you could buy directly from
[SPEAKER_03]: small breeders, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it became a way for industry people
to see each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to meet the public.
For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: That really was what it became to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: For a while, I think it was pretty
special.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think a lot of people thought it was
pretty special.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like not just not just on the business
level, like a lot of us would make most of
[SPEAKER_05]: our money for the year at Emerald Cup,
but on a level where you get to see a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of the people that you grew up looking up
to in this business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of times you'd get to have
dinner with them and you'd end up finding
[SPEAKER_05]: a peer as opposed to someone you just look
up to.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was it was a wild time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was it was definitely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then it became multilayered in the
sense that you could kind of turn some of
[SPEAKER_03]: those events into what you wanted them to
be.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were super into the competition,
you could stay in those areas and focus on
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you wanted to stay in the
area where you were going to meet a bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: of breeders and growers and industry types
and various people that would gather,
[SPEAKER_03]: you could just kind of use it to rub
shoulders and network and chat and see
[SPEAKER_03]: people in person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's where a lot of clandestine people
decided to start showing their faces.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's true, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so it's where you could go and
decide I'm going to punch Matt Ryan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a popular choice, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go to Emerald Cup and I want
to punch Matt right in the face.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I don't want to forget is for
some of the old timers, the nugs and jugs,
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to talk about some of that
real quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we cover it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we haven't.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't mentioned it at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: We kind of honestly, we just started
talking about like the lack of cultural
[SPEAKER_03]: impact that the cannabis cups from high
times had hit by the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we just started riffing on their
replacements.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we really didn't go into depth beyond
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, let's hit nugs and jugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's one of those special small
events that not a lot of people know about
[SPEAKER_05]: that existed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you chat on it for a minute?
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't around for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nugs and jugs?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, some of them we've almost done
like halfway whole episodes on,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like Ron's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those would be considered like harvest
parties or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was a lot separate from like the
Emerald Cups and the stuff that was so
[SPEAKER_03]: blatant.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's invite only cups.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there was invite only gatherings
that had no cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just a way for, you know,
dozens of of characters from our world to
[SPEAKER_03]: safely meet up and swap stories and seeds
and plants and clones and weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was where a lot of like
little people's private interests started
[SPEAKER_03]: blending.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was an era to before.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was before anyone was worried about
personal rep because that was so fleeting
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was still dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was the kind of thing where I'd go
to a harvest festival and this dude would
[SPEAKER_03]: give me, you know, a hundred seeds of Blue
Widow by Suite 23.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this person would give me 50.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were just excited that you wanted
to take seeds of their work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so there was a lot of trading
that went on amongst the amateurs and
[SPEAKER_03]: enthusiasts and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were all the stuff we mentioned
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a new wave of breeders that had
followings.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people were all excited about
Breeder Steve.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and, you know, Brothers Grimm and,
you know, DJ Short with all the blueberry
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff right then was exploding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, all the white stuff was
popular because it added frost and density
[SPEAKER_03]: to almost anything you added it to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, and there was people
going over to Switzerland and seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: Breeder Steve or seeing Shanti.
[SPEAKER_03]: So nothing like a little in-person chat to
make a fan base.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's what some of the cups
became, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was you could go and meet your Breeder
and talk to them in person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there would be lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you remember this is kind of late
in the Emerald Cup, but our buddy Bodhi
[SPEAKER_03]: was famous for not being there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Being there and not being there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first year that he had an actual
booth, I mean, it was there was like a 75
[SPEAKER_03]: yard line for a day and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember what he was doing that day?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the first time he showed up,
he was he was he was like getting in
[SPEAKER_05]: costumes and getting in his own line and
like standing next to people and like
[SPEAKER_05]: talking to them about his own stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they didn't even know they were
talking to him and then like walk up and
[SPEAKER_05]: sell seeds real fast and they freak out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he would.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was clever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it was that year or the
next year, but he brought he got this a
[SPEAKER_03]: hold of this enormous stack of original
1985 Neville Seed Bank catalogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that came from Clyde.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it came from Clyde.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just remember he walked around.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had this big pack, you know,
this big side bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he just all do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All every good friend got a couple of
copies of Neville's first catalog that he
[SPEAKER_05]: put in a closet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Santa Claus did probably some like weird
tobacco seeds and some some crazy Indian
[SPEAKER_03]: sativas that he had gathered or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfumes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was perfume.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just the kind of neat thing that
you can do because it was like it's it's
[SPEAKER_03]: almost weird in the sense that all day
long, you know, customers and fans get to
[SPEAKER_03]: hang out and get to go meet the people and
ask questions and buy seeds direct from
[SPEAKER_03]: that person and know you're not getting
scammed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after all that, in between all
that at night, like a bunch of the friends
[SPEAKER_03]: that are doing all that kind of stuff,
get to actually see one another in person.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, that's kind of what our
parties formed out of was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: we would all be at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd all be like headed there anyways.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we would try to like make time for
each other during the day when we're doing
[SPEAKER_05]: these transactions.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we would get so bogged down,
especially in the later years,
[SPEAKER_05]: that we didn't have time to even talk to
each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just we just be like, all right,
next year, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so at the end, we were just like,
fuck it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just gonna have to set aside a full
night for partying after where we can all
[SPEAKER_05]: hang out away from everyone and just
chill.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, you know, like it just naturally
evolves sometimes that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was kind of like one of those
old harvest harvest parties of old,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, where a bunch of people bring a
lot of nice weed and they set it on the
[SPEAKER_03]: table.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a bunch of chatting and eating
and smoking and hanging out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's there's cool parts
about that, obviously, like with the
[SPEAKER_03]: Emerald Cup and the high times and a lot
of the stuff that started happening on the
[SPEAKER_03]: West Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It became again like it was in the
beginning with the high times festivals in
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: It became again like a prestige money
making important thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people would put a lot of effort into
winning because they wanted to advertise
[SPEAKER_03]: that they had won, you know, and all the
shadiness came in like there was there was
[SPEAKER_03]: a little remain nameless, but there was
some clubs that would just hold back the
[SPEAKER_03]: nicest weed and hash they bought all year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then enter it under their own label.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's that's a move like how are
you going to prove it wasn't grown by then
[SPEAKER_03]: you walk into their thing and they've got
all these medals of all the shit that
[SPEAKER_03]: they've won.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at all the good weed that's been in
our store.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got all these different metals,
you know, and and, you know, hash makers
[SPEAKER_03]: winning a bunch of medals, flour makers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like it's it's free hardware.
[SPEAKER_03]: It like makes you maybe it makes it easier
to sell in dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it gets people asking about your
seeds, maybe this and that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as a result of that, it went from,
you know, harvest festivals that like
[SPEAKER_03]: they're totally non economic way or just a
way for a bunch of weed nerds to conduct
[SPEAKER_03]: business, make friends and exchange.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then there's also this commerce aspect
where it's like winning is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and so that's where the that's
where some bullshit comes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where room and, you know,
weed people aren't the most like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, there's plenty of non ethics
that goes into something that's like
[SPEAKER_03]: unregulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's lots of rumors about how
real or how not certain cops have been
[SPEAKER_03]: over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people that win want to tout
their shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: People that don't win want to be like,
it was fucking rigged.
[SPEAKER_03]: This person's friends or family are
related or this is happening or da da da
[SPEAKER_03]: da da da or they paid for it or there was
money exchanged or you don't know how it
[SPEAKER_03]: works.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's there's probably
some fire there with the smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no point in talking about
individual aspects, but there were so many
[SPEAKER_03]: of them and there was so much money at
stake.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems silly to think that there wasn't
some you know, it wasn't just purely
[SPEAKER_03]: altruistic, double blind studies,
dispassionately deciding which weed is
[SPEAKER_03]: best.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely not double blinded any of these
events, even when you try.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I told you about this earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't say which event it was,
but there was an event me and another
[SPEAKER_05]: person spent making.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was originally going to be called the
Breeders Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were just going to invite breeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the idea was breeders had to enter in
their own weed that they grew.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was still they're still in an honor
principle involved with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they just had to present it,
you know, that that idea was expanded on
[SPEAKER_05]: and taken for another cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went to that event and it seemed
cool and everything, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody was chilling.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was one thing nobody accounted
for with all these rules that we thought
[SPEAKER_05]: we had accounted for everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone brought a green jar that was green
glass and clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: And any time that jar was going around to
the different tables, they always knew
[SPEAKER_05]: where it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was supposed to be double blind.
[SPEAKER_05]: So nobody knew whose weed was which.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like supposedly nobody had a green jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when it came by your when your own
weed came by and you knew it was your own
[SPEAKER_05]: weed, you had the honor system saying,
hey, this is mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to vote on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, suppliers of green jars voted on
green jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was a lot of shit like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even when there's things you can't
account for.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think that they brought the
green jar there just to like purposely do
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just is something that that organically
happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like, wait, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have an advantage here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know which one's ours and green jar won
the cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was one there was a lot of
money to be made in that era.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember like the whole like DNA
Crockett partnership.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was certain years of Emerald Cup on
Friday and Saturday where they would have
[SPEAKER_03]: like a four way booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would just have a line spidering off
it in every direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody was after Tangi and double
banana Tangi and this and that and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, but I mean, it was like,
you know, there was certain if you were a
[SPEAKER_03]: hot seed company leading into that show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be a huge windfall.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, for example, like with what you're
saying right now, during those years,
[SPEAKER_05]: the DNA and Crockett entered that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was laying out tons of Calio and Banana
OG stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, Banana OG was the basis for most
of my breeding program during that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it didn't matter because I didn't have
the prestige.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have any of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Crockett.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody knew who the hell Crockett was
before they popped up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the second DNA picked them up to the
top because it was in all the high times
[SPEAKER_05]: magazines.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of a sudden they were saying,
well, we have this banana.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's in high times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just flew.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're not even kidding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there were lines out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had always been available ever since
Oregon Kid had put it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone was releasing Banana OG something
ever since that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was as if it had never existed
before.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second entered high times and the hype
had struck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I also think to tie into like the
marketing and the push aspect of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think they were smart in the sense
that they in the 215 era, they grew green.
[SPEAKER_03]: They grew some greenhouses of their work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they got professional
photographers to come in and just take
[SPEAKER_03]: absolutely gorgeous shots of their weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and some of their weed was very
photogenic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and you couldn't tell who was
going to get you high, obviously,
[SPEAKER_03]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they drove sales with a lot of ad
copy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Instagram, you know, weed people
weren't ready to be marketed to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the popularity in weed used to
happen organically and in small groups and
[SPEAKER_03]: spreading from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talk about this ad nauseam every
episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like that's another example of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that is that, you know, I mean,
when I'll give another example,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, when when Skittles was hard to
get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the vast majority of people that
was going to get after it could only get
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you take somebody that had it
like dying green seeds at the time or
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would they would have a huge line
for that first two days of Emerald Cup,
[SPEAKER_03]: all selling three hundred to five hundred
dollar packs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly five hundred of reg seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out the door.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like, bam, crazy because people were
after it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like Matt mentioned, you know,
if you market your stuff the right way,
[SPEAKER_03]: a few of those events could take care of
you for the whole year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was big.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was big.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it became so much more than a like
the the winning of the cups was important
[SPEAKER_03]: for sort of bragging rights and a
different way to market.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other part of it was just sort of
this gray area seed swap, every kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: act.
[SPEAKER_03]: All you had to do was buy a booth and have
a few permits and you could do all kinds
[SPEAKER_03]: of crazy sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you have to since 2018, you have to be
licensed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That has to be through disposed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's far more regulated and controlled.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the era that Matt is talking about
fondly, it literally was sort of like a
[SPEAKER_05]: weed swap meet open air cowboy market.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun sharing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, here's a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I've got six different eight different
jars of my different strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to smell the line I'm selling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what I'm selling.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to grab people by their fucking
jacket and drag them across the floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody gives a **** Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to uh I mean, Matt and I actually
used to joke that we could have like uh
[SPEAKER_03]: charity boxing matches at Emerald at
Emerald Cup where everyone could settle
[SPEAKER_03]: all their beefs or not or make up,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you just disappeared.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me still?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your picture went kaput.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why it went kaput.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, right here and selected blah blah
blah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead and keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, um so Emerald Cup and those and
and some of those high times especially in
[SPEAKER_03]: Southern California for crews down there,
it became a place to regularly see other
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It became a place where growers and seed
makers and various industry people could
[SPEAKER_03]: meet up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um now it's like I'm split.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um anyway, they in my opinion,
um you know, a lot of people went and it
[SPEAKER_03]: was sort of totally irrelevant that there
was a competition going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh you know, they they went to just uh
they went to get seeds or they went to
[SPEAKER_03]: meet certain people or they went to see
and be seen um or just you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to walk around and and see what
who was developing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There he's back.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Booths, all kinds of stuff and so there
was a very cool I would say like raw
[SPEAKER_03]: capitalistic freedom to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was something special and that
era is not here anymore but also you know
[SPEAKER_03]: what else is interesting is we could bring
something up that I find kind of cool is
[SPEAKER_03]: that the first all the first cups uh when
we first started getting like real testing
[SPEAKER_03]: imperfect as it may be uh I remember there
was only four or five strains that tested
[SPEAKER_03]: in the high twenties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like literally it was like there was a
couple examples of Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh there was uh huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a sense of star.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sense of star and a headband and that was
basically it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the first five or six years that there
was testing with cups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we started to see test creep
where all these numbers and all these
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes and all these THC percentages
started climbing and we used to joke that
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, there was one or two things in
the 30% club.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then fast forward five years and
there's dozens of things in the 30% club.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know and people started breeding
by numbers because they wanted to show
[SPEAKER_03]: high numbers in the dispensary and they
wanted to show high numbers in the
[SPEAKER_03]: competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I I watched someone claim 50% the other
day on the reg.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's still happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would even say I I don't know
about people listening or whatever but for
[SPEAKER_03]: my strangely for me, I would say that the
not all of it but the vast majority of my
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite weed tends to come in between 18
and 25%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some exceptions but it it a lot of
it falls in that range.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I find a lot of the 30% club to have
boring and not very long lasting highs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, despite I mean, I mean,
maybe they're potent in the sense or maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: they wash well, you know, and they yield
well but I don't find that like you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that all these 30% plus are
revolutionizing cannabis and making these
[SPEAKER_03]: older, lower, weaker things irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just reminds me of the the old article
from 1982 and I want to say it was Arthur
[SPEAKER_05]: Connoisseur who I think is someone I'm not
going to say who because he's never
[SPEAKER_05]: publicly said who he is but he was
referring to in 1982 to ban the Indica.
[SPEAKER_05]: He felt that the Indica was going to ruin
cannabis and that it was going to dumb
[SPEAKER_05]: down good weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Indica, Afghans, Pakistanis tend to be
what shot that that that percentage spike
[SPEAKER_05]: up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, maybe they were just
Nostradamus, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We we've chatted about that before too but
yeah, um most of the sativas they were
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking were bred for smoking flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Indica's were bred for harvesting
resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, and the and the and the two
things are very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they didn't care about
burnability with with you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghani or Pakistani.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't care about like and they cared
about the hatch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flower was just a carrier and so I
think a lot of I think a lot of that stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: got worked into weed due to you know,
police pressure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, flowering times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does seem there was a lot of 70s
and early 80s people in the heads that did
[SPEAKER_03]: not like the effects that the Indicas were
bringing to the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They appreciated the earlier flowering
times and the chunkiness and the
[SPEAKER_03]: frostiness but as far as the point of
smoking weed, how they enjoyed smoking it
[SPEAKER_03]: in joints.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them felt like it was kind of
inferior.
[SPEAKER_05]: I I think a lot of those dudes like
nowadays smoking a thing like cookies
[SPEAKER_05]: would just be that you know, if you took
that to them in that time and brought it
[SPEAKER_05]: to them, they told you motherfuckers,
you know, I really do think they would
[SPEAKER_05]: think that because now we have a heavily
inbred Kush style plant that is,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, very, very narrow in the type of
high in my opinion that it gives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, everybody responds a bit
differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, people know that I don't I
don't reach for cookie jars too often as
[SPEAKER_03]: far as like my go tos as far as what
affects me pretty well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also say that, you know,
I grew up and I'm not that young anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up in an era where like the pure
sativa era was long gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we were well into the mixed hybrids
era.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of tempting things about
Afghan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, you know, it's it's you're
trying to keep, you know, a lot of times a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of those early breeders like Neville
and stuff, they were trying to add the
[SPEAKER_03]: structure and the frost and the density
from the Afghan but keep the flavor and
[SPEAKER_03]: the the high the effect from the sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, that's why a bunch of their
Afghan breeding material was bland and low
[SPEAKER_03]: terps and boring.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They picked intentionally low terpene
plants to breed with sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they wanted the terpenes and the and
the flavors to shine from the other side
[SPEAKER_03]: of the hybrid through.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like a strategy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what it sounded like.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to expand on it yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let someone else expand on it when we
do that interview at some later date.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, it's one thing that's
very cool is that we've done whole shows
[SPEAKER_03]: on specific breeders, mostly because in
the era that they came out, there was so
[SPEAKER_03]: few of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them dominated the game.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even in the era we just talked about
with the Cubs, there was really not that
[SPEAKER_03]: many people in competition with one
another.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it came to who is breeding the actual
stuff that was supposedly winning these
[SPEAKER_05]: cups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like that era, the NBA or
whatever, where it's like there was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, 12 teams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or something, you know, where like there
wasn't that much competition amongst each
[SPEAKER_03]: other, but the competition was more
concentrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the American Cubs really made it
a democracy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think most people, you know,
Matt, CSI, you know, Shaw, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you could Swamp Boys, you go through a
whole list of people that like a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people got introduced to their stuff by
walking past their fucking booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse my French, but literally just but
just just, you know, there's a banner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're pushing through the crowd and then,
oh, there's Matt, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all that blueberry thing looks
pretty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They usually didn't see me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was kind of I'm kind of small,
so I'm usually tucked in behind.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just look behind sharing a booth of 20
people and I'd be down in there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Matt waving up from underneath.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Free apples.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Given him a wave.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt's actually standing that that seat is
just it's a fake back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is a fake back seat.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, it it it was,
you know, a lot of times I wouldn't even
[SPEAKER_03]: want to bug my friends who had boots
because people would wait all year to go
[SPEAKER_03]: talk to Caleb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they had a whole list of things
that they wanted from him and they wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: to ask him questions and like whittle it
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with, you know, there was a lot of
you could buy a booth and, oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: you sell seeds, you sell hash,
you sell tincture, you sell extract,
[SPEAKER_03]: you sell, you know, lozenges or edibles or
any like shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could go meet a bunch of customers and
and make some loop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite, my favorite Emerald Cup
story.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've told this to a bunch of people
and you probably get a kick out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably heard it a million times.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was at Emerald Cup and this guy had
emailed me beforehand and I didn't really
[SPEAKER_05]: know him too well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we had talked back and forth to the
email and asked me to put aside some
[SPEAKER_05]: clockwork orange seeds for him and a few
other things, but mostly that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he came up to my booth and he he
handed me this notepad and said it had
[SPEAKER_05]: written on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm, you know, whoever it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, this is what I came to get,
you know, and I realized, oh, he's deaf
[SPEAKER_05]: and mute or something like, OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, you know, wrote down what he got,
you know, did the exchange.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, do I get a discount?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, oh, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's a discount.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he walks away.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he comes back or no, no, before he
walks away, he goes, thank you and walks
[SPEAKER_05]: off.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, this fucking guy,
what the hell just happened?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he comes back and he asked me,
so do you want me to put the discount in
[SPEAKER_05]: the fire fund or do you want it back?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I put it in the fire fund that ended up
being Denali.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I met Denali.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I never forgot from that, from that
experience out of meeting and those days
[SPEAKER_05]: like you would meet thousands of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was really hard to have a memory
that that was like one of those ones that
[SPEAKER_05]: stood out because someone did something
fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was a it's it was a big thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cool in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that kind of like disorganized
chaos capitalism.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think sadly legalization has
stripped a lot of that like organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people that can't have a
booth there anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't even attend it anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And not I don't say that other people
shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just I don't have a purpose for going
anymore now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not involved in the same community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those people are involved and they're
going to that with their licenses and that
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously they're right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's split the weed community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people, a lot of the people that
you would want to go and see, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: people and, you know, people would use IG
and other things and they would find out,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, Matt or Caleb or this person,
they're going to this event.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be at Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be at this high times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to plan and go see them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and people would come with
specific plans, especially Emerald Cup,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it was in December.
[SPEAKER_03]: And back then, people usually had harvest
money burning in their pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was an era where a lot of people
grew seed outdoor because they wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: individual good sized plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that drove a lot of sales to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was a major aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of 25 to 50 plant victory
gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: That they wanted to grow from seed because
it was generally accepted.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could get a bigger and more vigorous
plant from seed than clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you were doing a limited number of
plants growing from seed, you could
[SPEAKER_03]: probably get more off that 25 than you
could if it was a clone plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you pick the right strains and you went
in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the other cool thing about
Emerald Cup was that it was a lot of it
[SPEAKER_05]: was a good time to get a lot of different
samples of different things I had to
[SPEAKER_05]: release that past year from different
growers that year who had grown it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they bring me samples.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I go home with shit loads of samples of
my different strains grown in all these
[SPEAKER_05]: different environments.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was just so much unique to that
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know with legalization if
there's ever going to be a time where
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody can enjoy that unless they're
all time billionaires can afford licenses
[SPEAKER_05]: and all the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't know if that'll happen again.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an old there's an old Grateful
Dead saying like, don't be sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be glad you were there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because, you know, in when we were
talking about all these first cups in the
[SPEAKER_03]: 90s and stuff, like having that kind of
open swap meat where thousands of potheads
[SPEAKER_03]: and growers and seed makers and hash
makers and all that could mix and mingle
[SPEAKER_03]: and talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, about their craft was unthinkable
back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was really unthinkable back
then.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I mentioned it before.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are definitely people that believe
that there was a little lot of DEA and
[SPEAKER_03]: other agencies scoping at a lot of those
first cups.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just thinking now, I don't know
if you could do it again, even if you like
[SPEAKER_05]: found a way to run a black market one with
all the fricking snitches in our scene.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they're just so abundant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our scene doesn't police itself for that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a too different of a time to
pull it off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't think it'll work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you could talk probably about like
certain areas of music or this or that or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, where there's certain things
that develop organically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're only there while that
persists.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you lose it, it shifts and
it's not the same as it was.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, I think in addition
to, you know, cups became really a way for
[SPEAKER_03]: because by the time that a lot of these
big cups were happening again,
[SPEAKER_03]: people were willing to show their faces
and show up.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were willing to associate
themselves with I grew this and I have
[SPEAKER_03]: this and I'm bringing pounds of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to keep it in my booth and
I'm not going to be arrested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember even being sketched one of the
first times when they, when Tim first
[SPEAKER_03]: moved it, cause I used to go to it up in,
uh, in Mendo when it was thrown up there
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was much smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember I got there on a Saturday,
the first year it was in Santa Rosa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was walking up to the front door and
there was this dude that was like all
[SPEAKER_03]: waddling past me and he was all fucking
happy as he was happy as can be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had like a box full of plants that,
you know, and it's like sticking out the
[SPEAKER_03]: top and he's like walking to his car.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had this moment of like,
uh, you know, of just having been so
[SPEAKER_03]: secret for so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, man, things are really
changing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and then you walk in,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of a sudden you're like,
especially from someone who grew,
[SPEAKER_03]: who grew up in an era where like plant
counts were very important, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, a hundred could be a five
year fan, you know, uh, mandatory minimum
[SPEAKER_03]: federal sentence and this and that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you walk into these things and there
was an era where there was clone sellers
[SPEAKER_03]: that had like 8,000 cuttings for sale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just racks, racks of them, racks of rooted
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you were like, Whoa, there,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember one year I was at a booth with
a nursery and I was selling seeds,
[SPEAKER_05]: but everybody thought that the clones
behind me were my stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember that caused so much chaos
because everybody's like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: can I get a clone of that?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that it's yours, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on this list.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: That comment you pinned, you know,
in Chicago, when I lived in Chicago,
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to make friends that had a totally
clean lifestyle drive me to the grow
[SPEAKER_03]: store.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of their license plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew a dude who would wear fucking wigs
and all kinds of costumes on the way to
[SPEAKER_05]: the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few cars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't like boxes of clones was
anything weird or we hadn't been doing
[SPEAKER_03]: that among our friends for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like you were walking down the
sidewalk in Santa Rosa.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big fairground for people that
don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a massive fairground.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just like out there, like right in
the open and the most open sidewalk and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, tons of, and there's
cotton, like you're just walking all
[SPEAKER_03]: happily down the street with a bunch of
rooted plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, Oh, weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weird like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you go in there and you're like,
man, people have tons of dabs,
[SPEAKER_03]: tons of tons of jars, tons of clones,
all kinds of stuff that if it was like in
[SPEAKER_03]: your car and you got pulled over,
it would might be a mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you were fully like medical and
legitimate and went to clubs and all that
[SPEAKER_03]: type of that, it would still be a mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was like an accepted gray area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you were on base.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Depending on where you live.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I see dudes come to my city and like
they'll be smoking a joint on the street.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's nothing because they think it's
California and you're cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is just, there's still hot places
in California where if you do that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to get nailed so fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they don't give a fuck if you have a
license or any of that, they can let you
[SPEAKER_05]: go to court and figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that, that I, uh, it w it is cool
in the sense that there was like an
[SPEAKER_03]: equilibrium at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anytime you could feel free and open
and safe in our community is a blessing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it wasn't like that for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think, um, I would say that the
Emerald cup itself probably turned into
[SPEAKER_03]: part uh, part business, part economic part
award, uh, and then a big family
[SPEAKER_03]: gathering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where all these people would come in from
all over the place from Colorado,
[SPEAKER_03]: from Washington, from Humboldt,
from Mendo, from the Bay, from LA and
[SPEAKER_03]: mingle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, cannabis has not really
been able to have conventions.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, not, not, at that point,
no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sort of doubled it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sort of like did all these different
duties, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then change too, because most of
the time the shit that was winning,
[SPEAKER_03]: it wasn't even that easy to go out and get
those and figure out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it wasn't the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was from greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was like, Oh, this person one
with sugary from some spot in Leytonville.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how to get that weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the times it was like that early
on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it, I think over time it did turn into
more of a only things winning that you
[SPEAKER_05]: could buy seeds of, because that is where
the money was directed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It definitely got more like that at the
end of the cups.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, everything, you know, everything
that's wild and free and unregulated
[SPEAKER_03]: eventually loses some of the wildness and,
and, and they start acting rationally in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of money and it, and it morphs into
different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then, you know, it becomes what
the regulations and the rules allow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's sort of like a, a cooler M G it's
like a, it's like an industry meat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much more so than like a gathering,
like a bunch of important people don't
[SPEAKER_03]: even go anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, I think it's more like an MJ biz
con and I don't see a lot of difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I mean, maybe they still do awards.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they have a separate awards event.
[SPEAKER_03]: They moved it to LA too, which is even
funnier because one of the things that was
[SPEAKER_03]: cool about Emerald cup was that it started
in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was done by people from the
triangle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And old growers from the triangle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a big family gathering.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then even when it moved to Santa Rosa,
it was still NorCal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonoma County is, is very much still,
you know, the, the, the very Southern tip
[SPEAKER_03]: of that bubble, you know, uh, but once
it's in LA and it's in a theater and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: awards, I mean, I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, they're moving with the industry
trends.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be what it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is this Emerald cup that everybody's
talking about going to going to be an LA
[SPEAKER_05]: or Santa Rosa?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it going right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where?
[SPEAKER_03]: In LA?
[SPEAKER_03]: In Santa Rosa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I didn't, they call it,
they call it, I believe it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: they call it the Emerald ball.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I've got some fucking Emerald balls
for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I do believe they have like a
separate ceremony in LA, but I,
[SPEAKER_03]: it got a little convoluted with COVID for
a few years there and not being able to
[SPEAKER_03]: have those kinds of events.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they did a separate event in LA
last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know exactly how they're going
to shake it all up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for a minute, it seemed like they were
going to abandon NorCal for LA,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was going to be kind of shitty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it does appear that they're still
throwing a party up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: How weird is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll leave names out that the owner of
Emerald cup was giving awards to his
[SPEAKER_05]: daughter, soon to be husband and smashing
all the cups with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that ever heavily debated or talked
about?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's not, uh, as we talked
about in the beginning, we were trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: avoid specific instances because,
you know, you don't want to battle over
[SPEAKER_03]: certain ground, but certainly,
um, there's whenever there's money and
[SPEAKER_03]: prestige, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And all that stuff on the lot,
reputation on the line, uh, economics on
[SPEAKER_03]: the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's why people debate whether how
legitimate any cup could be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's people that get a little
bit of inside information and decide that
[SPEAKER_03]: seems kind of sketchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, in lots of awards, uh, family members
and clients, close friends can't
[SPEAKER_03]: participate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but that's not true of cannabis
awards.
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently not.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is definitely not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and, um, you know, and so,
you know, doesn't it does, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's nepotistic things that occur
certainly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's friendships and there's beefs
and there's in crowds and out crowds and
[SPEAKER_03]: weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, I don't even know how
blind some of the blind stuff is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then even if it is blind, you have a
group of people and it's just their
[SPEAKER_03]: expression of prejudice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even, even with, with all that,
you're, you're still the honor system
[SPEAKER_05]: saying, this is this strain I'm presenting
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm, I'm pretty sure without,
I'm not going to get into specifics,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm pretty sure there was at times
some, some weed that, that was winning
[SPEAKER_03]: quite a bit that was not very pretty,
uh, that was entered into the sun grown
[SPEAKER_03]: categories and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was grown underneath, uh,
multiple nice indoor light, like
[SPEAKER_03]: supplemental indoor lighting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you have a little section that you're
growing your stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to enter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's in the greenhouse and it's got
the sun hitting it, but it's also got
[SPEAKER_03]: ceramics and some LEDs and some this and
some that, and it gets extra special
[SPEAKER_03]: sauce.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's sun grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it comes out looking like crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of a sudden it's winning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, um, because people,
we come from a culture that bends or
[SPEAKER_03]: ignores rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, people will do anything to win.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when maybe if you win,
you know, um, that, that next year,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, you find it way easier to move a lot
of your product for higher pricing and
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that next year, because you won
and all your stuff was in dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_03]: a bunch of people smoked it, you have a
crazy line out your booth for your
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was multiple, there was multiple
arcs like that where people won.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the economic interest was great
for them for two or three years after
[SPEAKER_03]: that, there was reverberations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course there's going to be that kind
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always, always, you know, that's just,
I just don't think people know,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's a, there's always the,
the announcements.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always, you know, like stuff that
surface level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's a stuff that like people
behind the scenes know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's stuff that people in
certain groups that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: or family friends of certain people were
like, how did that fly?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, fuck, I guess, you know,
it just does.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, it's not just one specific cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, even with the one that I
helped organize, and I helped find the
[SPEAKER_05]: rules for it, there were things that we
couldn't even possibly conceive of a green
[SPEAKER_05]: jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we really thought we had it all
nailed out, but there's always ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had friends, we've had friends that
have, that have judged various things and
[SPEAKER_03]: they've seen things that they didn't think
were the greatest, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you know, there's a, there's a lot
of pressure now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I think a lot of those cups,
they were making so much money renting out
[SPEAKER_03]: expensive small amounts of booths.
[SPEAKER_03]: Space to all of you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that just, just throwing them was
highly profitable for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were making millions off just the
booth space.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, you know, there was, there was
that, there was a desire to throw more and
[SPEAKER_03]: more and more of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and now with all the rules and
regulations and all that other types of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, it's taken a lot of the soul out of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also just the competition of
people that can afford licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's one more thing I want to talk
about before we, I mean, we're getting,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, is judging.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I talked about it briefly
in the Gangeer part, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: when they were talking about how they
select their judges or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed that a lot of times at even some
of these prestigious events, judging isn't
[SPEAKER_05]: necessarily based on the most skilled
people in the room at assessing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, most often that is not the case
when it comes to judging.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there, a lot of times it's people
paying, they pay for their judges pass or
[SPEAKER_05]: they're, they pay for their judges kits
where they get all kinds of extracts or
[SPEAKER_05]: buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very hard for me to understand
someone that is new to cannabis being able
[SPEAKER_05]: to have a qualified nose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, any of it really, I mean, what are you
basing your whole thing on?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another aspect too, where it's like,
it might be just a collection of industry
[SPEAKER_03]: people and people associated with the
people throwing the event.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and in some cases you're like,
oh, here's a random assortment of
[SPEAKER_03]: different kinds of stoners.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fair.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that you can buy your way in
though, blows my mind, blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's for a lot of these big extracts
cups too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like just below, buy your way into judge.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to put something in and let
some random ass kid that may have smoked
[SPEAKER_05]: twice in his life judge.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's totally unregulated and
there's no penalties and there's no
[SPEAKER_03]: outside body governing any of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all the honor system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like you said, um, I mean,
that's part of the reason why we do these
[SPEAKER_03]: shows is like, because there's a bunch of
stuff we talk about all the time that
[SPEAKER_03]: isn't well known.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of people, part of the
reason why the cups thing works so well is
[SPEAKER_03]: because for the, a lot of smokers,
they're just like, oh my God, that must be
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the best shit out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't have the nuance to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, context.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they don't have the context.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't, they don't know the characters
involved personally or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and it's not to say that like it's all
corrupt or whatever all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just people have their belief systems
and they're influenced by what they like
[SPEAKER_03]: and what they don't like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and uh, you know, and, and then,
you know, there's, there's, it's like in
[SPEAKER_03]: food, like anything that doesn't have a
legal definition, like natural.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't actually have a real meaning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an advertising meaning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, so, uh, so cannabis judging
right now is absolutely subjective.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, very much so.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, to the point of where
judge calling it judging, maybe a little
[SPEAKER_05]: stretch in a nice way of putting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other part of it is let's say that
you're totally advanced and that you are a
[SPEAKER_03]: Titan in your field and all kinds of
people respect you, you know, and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, let's just, you know, and you're,
you're in the hash game or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: and everybody loves the hash you make and
you're really good at it and you have a
[SPEAKER_03]: fine nose for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're definitely one of the people
that could be judging.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're smoking 20 dabs in five,
in, in two hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the effect of each individual dab and
like what it does to you and how it makes
[SPEAKER_03]: you feel, or even if you're smoking 20
joints in the course of a few hours of
[SPEAKER_03]: different weed and you're layering all
those effects and highs on top of each
[SPEAKER_03]: other, it's not like you're waking up in
the morning, smoking a joint of this,
[SPEAKER_03]: going about your business and really
getting a sense for what that one thing
[SPEAKER_03]: does.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so unless there are some places
that give you samples ahead of time and
[SPEAKER_03]: have you take a bunch of notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are, there are, there's also
like just back to back to back to back to
[SPEAKER_03]: back to back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then how well can you judge?
[SPEAKER_03]: I typically, when I smoke 10 or 15 kinds
of weed that I don't smoke on a daily
[SPEAKER_03]: basis, I get ripped.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just all adds up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoke a bunch of my friend's weed,
you know, and it's weed that I don't,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't smoke very often and it's all
rapid fire and I'm just joining out with
my friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: After joint, after joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I might not be the best judge
that day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, I don't know if you don't
like the way that I matched my,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, my, my clothing to this lovely chair
behind me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You did a good job matching it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of went through, you know,
there was a huge debate in my prep team,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, on, uh, you know, the designers that
you have sponsoring you, I know it's a big
[SPEAKER_03]: wide choice in your wardrobe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all the, but it really does.
[SPEAKER_03]: It accents all my face makeup,
you know, and that gives me that natural
[SPEAKER_03]: tone that I'm after.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's working well for you, son.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so yeah, I mean, so we're at one
minute or I'm sorry, one hour,
[SPEAKER_05]: 23 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll probably cut this one a little bit
short, but I wanted to, um, let everybody
[SPEAKER_05]: know we're going to be doing the show at a
different time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I mentioned briefly on Instagram,
we're going to start doing the shows on
[SPEAKER_05]: Saturdays after the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the last one on Fridays.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to start doing it Saturdays at
1 p.m.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pacific standard or whatever time Pacific
1 p.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pacific time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where the show is going to be
moving to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we were, we were kind of looking at
where everyone like YouTube gives you
[SPEAKER_05]: those like statistics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that seems to be where everybody's
watching at a good time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've noticed that people say like,
they prefer to watch it on Saturdays in
[SPEAKER_05]: their grow room.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know this is late for the East
coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially for some of our across the
country people and not just back and forth
[SPEAKER_05]: across the country all the time now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's he's he's getting old.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's getting a little old in his age.
[SPEAKER_05]: We worry about him.
[SPEAKER_05]: We worry about him staying up too late.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else you wanted to get
in on this topic?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I, uh, I think you could just
simply say that, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: cups are a little bit of humanity.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's community, um,
there's meeting with people of,
[SPEAKER_03]: of, of similar interests.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's bringing different groups together
that might not be that might not have been
[SPEAKER_03]: friends or met before.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of positives to the
different eras of the cups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then obviously, but you get rep and
you get money and you get economics
[SPEAKER_03]: involved and then you get all the
shadiness and the backhanded deals and
[SPEAKER_03]: like the how can I walk in money for me?
[SPEAKER_03]: And those kind of things go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you hear us talking about all of
the ways that we fall short, on a
[SPEAKER_03]: perfectly ideal cup, it doesn't mean that,
uh, there's not value to going and seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: folks and, and doing all that type of
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it just changes, uh, you know,
people's reasons for going change.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and over the years, they've the,
the whole existence and reason for them
[SPEAKER_05]: existing have changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I think some, because they've
happened for long enough now, some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: excitement of just being able to go and
meet a bunch of people and put faces to
[SPEAKER_03]: names.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that might just be an internet
handle or might just be a someone you knew
[SPEAKER_03]: from IG or whatever, but then you get to
spend a few hours with them and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and break bread or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, cause you met at the cup and get baked
and exchange some cool shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that was a neat aspect for awhile.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's become more common now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not as exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but in the beginning, um, it was,
it felt pretty special for a good long
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and you got to meet some of the most
amazing people that you could meet in the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry at one point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for all those reasons, I have mostly
positive memories of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say something funny though,
and this isn't going to knock anybody,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I remember going to the cup and I
thought to myself, especially when it was
[SPEAKER_03]: in Santa Rosa, I'm like, we are the worst
dress group of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is this dude and he looks like he
went to go transplant, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in his car hearts in his rip shirt that
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then sweated and then rolled down the
dirt hill and then drove to the cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in his hand, he's got like a $15,000
dab rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a really nice fanny pack, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you think, Oh, that person looks
homeless except for they're carrying
[SPEAKER_03]: around this like foot tall piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like worth a small car.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're more than my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there was just, there was just
people that like, you know, what you,
[SPEAKER_03]: what you put your money, there was like
well-dressed snazzy people there with nice
[SPEAKER_03]: watches and this and that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were straight hill hippies with zero
ink.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I don't even have clean clothes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have all this cool weed shit,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it brought together very disparate
groups of weed people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And watch out for that dude walking around
pretending to be deaf and dumb too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch out for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a tricky old man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jock, jock, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect skirt from up north.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, anything else, dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, just that we're, we're going
to move to the afternoon on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Matt said, we hope it's a better time
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, you know, it might be easier
to give us that than your Friday night,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, especially for people on the East
coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, I don't know what that is,
but, uh, and you know, everyone's at the
[SPEAKER_03]: Emerald cup this weekend probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: So enjoy yourselves, uh, and, uh,
have a good week everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm tripping.
