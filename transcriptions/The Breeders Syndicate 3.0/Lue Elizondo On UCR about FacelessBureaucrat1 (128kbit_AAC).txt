[SPEAKER_01]: to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, I got a ton of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One question around, you know,
kind of antagonistic behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of rumors that you had a
secret Twitter account and you would kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of semi-publicly post under a different
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you confirm or deny?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever, you know, posted or
interacted with UFO Twitter from an
[SPEAKER_00]: account other than the official?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an intel guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I collect intel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a yes or no, but but,
you know, there's a lot of things that
[SPEAKER_02]: people do to confirm and deny information
and to see if something's real and legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I'm not saying that I did or
maybe friends of mine had or family
[SPEAKER_02]: members had, but, you know, collecting
intel is what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always been what I've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, people are, I'm not
going to confirm or deny if I've had
[SPEAKER_02]: another account on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, first of all, I don't like social
media.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do look at social media from my Twitter
account, which is the only thing I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have Instagram or anything else
simply because people are willing to take
[SPEAKER_02]: the time to write something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they at least have eyes on it,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, someone's going to take the time and
say, hey, Lou, I really like what you did
[SPEAKER_02]: or hey, Lou, that really sucks what you
did.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, honestly, there's a couple of
times where people have called me out,
[SPEAKER_02]: thankfully, because I may have made a
mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: As everybody knows right on my Twitter
page, one of my tenets is I will always
[SPEAKER_02]: hold myself accountable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's been, I think, two or three
instances where I've said something and it
[SPEAKER_02]: either wasn't taken properly or maybe I
miscommunicated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And within 24 hours of it being brought to
my attention, I readdressed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, oh, hey, me and Copa guys,
you know, great catch, great call.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this was my intent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apologies if it was lost in translation or
if I made mistakes or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't my intention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think, you know, that's one of the
ways to hold yourself accountable is
[SPEAKER_02]: through listening to people, even with
dissenting views.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, not the hecklers out there,
people that are just trying to cause drama
[SPEAKER_02]: and trauma.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't look at those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people who have honest questions or
comments or concerns, I look at those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other follow-up questions,
rather, before we get to our game?
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you got a question, Michael?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I do have one, but before we go to
the game and then we can hit that one
[SPEAKER_00]: after, totally up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, your mic's still a little funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what happens when you don't do
shows in 10 months, Michael.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, get it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Lou, it comes in and out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not sure what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, let me go a little further on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get a little bit more direct answer
to rather here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, there's things that I do because I
have that blue little check mark on my
[SPEAKER_02]: name.
[SPEAKER_02]: That actually hinders me from doing a lot
of things that I may want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I want to get on Twitter and ask
somebody about purple curtains,
[SPEAKER_02]: if I do that, it gets really tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's common for a lot of people to use
anonymity in order to research things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll ask you the question, rather.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people say, well, why would you want
to be anonymous?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's face it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I doubt that your real name is rather be
squitting, yet you use it because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: helpful and effective because you're not
quite comfortable providing out your
[SPEAKER_02]: personal information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it and I respect that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the same holds true for other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same feelings and concerns and fears
you may have is precisely the same
[SPEAKER_02]: concerns and fears that other people have
and probably including myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great I mean, I feel like it's a
soft yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's a great answer,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, what do you what were you gonna
say rather?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not a crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not a crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is kind of a weird dynamic going
on in UFO Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, there was an
account that was almost an open secret
[SPEAKER_00]: that was yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure if this one actually was
yours or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of people on,
you know, your supporters who would kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of clamor and onto what that would say and
kind of, you know, rallying cry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it it seemed to kind of stoke fires of
division rather than, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uniting people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, frankly, I found that a
little disappointing if that account
[SPEAKER_00]: really was yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I do understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You haven't asked me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me ask you this bureaucrat one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see that on there right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was that that account was
deleted, I think, in November and someone
[SPEAKER_00]: took it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so that account that's posting right
now definitely isn't you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so so let me ask you another question.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I may rather, if I if I called your
mother a hooker, how would you not be
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome about saying that I'm asking you
hypothetically, if I were to call your
[SPEAKER_02]: mother a prostitute, or your partner or
your kid, how would you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not, by the way, for the record,
I'm not saying that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm asking you a hypothetical that you
now being out, OK, let's say rather be
[SPEAKER_02]: splitting was your real name and everybody
who you were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people were calling your family,
people disparaging things like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: knowing that it wasn't true and knowing
that you couldn't come out and defend
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself publicly because it would never
stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: The moment you feed the seagulls,
more and more seagulls come, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The more you feed the trolls, more and
more trolls come.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so as hypothetical, how would you deal
with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: A, to set the record straight with facts
and data.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, at the same time, trying to to to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Continue to fill it in the type of
behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are people do do make disparaging
comments on me all the time on Twitter and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, and I personally, I think the best
strategy is just to ignore it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I called you a traitor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, understood, but if I if I were to
accuse you of a crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't address it, I call you,
I say, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I caught you yesterday breaking and
entering into a neighbor's house,
[SPEAKER_02]: stealing everything that they have and
killing their dog and leaving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, I've got proof and
evidence to show it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would depend on who's saying that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's someone of your statue of statue,
I probably would feel like I had to
[SPEAKER_00]: respond, but if it's just some person,
anonymous person on the Internet,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not respond.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I disagree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think an anonymous someone on the
Internet is has just as much voice as I do
[SPEAKER_02]: with a blue check or anybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where you and I disagree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everybody, every person in your
audience right now that's listening has
[SPEAKER_02]: just as much of an opinion and entitled to
their opinion as you do and as I do and as
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I disagree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because you and I have a microphone
in front of us doesn't make either one of
[SPEAKER_02]: us higher statue or more important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes us more of a target for sure and
more susceptible to the hatred,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it doesn't make the sting or the pain
any less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm a bit old fashioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I come from a long family of
revolutionaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: My father was in the Bay of Pigs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I chose a career that tends to be a little
bit, I guess, somewhat similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to me, people are the most important
aspect of any conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The entire topic of UFOs and UAPs doesn't
mean anything if you don't have the
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation about people themselves and
what it means because ultimately it's how
[SPEAKER_02]: we deal with information as a species,
which is going to dictate how we deal with
[SPEAKER_02]: the topic of UFOs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, I think everybody should be
part of that conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody is entitled to an opinion and
everybody's opinion should be taken
[SPEAKER_02]: equally until at which point it's proven
that they're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have equal voice because
they're not interested in the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just interested in agitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, let me say this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not attacking you at all, rather.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing devil's advocate here because
you asked me a very direct question and I
[SPEAKER_02]: think you deserve a very direct response,
but also one that helps me explain my
[SPEAKER_02]: position on the topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everybody is entitled to defend
themselves and I think it's terrible and
[SPEAKER_02]: repulsive when people can say things and
you're expected not to defend yourself,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially your credibility when you
defended and fought for your country and
[SPEAKER_02]: friends of yours died for that privilege.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take that very seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: When people accuse my wife or my kids of
something, yes, I take that very
[SPEAKER_02]: seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of the problem I think with
society today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have honor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've lost that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere we've lost the fact that
defending your loved ones and defending
[SPEAKER_02]: your friends and your family is something
we should be doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody who takes those attacks,
there should be consequences unless you
[SPEAKER_02]: have damn proof and evidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why we are in the situation we are
in as a society because no one is held
[SPEAKER_02]: accountable.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's held accountable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally think it's disgusting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is why we're in the situation
we are right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'm not blaming you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not attacking you here, rather.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just giving you my honest feeling and
my opinion from my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd just like to add all the attacks that
are on Twitter, anyone who's paying
[SPEAKER_00]: attention at all can see right through
that and that's obvious BS, all that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I commend you and I can see how that would
be not make you feel great and you'd want
[SPEAKER_00]: to respond, but yeah, it is BS in my
opinion as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, we're humans.
