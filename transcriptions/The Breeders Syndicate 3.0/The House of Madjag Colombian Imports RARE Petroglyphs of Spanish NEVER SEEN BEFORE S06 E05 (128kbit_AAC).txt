[SPEAKER_04]: Breeders Syndicate Update.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only is our merch store up at
syndicategear.com, but all episodes will
[SPEAKER_04]: remain free.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we need from you is interaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're watching the show for your first
time, kick back and enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like the show, feel free to like
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's your second viewing,
we ask a gentle person's agreement that
[SPEAKER_04]: you click the subscribe button.
[SPEAKER_04]: It costs you nothing, but it helps us
tremendously with the sneaky YouTube
[SPEAKER_04]: algorithm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Leaving comments, telling not so his voice
lulls you into a trance works as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope you take the time to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We try to put out the best possible shows
for you we can and want to build this
[SPEAKER_04]: community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again from all of us at the
Breeders Syndicate family.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was like it was like I was
connected with everything around me.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of a sudden, I just started
questioning everything I'd ever been told.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, by the time I got high that very
first time when it started to hit me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, wow,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love that music.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first, we're going to talk about
something that's been going on in the
[SPEAKER_04]: market you've been paying close attention
to, which is what's going to happen up to
[SPEAKER_04]: and post legalization as it pertains to
other countries importing cannabis to the
[SPEAKER_04]: United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we wanted to talk about some of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a few years ago, I started seeing a
lot of big breeders start moving to
[SPEAKER_04]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when I first noticed it was about
two or three years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was almost a mass exodus of some of
the breeders going down to Colombia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people are trying to import
American strains down to Colombia.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Breeder Steve was one of them down
there, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Charlie Garcia, those guys went down down
to Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, must have told me about Charlie.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, Charlie wrote me, too,
because he was so sad with all the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that had happened at ACE that he decided
to just go somewhere new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being Spanish, he would fit down there
so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet he's digging it in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bet they're digging him,
probably treating him like a dignitary,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like royalty.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would assume he's been around forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's done a lot, you know, and that would
be a huge fit down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he knows a lot of people so that when
it comes time to market, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he knows how to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really understand the Colombia
market as much, but is Colombia as
[SPEAKER_04]: controlled by cartels as, say,
Mexico is currently?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the government has stepped in by
legalizing, and they monitor everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's money being passed around
to see who gets what licenses,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that one article said that there's
only, there was how many?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that there's only like 16 or six
that were allowed to produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a lot of licenses for
growers, 60 or 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only 10% roughly were allowed to
produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll be producing their own down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with someone like Charlie or Breed or
Steve, they'll get the right genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: design, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that Charlie's searching in
the back jungles and corners to find as
[SPEAKER_00]: close to land races as he can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, he'd be one of those ideal people
for Colombia, I think, because he
[SPEAKER_04]: understands different types of not just
strains, but types of strains,
[SPEAKER_04]: how they grow in certain provinces and
certain certain elevations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think he'd be excellent for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like finding a strain, and he understands
breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: He understands working a line,
acclimating it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, he's a great person to be down
there doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of shocked that there's so few
people allowed to produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that the US market has a cap
on the number of seed producers licenses
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's kind of late if there is
going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's tens of thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could they be so brilliant that they're
realizing that the future for their seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: would be if there are certain lines like
Chiba or Santa Marta Gold, and they can
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate and make sure that the six
breeders of seeds really have that so that
[SPEAKER_00]: when they sell them, it could be Thailand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thailand's done something similar,
kind of.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I understand it, something similar with
their heritage strains, like the silk
[SPEAKER_04]: squirrel tail, the tiger tail,
snake teeth.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few other kinds from Thailand
they consider like heritage strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, they put a lady in charge of it
named, I don't want to say her name,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lady in charge of all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems that she doesn't even
understand that most of the ties that were
[SPEAKER_04]: sold during that era were Laotians.
[SPEAKER_04]: So she's putting out like this big thing
where like almost reparations that
[SPEAKER_04]: American farmers owe Thai people money for
growing Thai strains and using them over
[SPEAKER_04]: the years when, in fact, they're probably
Laotian strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: So her bringing this forward will kind of
probably point out that most Thai strains
[SPEAKER_04]: are Laotians and that probably the Thais
owe reparations to Laotians if she keeps
[SPEAKER_04]: pushing it that direction, because she
just doesn't understand the culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: She doesn't understand the history of the
strains, but she's in charge of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's disappointing because I
feel like that happens a lot in corporate
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada and America, obviously in Thailand,
is that you have corporate money coming in
[SPEAKER_04]: and corporate money choosing who is to
head the, who spearhead these campaigns.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of the time, the people with the
money and incorporations do not have
[SPEAKER_04]: access to the people who have the
knowledge or have been keeping this
[SPEAKER_04]: clandestine stuff, you know, keeping track
of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The archivists, they just don't have
access to these people or even know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they wait to be approached by these
people who tell them, I am that person.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it almost, I almost feel like they do,
they have no way to check, do checks and
[SPEAKER_04]: balances on if this person's full of it or
not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's almost like, to me, it feels
random on who they choose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you're going to be the lady,
you know, like you're going to be the guy
[SPEAKER_04]: to represent it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know a lot of Thai people or people
in Thailand right now that are super
[SPEAKER_04]: interested in land races and preservation
are a little upset about that because,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, now she's representing certain
strains as their heritage strains that may
[SPEAKER_04]: not even be, they could be, you know,
Dutch hybrids of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they will always be pushed as their
heritage strain now, because she said so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_04]: The politics that go behind all this
stuff, because you never really realize
[SPEAKER_04]: how much it's going to affect potential
future written down history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found the article from April 12th of
2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking two years ago,
and it says there's 126 companies in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's two years ago, but only 16 for
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 126 have been cleared to grow and have
huge, but only 16 of those 126 were
[SPEAKER_00]: qualified to produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says these companies are allowed to
register genetics in batches of 10 at a
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the phytosanitary test will mandate
them to cultivate a test batch,
[SPEAKER_00]: engages properties before it can go to the
market or register the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several well-known Colombian land race
strains will be featured.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are going to try to do that,
that heritage strain type thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Santa Marta Gold, Chiba, Black,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully they choose someone like Charlie
to spearhead that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone that actually knows their business
or got a mustafunk or someone cool,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know he's not there, but it would be
nice to consult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure they'll need testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do we know about the political
climate in Colombia?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we talked a little bit about cartels in
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you think this interplays with
moving the product from Colombia through
[SPEAKER_04]: Mexico?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's going to have to pass through
Mexico to get to the US unless it's done
[SPEAKER_04]: on airplanes, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I don't know why I would assume
that they can't do it on airplanes if it's
[SPEAKER_04]: legal, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still in like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Outlaw mindset.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to smuggle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 747 packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the way UPS will pack certain carrier
planes, they own them and use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that size, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll be perfectly protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll keep them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows how they'll seal them?
[SPEAKER_00]: They may even back seal them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they'll glass bottle them
like some of the boutique companies in
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern California, but they'll
definitely, they've learned their lessons
[SPEAKER_00]: over decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they may have some that they ferment
on purpose and help bring about changes in
[SPEAKER_00]: the smoke qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know when it will be, but once
we're federally legal, I bet they'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: their lobbyists already waiting and
already have their plans made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may even right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it happens, they'll rush in and
there'll be all these companies in America
[SPEAKER_00]: fighting, saying we need to have tariffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to have tariffs and stop them
coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington DC battle.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it almost, I mean, it kind of
would be common sense that a lot of these
[SPEAKER_04]: companies, because we know a few years ago
that a lot of people moved down there and
[SPEAKER_04]: started doing this, that they are in these
what were once cartels, maybe,
[SPEAKER_04]: or maybe what is backed by clandestine
money in Colombia and Mexico.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have way more money than a lot of the
corporations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is what I've been trying to tell
people, like a lot of the people that are
[SPEAKER_04]: in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: right now, a lot of the major companies,
let's, for example, Shmungle Shmoys,
[SPEAKER_04]: something like that level of bigness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they may not have enough money at all
to be able to compete with the
[SPEAKER_04]: international market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's just a fact.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're not talking, you know,
the hundreds of millions of millions of
[SPEAKER_04]: dollars that we have in America to invest
in some of these cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're talking like billions and
trillions of dollars being invested.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of these people, these companies
that were started by actual growers,
[SPEAKER_04]: in some cases getting investments from,
you know, doctors, lawyers, chiropractors,
[SPEAKER_04]: that money is not going to hold any weight
when these guys come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to get crushed because
there's no way, just by simple economics,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the way it works is, you know,
if someone has X amount of space and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 times the space that you have and they
can sell it for pennies on the dollar
[SPEAKER_04]: compared to what you can afford to sell it
at, and they can afford to take a loss for
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 years, there's no way to compete.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just how all capitalist markets
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a new market where, I guess you could
say this is not a new commodity,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's going to be considered a
commodity in a broader sense for the
[SPEAKER_04]: world, sort of, that people can invest in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a commodity like pork
bellies or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when those come into play,
it dumps out any mom and pop chance of
[SPEAKER_04]: being able to ever compete again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was in charge of a big cannabis
operation in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd definitely have my representatives in
Colombia, Thailand, and tropical areas
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, which I wouldn't doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Spain has such a large presence down
there from the people like Charlie that
[SPEAKER_00]: are the growers, then they have friends
who own stores and companies in their
[SPEAKER_00]: countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of millionaires and there's
quite a few billionaires these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes more sense in South America,
I guess, or Mexico, or maybe even
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand, for the cartels that are doing
other things illegally, cane and opium,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they make billions of dollars and
now they can put it into something legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like washing their money.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like laundering their money to
retirement.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how do you think Mexico is going to
interplay in this whole transition?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Mexico is a bit behind Colombia as
far as how people are set up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The politics are going to be much
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how much different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the level of political
corruption in Colombia, but I'd imagine
[SPEAKER_04]: it's somewhere in between Mexico and the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: as far as corruption in politics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wonder with the powers and the
money that the cartels have in Mexico,
[SPEAKER_04]: how they will be prepared to enter the
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because with all that land in Mexico and
as cheap as land is in Mexico,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it seems like that and the climate
are the determinant factors on where a
[SPEAKER_04]: person can grow cannabis, essentially,
on where these farms will start popping up
[SPEAKER_04]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gustavo Petro is a former guerrilla
fighter and he is now the president in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes a big difference because he
has a much different view, much more down
[SPEAKER_00]: to earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not like the high end, only money
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an economist, politician,
but he was a former guerrilla fighter and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's been in president since 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Mexico has too much corruption and
murder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia used to be the kidnap capital of
the world, but Mexico is far and above it
[SPEAKER_00]: now because, I don't know, it's just so
split into so many factions.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you had only four big godfathers and
godmothers in Colombia or five,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was very organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mexico, if you look at all the
cartels, the maps that show like 25
[SPEAKER_00]: different ones and they're trying to
combine and then others are fighting the
[SPEAKER_00]: others, I think Mexico will lag far
behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's so close to the United
States, that will have a spillover
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial effect for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like think automobiles, everything
was Ford and Chevy and then suddenly
[SPEAKER_00]: Toyota and all these other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, German, okay, Volkswagen was
always here too and BMW, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But suddenly, when imports started
floating, to the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: they came in with some great quality and
stole away a lot of the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they've been playing catch up for
years, Ford and Chevy.
[SPEAKER_00]: With electrifying, it's going to be
interesting because Tesla kind of broke
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground, but now there's companies in
China that make electric cars that are
[SPEAKER_00]: $7,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's gonna be hard to compete with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if we tariff it 100%, it could 14,000
for an electric car just to use in your
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And around shopping and stuff,
those will sell like crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Affordable, affordable electric.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that'd be insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know what's funny is,
I collect a lot of different things as
[SPEAKER_04]: I've talked about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And over the years, I've watched the
guitar market specifically and the
[SPEAKER_04]: knockoffs that have come and how fast the
turnaround time is on guitar knockoffs now
[SPEAKER_04]: is literally, it went from probably five
or six years from a model being released
[SPEAKER_04]: to where you were able to buy that model
bootleg in China pretty easily for 300 to
[SPEAKER_04]: $400 as opposed to 10,000 or 15,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: That much?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that much of a difference because
they're doing custom shop, like artist
[SPEAKER_04]: edition versions, like perfect replicas
that you can get and sell them for 500
[SPEAKER_04]: bucks because they're doing it in mass,
but they're doing it so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they're down to about two months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two months after each line is released for
Guitar Maker, if it's a high selling line,
[SPEAKER_04]: they will have it knocked off in two
months now as opposed to six years.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no turnaround time whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I imagine it's like that with a lot of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: China's able to reproduce and produce on
such a level and on such an affordable
[SPEAKER_04]: level that we couldn't even begin to
understand over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six cents a gram production price they're
predicting in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to see a replay in the
weed market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico could certainly compete in their
more tropical areas like Oaxaca and
[SPEAKER_00]: Guerrero because people live in the
mountains and they grow their own beans
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a much simpler life like much of
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia has some big cities though and a
port on the Caribbean and a port on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Atlantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can ship right from the Atlantic
side, right up to LA or San Diego,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they can ship right to Miami from,
you know, Buena Ventura.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is the one that's by Santa
Marta and it, you know, pick up a little
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaican along the way, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you ever see a country like China
entering the cannabis market based on
[SPEAKER_04]: culture and religious aspects?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand and look at all of Southeast
Asia, you know, Kalimantan and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the guys on the forums from
Australia, certain people, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Wally Duck and Rocket Bong and a few bunch
of others, they've gotten strains from
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulawesi, Kalimantan, and these are land
races that aren't polluted yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't any Dutch citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hippies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more difficult for the society to
just go over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Rob Clark's been there and so has
Shanti Baba because they're both big
[SPEAKER_00]: fishermen and they love to fish from the
shore type and Rob holds some records in
[SPEAKER_00]: New Zealand, the annual things there that
they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has world records.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have his permission to pop them up
if he'd let me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me of him barely holding a 50
kilogram fish in his arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like Papa Hemingway.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got white hair now and white.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in his rubber clothes because he's on
the beach, you know, pulling these in and
[SPEAKER_00]: he loves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently Shanti Baba and he were
thinking of maybe even getting a little
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny resort in former Borneo, Kalimantan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A wild Borneo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over to some place where the people
running it were longtime friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, longtime friends and seed nerds
like strain nerds that you'd sit there and
[SPEAKER_04]: nerd.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, that'd be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if it ever made a time that
Americans can go to Colombia and not get
[SPEAKER_00]: kidnapped or bothered because from,
you know, someone from Spain speaking
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect Castilian Spanish, you know,
they're going to fit right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, Americans are still viewed,
I believe, in many of the countries like
[SPEAKER_00]: south of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's going to someone's going to be
willing to pay for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe it's only 10 grand and not 10
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you were really special.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's only 400, you know,
but that's that's months of someone's
[SPEAKER_04]: livelihood there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's enough for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could get a special endorsement says,
do not kidnap.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was watching something the
other day on it was a guy that went to
[SPEAKER_04]: Pakistan and he was going there to go up
through the Kunduz Valley.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, he was going from like the
Khyber Pass over the Kunduz Valley and up
[SPEAKER_04]: through Pakistan, up through Nepal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone that he met along the way
were just the most kind, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: sweet people, the cultures.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're absolutely insanely sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like most of them, he'd be saying,
like, have you ever seen Taliban out here?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, I've never seen a Taliban.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have Taliban.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe down in Peshawar, you know,
like in the big city.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're like, they've never been up
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like so they they they one thing that they
were impressing in this video the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: time, the Pakistan people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Were impressing like Americans are very
welcome here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We love Americans.
[SPEAKER_04]: We love people from other cultures.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of these places he was going
were Greek Greek descendants from when
[SPEAKER_04]: Alexander the Great passed through that
pastoral area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a lot of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the Hunza Valley.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the Hunza people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where this guy was staying with
a lot was with the Hunza people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just seem so nice and friendly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wonderful, wonderful culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a little booklet I got in the
health food store in the early 70s on the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole Hunza story and their diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eat a lot of apricots, which has a
lot of benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're they don't eat a lot of meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do, it's probably goat meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They eat lots of yak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Hunza Valley until maybe 10 years ago
was very difficult to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to trek for days to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know there is a road that leads in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the people are probably still
just as friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They called it like the Garden of Eden,
like it was a paradise hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these people lived in perfect harmony.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have different districts,
different little regional voting areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not even voting like people in
charge that were voted in.
[SPEAKER_00]: By their tribe because they were such good
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was good, good, good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the dude who went there,
it was mostly because of the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: Shangri-La story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he was trying to figure out like
where this was kind of considered or where
[SPEAKER_04]: it was just going in that area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, if I remember correctly,
it was either the Hunza people or
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere close to there where they were
saying they are not Muslim.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are looked at as second hand
citizens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really quite.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not given proper representation in
parliament in Pakistan and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_04]: because they're not a Muslim culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I thought that was absolutely
fascinating that this little tiny bastion
[SPEAKER_04]: of like free people exist in their own
little area in Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're just so sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: They seem sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I never been there, but they
seem sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was thinking about the Kogi people,
who were all white and they live in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Santa Marta mountains, there's a beautiful
movie that came out maybe 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's called Message to Little Brother,
I think was the name of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I researched this the other day again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's about an hour and a half long
documentary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't go into the Kogi highest
villages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had them blocked on these paths up
into the Andes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they won't let you beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have the right to because it's
their land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they consider everyone else in the
world like us, little brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was an environmental movie
showing how they have noticed the snow is
[SPEAKER_00]: no longer on top of Santa Marta.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather is changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because of little brother not
knowing what he's doing and toying with
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right next door is Venezuela.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's parts of Venezuela and then
going to Guyana that are almost
[SPEAKER_00]: unexplored.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right below that's the upper end
of the Amazon, which is also very little
[SPEAKER_00]: unexplored.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortunately, there's people helping
the tribes there maintain their lands and
[SPEAKER_00]: hold back the people who chop down the
rainforest to make the palm oil
[SPEAKER_00]: plantations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We live in interesting times, that's for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing Santa Marta Gold
coming in original.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Oaxacan, some strength of Oaxacan that
no one knew existed because the people
[SPEAKER_00]: there were guarding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became legal and they were no longer
criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had friends who were in the city who
knew how to bring it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it'll happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think that there's a good shot
that we have these Colombian Golds and
[SPEAKER_04]: Oaxacans even in the US seed collections,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even with Rob Clark and others like that,
Watson, I'm sure they have these old
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Watson said a million times that he has
everything that he's ever touched,
[SPEAKER_04]: stored, frozen forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope that they do bring these back
out and grow them at point of origin type
[SPEAKER_04]: places, grow them, take it back to
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow it at point of origin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring some of this natural stuff back that
has been wiped out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one 1977 Guerrero seed that a
friend found in his desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And down the road with the advances in PCR
and DNA and RNA, it's very possible that
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be able to deconstruct it just by
breaking the seed and taking the remnants
[SPEAKER_00]: of whatever's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetic code, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Re-engineer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's GMO.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very, very, very possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't imply that it's easy,
but it's definitely very possible to take
[SPEAKER_04]: something that has its genetic code and if
they understand the genetic code and how
[SPEAKER_04]: to reinsert it, it'll take years to
understand the DNA map of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: those ways of where and why, but at some
point they should be able to have a,
[SPEAKER_04]: what would you call that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a blank canvas type seed that they
can inject this code into.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely think that's in our very near
future and something like that will be
[SPEAKER_04]: absolutely so important to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tissue culture is at a cutting edge right
now and the company that's really the most
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced is in Canada and they recently
opened in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I contacted them maybe a year,
two years ago, called them in Canada and
[SPEAKER_00]: they said at this point having a single
seed like that, it isn't feasible,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's on its way and they feel very
confident that they will be able to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed like you said and somehow take what's
left in it and inject it into tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture and then grow it again and then
cross it and make new seeds of the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's not too far out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think so at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kerry Mullis is the cool guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a surfer too who invented PCR
basically and he died just a few years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote a really cool book that I have
and he did a lot of acid when he was in
[SPEAKER_00]: college and he more or less saw the RNA
helix or whatever on acid and that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed him to then make the final steps
and make PCR real.
[SPEAKER_00]: He worked for a company at the time so
they got the patent for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got the Nobel Prize of chemistry that
year by the way and his friend said you
[SPEAKER_00]: should just quit your job and then do it
on the outside and he estimated it would
[SPEAKER_00]: be worth this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 20 years ago when he wrote this
book I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said it would have been worth about a
quarter billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, it'd be worth probably 20 billion
dollars because PCR is used in everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you work for a company, they own you
and they own your soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these books are non-fiction,
almost every single one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have probably 40, 50 fiction books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with the internet, I can skip most of
these books.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they're still my friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't let go of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every move that I do is insane,
mostly because of my book collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's heavy.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many boxes of books and I know
a lot of these are online, but at the same
[SPEAKER_04]: time, there's a lot that aren't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the ones I've been trying to
scan in and get out there for people
[SPEAKER_04]: because I really have this fervent belief
that in order for us all to progress and
[SPEAKER_04]: get at the level to where I wish people
were when it comes to breeding and
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis breeding and taking it seriously,
we all have to have access to the same
[SPEAKER_04]: information and be on the same playing
field to have expectations of people to
[SPEAKER_04]: put in the work and to know what's what.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm not making that available and I
have the resources to, then I'm part of
[SPEAKER_04]: the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's weird, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm determined to get it all scanned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had 10 feet of National Geographic at
one point because my grandfather gave me a
[SPEAKER_00]: subscription when I was nine years old and
for the next 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when he died, a friend of mine picked
up where he left off and kept sending them
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once it went digital and I realized
you can search every copy for what I need
[SPEAKER_00]: in my life, I gave mine to the boys and
girls clubs and it was 600 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so happy to give them away because
they would use them to cut out photos and
[SPEAKER_00]: watches or do whatever they're doing in
their class and that was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now in high times, that's a different
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give those to the boys and girls club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely going to hold on to those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you need to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Share them with people like you and other
friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since high times has put the whole archive
online, I have several, but I still find
[SPEAKER_04]: myself picking them up every time that I
see them for whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, man, I know I can just go access
it online, but there's something about
[SPEAKER_04]: having a hard copy from the 70s,
being able to smell it and flip the pages.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something about that that I'll
never be able to walk away from,
[SPEAKER_04]: smell of books, the feel of books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I underline, I'm not keeping a book
so that it'll be valuable later unless
[SPEAKER_00]: it's one of the ones I collected as first
editions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I index my books and I open the front
page and it's got my index and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: just a small one where I wrote that many
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like page 91 is about shin splints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Page 92 is about ligaments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beauty of books.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never really taken notes on books,
period.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always memorized what I could.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was doing a lot of UFO research,
I ran into a guy that just blew my mind
[SPEAKER_04]: because every single book, he had a long
list of everything he had ever read about
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd be like, have you read this book?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, here's my notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be able to read it real fast and I was
like, this is so useful.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I would have done this for every book
that I've ever read, I could be helping a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of people real fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm making a habit to do stuff like
that, to make notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably the best book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called The Rocks Begin to Speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's by Levan Martino.
[SPEAKER_00]: About petroglyphs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but this guy, he was raised on,
what's his background?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's part Native American and he was
raised,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is how I index my books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the pages that have, things,
word order, clarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of archeologists thinks he's full of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's no longer alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, he was the first to start,
like he said, rocks broke the silence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used his techniques personally in
even a magic cannon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of petroglyphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one that's very simple that's just
a circle with a dot in the middle of it
[SPEAKER_00]: and it means something there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see this on the rock and he said he
walked around the boulder and on the
[SPEAKER_00]: backside there was a spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had anyone in, it didn't matter what
language he spoke, they all spoke sign
[SPEAKER_00]: language or rock writing language and it's
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to other countries like Central
America, South America, Asia, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: petroglyphs or hieroglyphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the glyphs in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just wonderful to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's amazing stuff like that to
even be found in the United States because
[SPEAKER_04]: the United States, when we think about our
history, we think of it traditionally
[SPEAKER_04]: being 600, 500 years old from the European
conquest.
[SPEAKER_04]: But realistically, like you said,
magic, there is a beautiful, I've never
[SPEAKER_04]: seen petroglyphs.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can imagine the energy, the
vibrations around stuff like that has got
[SPEAKER_04]: to be magical.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorites that I've found,
I think I sent you a link to the NFTs I
[SPEAKER_00]: made because I was searching, when NFTs
first came out a few years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a big deal and I searched open sea
and wearable and all these sites and no
[SPEAKER_00]: one had done anything with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found one, finally one photo of a
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some guy had posted on open sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I took all kinds of stuff and wove
them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite, most rare petroglyphs
I've ever found with my first grow partner
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug, or second actually, showed men on
horseback.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was early congistadors because they
have helmets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fairly rare thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few in Northern Arizona and
Utah as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is not in Madjag Canyon proper,
but five miles away on top of a mesa drops
[SPEAKER_00]: off into another canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend and I were hiking over to look
over the edge and see these other canyons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were considering other grow spots and
we found this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty stunning to see a horse shape
and a guy on it and he's got a helmet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dates back to the first congistadors.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's got to be them documenting seeing
these guys come through or trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: figure out what they were seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 1500s and 1600s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conquistadors went through Arizona all the
way up to the Hobie Reservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came also from Santa Fe, which was
their capital at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mogollon was one of the first Spanish
governors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mogollon rim is named after Juan
Ignacio Flores Mogollon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was for four years in 1610 or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the governor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see they're on horses clearly and
they're humanoid forms and they all have
[SPEAKER_00]: headdresses on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The horse was introduced as you know by
conquistadors to North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were stolen many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they were traded that often
because they were too valuable in the
[SPEAKER_00]: early days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Native Americans got some and then the
Plains Indians, there was hundreds,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was tens of thousands of wild horses
at one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like there were millions in Buffalo
and they were the main ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to go over rough terrain in the West,
the conquistadors, they don't show up in
[SPEAKER_00]: many petroglyphs, the books.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like a freeze frame of one of
them talking, looking back and talking to
[SPEAKER_04]: one of his other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Giving them orders, his hands up
directing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three clear ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marching officer and then below that at
the back left, it looks like another human
[SPEAKER_00]: feature, like he's on a horse perhaps too
or he's falling off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then below, it's difficult to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the larger version that shows this
whole boulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: This section you're looking at here is
about two feet wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, three feet wide and two feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But each of those horses petroglyphs are
about I'd say eight inches tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we saw that, we were like,
oh my gosh, because they're not common.
[SPEAKER_04]: Has this been documented in any petroglyph
books, this picture that you've taken?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been wanting to go get with my
friends at Coconino National Forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known them for 40 years, the
archeologists there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a new head archeologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter Pillis was the previous archeologist
and he loved petroglyphs too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two huge sites outside of Sedona,
Honaki and Palatki.
[SPEAKER_00]: Palatki's open to the public, Honaki's
were open to tourists and they walk you
[SPEAKER_00]: through and they describe stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter came down once and gave a three-hour
class that I was fortunate enough to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: part of with three other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went over what they were saying about
stuff and then he told them if they were
[SPEAKER_00]: full of shit or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were 90% totally wrong.
I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Shahn's cave.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, well, actually in the Sinawa,
which means without water, that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: nickname the ancient people of the Verdi
Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, there was no documented signs of
shamanism at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They called this the Shahn's cave because
of the petroglyphs that were associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he would go through and then say what
was more likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had already been a grower 20 years
before I met Peter and I shared something
[SPEAKER_00]: with him, but I never took my petroglyph
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have all these as photos, which I've
since digitized, as you can tell here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was stunned ever, ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to newspaper, not newspaper
rock, but this big one that's up near the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopi Rez and other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the largest in Northern Arizona is
called Newspaper Rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a site that was used for many
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would add to it and add to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a newspaper they akin it to
because it had so much information that
[SPEAKER_00]: was obviously packed into the rock over
many decades, not just one person sat down
[SPEAKER_00]: for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ancient graffiti?
[SPEAKER_00]: This takes to do one of these figures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This patina is called desert varnish and
it appears on rocks as they get older,
[SPEAKER_00]: certain types.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is volcanic rock and it gets this
brown or blackish patina.
[SPEAKER_00]: To peck into it, it reveals the real color
of the lighter rock underneath,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it takes hours and hours to do one of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using another rock in your hand
that's hard, like maybe a piece of granite
[SPEAKER_00]: or something and make a point so that you
can peck the design you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might have represented more than one
person leaving their information over many
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the top three, at least of the
front two here, were probably simultaneous
[SPEAKER_00]: in one stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they spent a week doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think the part that catches me is
the guy in the middle with his hand up
[SPEAKER_04]: like direct like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's like it's almost like
obviously he was the boss.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoever it was they were portraying him as
the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: He may have had a stick in his hand to
whip the horse with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they didn't have wearers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may have been they were portraying
that he had something he was hitting the
[SPEAKER_00]: horse to make it go faster, so I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the title that the Spanish
used either.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be another interesting thing to
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you definitely saw something on his
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, and the guy up front here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, had these been rival tribes in
the Plains Indians, they were lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: headdresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was this late 17s, I think,
or maybe mostly in the 1800s.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are going back to 15s and 1600s when
the first horses came through in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonawa and the Mogollon people saw them
passing through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were just like, what the heck are
those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they didn't even know what horses
were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine being mind blowing to see
a horse?
[SPEAKER_04]: And these humans on top of them,
just riding them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wearing armor and helmets and because they
were worried about getting shot by arrows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: How quickly though, like the Plains
Indians adapted to be able to or Native
[SPEAKER_04]: Americans were adapted to be able to ride
horses and became very proficient
[SPEAKER_04]: horsemen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bareback too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just amazing how they adapted to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it helped them hunt and made their
life easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call them dog soldiers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that rode the early horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were comparing horses to large.
[SPEAKER_04]: What does it feel like to be around these
petroglyphs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get any like, I know it's kind of
hard to quantify spirituality and feelings
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff, but did you ever get any kind
of spark of energy or any kind of,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's kind of sounds so weird saying that,
but did you ever feel anything around
[SPEAKER_04]: these petroglyphs of note?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but it's hard to quantify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, sitting next to a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made underground fire pits so that the
flames wouldn't be visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1600 feet above us was a small Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ruins of it, just two foot walls,
but the outlines created made about 20
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms and down below the boulders that
next near the Creek that had the,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these petroglyphs had outline of
that structure, you know, 16 rooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: little squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had some very interesting
communication and to feel first that next
[SPEAKER_00]: near the Creek that had the, some of these
petroglyphs had outline of that structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 16 rooms, little squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had some very interesting
communication and to feel, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be growing weed in the middle of all
that was very powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had a farm somewhere and just had 10
acres, it'd be cool, but being surrounded
[SPEAKER_00]: by this and at night hearing a Creek
flowing by and bears smashing through the
[SPEAKER_00]: bushes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the only thing that divides you
from the people who wrote those messages
[SPEAKER_04]: is time and like, what a small barrier in
some ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: And understanding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And understanding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to talk to you about one thing
and this is something that I feel like,
[SPEAKER_04]: like I talk about it a lot, but I'm
younger.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even in my generation, it was almost a
lost art unless you were into maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: tattooing or even plumbing or part of a
union job or something like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is apprenticeship, learning a craft
under someone, learning the apprentice
[SPEAKER_04]: mentor role where you snap to it,
do what you say, you know, because you're
[SPEAKER_04]: learning and how that applies in modern
days and how much of that is missing now.
[SPEAKER_04]: In your time, when you wanted to learn to
grow, were there guys that you could
[SPEAKER_04]: apprentice under?
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you have found an apprentice in
the seventies, let's say or sixties to
[SPEAKER_04]: learn to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: In 76, when my dealer friend from Tempe
said, let's grow our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already had a green thumb as far as I
worked on five acres of garlic with some
[SPEAKER_00]: other hippies in Cottonwood, Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love taking care of plants in my
yard, vines, anything that could make it
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I planted a few trees already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I I kind of knew soil culture a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Comfortable to step in then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I didn't know is anything about
the needs of cannabis as it grew and
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when to harvest it and how to
manicure it, how to dry it, manicure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was self taught with my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had never grown either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily we had the grower's guides and
later marijuana botany and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I frequently say the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: The written word has always been my guide
and my mentor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I would buy books and books and books on
everything and just read and get ideas and
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't apprentice as a carpenter or
plumber or anything like that today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with the advent of more
artificial intelligence, doing other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, if you can fix air conditioners or
heaters, or plumbing or electricity or
[SPEAKER_00]: build things, you're not going to have to
worry until it's like George Jetson time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are robots that can walk around
and do everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that that day is going to
come, but probably will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe 50 years from now or 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're they're creating robots to fight
other humans, which is stupid or other
[SPEAKER_00]: robots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Artific, you know, being an apprentice to
a great mentor would be fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people who have gone to work in
Colorado at Big Rose and learn the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a couple of years, they come
home and they they've learned what they
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to know to feel confident to do it
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so we.
[SPEAKER_00]: But jumping out, yeah, like you mentioned,
if you're not invested in it and you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't put 10 or 20 years in,
you you can always just quit, like you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned and walk away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas someone who spent a whole lot of
years learning how to refinish furniture
[SPEAKER_00]: or build furniture or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a nephew who's learning about
furniture right now, and he's refinishing
[SPEAKER_00]: it and starting from scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think he has a teacher other
than.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and that's that's a legitimate
method of learning now that wasn't there
[SPEAKER_04]: when we were, you know, doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to change out my headlights
and my Tacoma because they're 10 years old
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're fading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've bought three cleaners to put on,
you know, and wipe the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's polycarbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes back to being bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I looked online at a guy who shows how
to replace them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like 10 different electric
electrical connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you could take a photo every time
you got to a certain spot, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: pull this one off and this take a photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you pull it out,
take a photo.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to a dealer and paid them to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took them an hour and a half to put two
new ones in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have taken me two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I made a mistake and then have to
troubleshoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which wire did I leave off or put on the
wrong one?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it costs one hundred fifty dollars a
light to have them do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was worth every penny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bet those guys who did that in an
hour and a half, they apprenticed for
[SPEAKER_00]: many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mechanics who can do stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in awe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never made it to that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I changed my course I ever did was
change the starter in my Volkswagen van.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt very proud.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to have a 66 bug and the idle pin
would always mess up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I learned that if I got duct tape and a
pencil eraser and put it on that idle pin,
[SPEAKER_04]: that it would fix it every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about the most auto mechanics I've
ever done is the old eraser.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You turn it on its head and found a
workaround, which I did, which I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: some great mechanics back in the days that
could do the same thing and duct tape,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bailing wire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to have bailing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you you're off road and you hit
that muffler and it's hanging,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can strap it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's also.
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea and this this kind of goes along
with the idea of mentorship,
[SPEAKER_04]: apprenticeship, and it's becoming a part
of a group.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, when you become a part of a
forum, when the forum days were around and
[SPEAKER_04]: big, you know, I remember my first time
coming on the forums and trying to figure
[SPEAKER_04]: out how first, what am I?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do I say without looking stupid?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I integrate into this group that I
don't quite understand some of these
[SPEAKER_04]: subcultures?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was a punk rock kid in my area
growing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really relate to the deadhead
community very much, but that's a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: this community is the hippie community.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've got to learn to integrate and
communicate with people I've never really
[SPEAKER_04]: integrated with or communicated with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or understand their cultural subcultural
level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't really seem to have that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we have are social media where you
just blast out whatever you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But back then you had to integrate
yourself into a group to gain access,
[SPEAKER_04]: not even to gain access, but to to learn
from each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at that point, you know, to share.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then cuts were shared between the group
because you trusted each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: You knew each other, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was over a period of several years
where a lot of these groups and
[SPEAKER_04]: friendships were formed and bound.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I talked to the guys today,
like in my in our Patreon Discord group,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I see how some guys try to assimilate,
you know, and some don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just it's very different than the
forum era where you where you watch these
[SPEAKER_04]: personalities kind of try to assimilate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas now it's just like lots of
clashing personalities all falling on top
[SPEAKER_04]: of each other and nobody really
understanding assimilation into groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean like IC magas?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bunch of personalities all
screaming at each other as opposed to like
[SPEAKER_04]: a group working together.
[SPEAKER_04]: IC mag had the great, you know,
SD's finest group that did pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: The San Diego's finest cuts on IC mag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those guys did really good for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's so far and few between.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you have the land race groups on
IC mag that all kind of pulled together,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have some good groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, they all had a huge following.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom Hill eventually got so fed up with all
these people hounding him and he he would
[SPEAKER_00]: just blast people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom Hill was one of my early heroes of the
forums because he didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that he would just go off on
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was that he would do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was correct when he was saying it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and he was a geneticist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got off with the top of if he and Rob
Clark were sitting down or someone who
[SPEAKER_00]: really knew genetics well, he he would
have no difficulty, you know, talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about back crossing and just all the
different mathematical formulas involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you knew what how many would be this?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many would be that way?
[SPEAKER_00]: What gene expressions would do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beyond me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can kind of grab the concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm growing a hybrid and I have 10 of
those come up and I look at them,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see differences in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure I could scientifically say,
well, one quarter, we're going to be this
[SPEAKER_00]: cross, you know, express these recessive
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, yeah, it's something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to have conversations with him is
is very humbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on a breeder level, you can go going
back to the apprenticeship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine being an apprentice petroglyph
artist in the Native American days or
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who made projectile points,
whether they were spear points for the
[SPEAKER_00]: paleo Indians 10,000 years ago to run up
and kill buffalo or the archaic period
[SPEAKER_00]: that came next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were adult adult points that were
look like large arrowheads and they would
[SPEAKER_00]: boost a spear throwers spear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, the bow and arrow showed
up in the southwest and little tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: points, which are sometimes called bird
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to be very tiny and sharp and
lightweight because they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: shooting through the air on a stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you put a big point on there,
that arrow would just go 40 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those to find and to find their ancient
work on the ground when you're hiking is
[SPEAKER_00]: mind boggling to to know how long it would
take to be an apprentice and get skilled
[SPEAKER_00]: at making those when they had such a tough
life to live every day that they couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: just take a whole day to make points
unless they were special and they were so
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe women, they they believe that
there was great women point makers,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, because they didn't go hunting as
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were taking care of the home
front and they would have possible time,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least before the advent of people
growing crops and corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you had to be out, you know,
taking care of the plants and stopping
[SPEAKER_00]: animals from eating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've covered a lot of territory today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love petroglyph stuff, dude,
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like it was like I was
connected with everything around me.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of a sudden, I just started
questioning everything I'd ever been told.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, by the time I got high,
that very first time when it started to
[SPEAKER_03]: hit me and I'm like, wow,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got high.
