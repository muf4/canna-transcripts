[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_05]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_05]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_03]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_03]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_05]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_05]: clandestine scene, researching everything
from cannabis strain history, old
[SPEAKER_05]: smuggling tales from the first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, neither one of those was the right
intro.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like, fuck it, let's go into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with the legendary Chucky Pollen,
trying to get to the bottom of this beef a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit, see what he's up to,
where he's from, where he's been,
[SPEAKER_03]: what clicks he's rolled with, all that
good shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So welcome, Chucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you finally
[SPEAKER_00]: made it to the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you made it to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, that meat, I just like good meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know me, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to steal the dude's meat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to steal a man's meat.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to go to jail, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck Kroger, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay out the fucking meat section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been, but anyways, I had time to
think locked up and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started rapping and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some other stuff, but I was thinking
like, you know, we go way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always told me like when I,
you hit me up when I first got locked up
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cause you ghosted me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you told me if I, if you told me,
bro, if I ever needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we ever spoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I swear, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hit me up at that time or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe, whatever you hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my thing is you told me like,
bro, if I never ever needed help just to
[SPEAKER_00]: hold my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I get out of being locked up or
whatever, you, you'd help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was I standing in front of the Kelly
connection booth and was my eye a little
[SPEAKER_03]: wonky?
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro, any of that in your memory,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have no bread on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't go to know your boots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause your shit was hella good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember in the bathroom, I caught you in
the bathroom or you get the journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the guy, the guy with the Kim
crosses and she, I was trying to get you
[SPEAKER_00]: to do the cloud with me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you, you kind of like low key diss me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Low key.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even sure if that was you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a man he had on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked like a disguise of some sort.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you were really trying to
be super low key yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been in there, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I said, I had time to clear
my head and jail and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before we get started, I wanted to
show you how much of a big fan I am of
[SPEAKER_00]: like discord and Denali and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the Mazola shirt on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a shirt just like there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you are, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking face, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if y'all can see this shirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a Mazola shirt with my face shirt
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt Mathers right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the with the blonde hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, I know you got some questions for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some questions lined up from the
discourse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the people from the discord got
some questions for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can rock out whenever you're fucking
ready, pal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the first one sent in,
I think the guy's name was Auto Growers
[SPEAKER_03]: Only.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wanted to know when you started puffing
tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Puffing tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean like big shit like traditionals
and shit like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because well, I ain't gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you know, people gonna try to
diss me and a very wise man in this court
[SPEAKER_00]: once said, you know, people always don't
remember where you started.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a closet auto grower for a long
fucking time just because of my growing
[SPEAKER_00]: situation and illegal steak back in my
home state of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I had to get that little perpetual
harvest going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so, you know, as far as puffing tough,
you know, I've been fucking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't even consider myself a grower,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm not gonna sit here and lie and
say I've been the grower for 20 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: shit like that, because like I really
didn't start growing until I started
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking with the autos and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like as far as my like how I got
involved with the game or whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to call it, it goes pretty far back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a long story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want me to get into
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ram a little way, please.
Please.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like long stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I wouldn't even consider
myself a real grower until like the last
[SPEAKER_00]: probably like, I don't know, like 10 years
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in my early 20s, though,
I used to hustle man, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: little dope boy, whatever makes an extra
dollar here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in Kentucky, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, you know, let me let me bring
this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, they seem to see what I'm
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see I'm talking about Kim Dogg and I
do it for Kim Dogg.
[SPEAKER_00]: She like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, like, you don't know what Kim
Dogg is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who the fuck are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, dude, you don't have the D like you
don't have the 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have the sis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't fuck around with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know anything about Kim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, you wanted me to come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanted me to come out here and tell
the story of how what I know about Kim and
[SPEAKER_00]: how far back it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But tell me about Kim Pham, Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that is that what we're talking about
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm trying to get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Rambo, I always like I said,
I dabble a little bit and like growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wouldn't even consider myself
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a third generation grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, my my granddad smuggled, you know,
a lot of like brick, wheat and shit up
[SPEAKER_00]: from Mexico on the back of a Harley
Davidson.
[SPEAKER_00]: She liked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad, he did a little bit of whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so like I consider myself a third
generation smuggler if I'm going to eat
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, through my connections and
shit hustling back in Kentucky,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in the streets and and all that,
I got I made a couple of connections and
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my good buddies, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ain't gonna say his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just call him Tinker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tink Tink Tink Tink.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Tink Tink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and him, we ran around, you know,
like if I was ever dry, I'd go to him if
[SPEAKER_00]: he was dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in Kentucky, bro, you have like
these crazy dry spells back in the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: day, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nuts like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ain't trying to have no real fucking
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to really live like that and
just hustle and, you know, fuck around
[SPEAKER_00]: with the girls and just smoke big blunts
and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're going to make fun of my
blunts, but I like blunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, my buddy Tink Tink, like I said,
we fuck around for years and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking like childhood shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been smoking weed together on and
off since like eight, nine years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he's the first guy to smoke cigarettes
with like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: First guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and he we've ran trains on his girls,
all kinds of shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, when you're like 10,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just like all the time,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout high school, shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, long story short to the Kim shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've we've fucked around with a lot of
plans, but the main thing I wanted to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about here, because I see a lot of your
stories on your little videos,
[SPEAKER_00]: people talking about him, Kim Pham,
where did it come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it that, you know, all this stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to say my piece,
my piece, you know, like I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anyways, Tink Tink, he's cool with
ICP.
[SPEAKER_00]: If y'all don't know what I'm talking
about, insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Juggalo life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know anything about, you know,
you know about the Juggalo life,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know a little bit about the Juggalo life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, he's like cool with them or
some are like banging one of the dudes
[SPEAKER_00]: like sisters or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't fucking really remember,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been like 20 plus years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is 96, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like they're kind of ICP is like
been around since like 89.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they they're like kind of underground
at this point, kind of blowing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not really like mainstream mainstream
where they're doing like house parties,
[SPEAKER_00]: shit like that in the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's fucking feels and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still wearing makeup, bro,
like I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even see them, bro, like I just
showed up for the after party shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I don't really fucking listen
to that music.
[SPEAKER_00]: No disrespect to them or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so Tink Tink's like,
bro, you got to get down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I say this, it's Tallahassee,
Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone, every time I fucking say this,
I'm like, dude, don't you mean Florida?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, no, I actually mean Tennessee,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bum fuck town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like three buildings out in the
middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, ICP is out there playing a
show, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why aren't they?
[SPEAKER_00]: I get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get lost, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even get to see the fucking show,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pissed, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then, bro, I look like I do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I had weed on me, but it was like
up under the underneath my truck and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I didn't smoke like all the way
down there from Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took like fucking six hours to get
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get lost and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Missed it a little like house party show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get there and, you know,
Tink Tink's been blowing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ain't got no fucking service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get there, though, and I randomly start
getting service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he hit me up like, bro, you got to get
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blood is crazy, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's girls with big titties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would imagine Juggalo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like said, I didn't see them or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were already gone, but the after
party was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pulled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meet with Tink Tink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start like mingling with the people and
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they got fucking booze.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beer, weed, like hard stuff like these
guys are going crazy, bro, like titties
[SPEAKER_00]: out all this shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pros have their titties out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't want to get canceled
nowadays, but let's have their boobs out,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm fucking I'm like 22, bro,
like this fucking, you know, anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: Tink Tink's, you know, like, dude,
like, you know, get, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: chill, whatever, have a good time,
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm mingling and stuff because a lot of
these guys like our dealers and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of my space because I'm
trying to get in, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know how it is when you're fucking
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want you always want to like have
somebody else like another dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: another plug or whatever you want to call
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody you can kind of tap into just in
case your people get, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: something happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've had plenty of times where my
people have gone to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need a new like a new guy or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm always trying to mingle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking to myself like ICP like
it's a band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they got like some back then in
Kentucky, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't get good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so hard to get good smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm on a mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had good smoke a few times and I'm on a
mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tracking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going out of state doing runs here or
there, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to my point, Tink Tink party and all
that ICP.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't really care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a good time mingling with some
girl, getting some phone numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing too crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, you know, when you're at a party,
bro, and there's like a party in the party
[SPEAKER_00]: and like when you're like like you want to
be in there, sometimes you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be in there because it might be like like
straight up dude undo banging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens at some of these parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: The party at the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go into this fucking shack, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a glorified shack, basically,
you know, and these fucking cats in there
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking of smoking some hard shit or
whatever, because it's like that vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Waving me in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on in here, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mouse to me like so nobody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's where I slide in there real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walk in, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a fucking a fucking fog
machine, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's gone off in this fucking room,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm choking up, bro, because like I
said, my eyes are watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking there's something fucking
foul in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, what are you doing in here,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had these glasses on and didn't really
realize it because I was fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real dark in there and shit already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sit down for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sit down with these cats and I'm
like, you know, I'm thinking to myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, what's so fucking special about this
weed that like nobody else can be in on
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, they're like,
shut the door, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking to myself, I want the
girls to come in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's me, Tink, Tink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these three cats I've never met
in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, you know, got the tray
out and rolling up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, all I know, I look in this weed like
it's hit me like, what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells the weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the stinkiest, like gaseous,
like foul.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know how to describe it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, 20 years ago, it's hard to
even put it put it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't even want to try to,
like, you know, put it in the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was some of the best weed I had
ever seen at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, start passing joints from
back and forth and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit it as soon as I hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dying, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And me, I back then, I'm fucking like
borderline crackhead back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me to cough up a joint,
you know, I was like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, is this is this shit straight?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what's in this, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm thinking like my friend got
dusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Tink Tink, he's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these cats are like real rednecks
like out in the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like with, you know, weaponry and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, dude, there's nothing in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hitting it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like within five, 10 minutes,
I just feel this like like buzz come over
[SPEAKER_00]: me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a head buzz, like a body buzz,
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sitting here like kind of freaking
the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, but I didn't want them to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I'm a new guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you got to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to be cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and Tink Tink on the way down there,
he's like, dude, these cats are like big
[SPEAKER_00]: shit, bro, like deadhead, like all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I didn't really know what that meant
at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like looking back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, I mean, I'm hitting this
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, bro, what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, like Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, yeah, like Kim, like chemical
dog, Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Kim dog, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of name is that, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be honest to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like now it's it's it sounds cool to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then, I thought it was kind of
lame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I could see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Tink Tink's like, bro,
this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm hitting it or whatever,
getting fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then, you know, Maine didn't have
names back then, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the fact that it had a name to us,
like redneck boys from Kentucky,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're like, oh, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I didn't like the name,
but I was like I was enjoying enjoying the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, having to just do just do
just do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at some point, like I'm kind of
feeling a little nauseous when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking like, dude, there's beautiful
women here like like it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate y'all smoking me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I already had my weed with me and all
shit and Tink Tink.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me a little nug or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I go back out to the party and
start kicking these girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucked up for like three or four
hours, shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to bed next day, wake up, go home,
hit Tink Tink up like, dude, what the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: did I smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I had all kinds of shit up for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like it didn't really hit me until
like the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that was that was fucking that was
it, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit Tink Tink up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And where can I get it, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, Kim, the hoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah, dude, what's the shit
we smoked last night?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, you know, talking about
like, oh, you know, I can't meet these
[SPEAKER_00]: guys and they're a big deal, shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he said, he said, I'll give you your
phone number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave me some fucking fake name or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then, like, you know,
on the Internet, she like our discourse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I call his do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like real shady, awkward
conversation talking about how he sent him
[SPEAKER_00]: five hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: He will give me a zip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking myself a zip for five hundred
fucking dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm twenty twenty two,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like fucking wisdom and hustling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like to me, like like brick,
we like back in the day, like three
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred, three fifty for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I make good money back then from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, it's a gamble.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was like, I'll hit him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you, I like I'll hit you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think about it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try hitting him back up like two,
three fucking weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This motherfucker don't answer his phone,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking like I don't piss him off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You meet a new guy and you're like,
dude, trying especially when you're young,
[SPEAKER_00]: because like these cats were older than
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you know, I don't want to
fucking look like a nerd to these dudes or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You definitely don't want to look like a
nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just played it cool, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I don't like that third week I'm
calling like, dude, I started calling a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of times a day where finally this
motherfucker answers like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, it threw me for a loop because
I've called so many times and fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you know, I sound like a
little girl, like a voice crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, who the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you get this number?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to spend like 30 minutes
explaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, like I've already talked to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You told me this, this price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, the price jumps up six
hundred dollars an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at this point, I'm already in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the dude and I was like,
I might not hear from this fucking dude
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, I will mail it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me some weird fucking address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I send it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it's like I'm waiting like three
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I just got ripped off,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three months, three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom, my mom, my mom had just gotten
divorced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like she what she's working a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wasn't on my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was still living with my mom and dad,
like my dad would have been on it and seen
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she knocked on my door when I was
still living with her, like hustling out
[SPEAKER_00]: that crib or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, there's a there's a
package here for some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget what name I use or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just hit me like, oh, oh, that's for
more of my friends or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she gave me the package and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go to open it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like before I even open the box,
I can smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: And my my dad fucked with weed and hustle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like my mom's like kind of churchy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: She don't know nothing about weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but she's like, what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I got a guy that was fucking
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was like, what's that smell or
whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just fucking with it because I
fuck with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, it's the Kim doll,
mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, she didn't know what she had to
say.
[SPEAKER_03]: She didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was OK with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like she's she's cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my mom, she's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live with her right now, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's cool, but she's texted me to a few
times trying to get you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought you were trying to joke on my
mom's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about to say we have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, no, she really did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have her come up here, but she's doing
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's kind of but she's kind of an
airhead, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is, my mom's an airhead
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I was growing one of my first
girls ever not to get off on a tangent,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I was growing like PC grow like in
little boxes to box grows in my closet,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like fucking sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 fucking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I don't like I don't consider
myself a girl because I've like I've
[SPEAKER_00]: started to grow so many fucking times,
bro, and would get to a point where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm about to flower, you know,
and I'd be renting a house or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like where I'm at, you get caught with
weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're where I was at growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to fucking jail big time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Landlords show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like I never really consider myself a
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just that's why I naturally
gravitated gravitated towards like the
[SPEAKER_00]: hustling aspect of it, just trying to make
a dollar or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, back to my story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send the money off.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom dropped the package off in the
room, stinking up the crib and shit like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, thank God.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is me and my mom living together this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, greatest experience in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greatest weed, same weed that I had at the
fucking ICP little like party shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ain't no fucking diddy party either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people in the chat, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, they're fucking around up
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just chill shit like back in the
day, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just guys and girls is so orgy shit,
but not like diddy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I find a few seeds in this jar,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like two or three or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like kind of dabbling and growing
here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking, like, this is fucking
the best weed ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then, bro, like, like some was
like B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depot or some some of the Canadians.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit was sketchy, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a knock on my door before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ordered seeds from them before from
Canada, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the postal people would knock on
the door and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my dad would be like, I didn't use
fake names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my dad would be like, why the fuck are
they like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is what is this shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like so I could never successfully
get seeds to where I was at, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like in my mind, I'm using bag seeds
and I'm like, dude, this is the best bag
[SPEAKER_00]: seed I ever fucking seen in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I hit the do's back up thinking
like, man, I need more of this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know they're like, like a month or
two fucking around another six hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get I get another zip in between
these two zips, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come out with like 20 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after I pop them all, I end up with 15
seeds, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I call it sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 15 is what I call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim, 15 is whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, each one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know at the time like CSI and
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know about like, you know,
Kim for Kim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know about that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like looking back now, I feel dumb
because like, do they really matter?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those other ones that came out,
do they matter when you've got someone
[SPEAKER_03]: through 15?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't speak on them because I never
grown them in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like what like from what I was what I
knew at that point, no, there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: Internet or shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you ain't talking to nobody about this
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like you got to, you know,
most of them, you got to especially where
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at, you got to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You splice like middleman shit,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not you're not like talking
about this shit to nobody, really,
[SPEAKER_00]: other than maybe maybe like one person
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so I get the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call them 15 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I start growing these seeds or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm taking cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on like 420 Chan or I was like,
oh, I don't know, like I'm terrible at
[SPEAKER_00]: dates, but like overgrow and all the shit
started slowly coming out over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, yeah, I learned about like
cloning and like, you know, propagation
[SPEAKER_00]: and like how to, you know, how to keep
genetics alive and the importance of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm reading on there and I've seen
these cats on her talking about like Kim
[SPEAKER_00]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it freaked me the fuck out,
honestly, because I ain't trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: register to like the you know,
I didn't want to really register and be on
[SPEAKER_00]: there like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did like the self docs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm reading on there like about Kim
and Kim 91 and the D and the sis and like
[SPEAKER_00]: all this shit is blowing my fucking mind
because I'm like, is this the same shit
[SPEAKER_00]: that I got or like what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking like, what the fuck do I
got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of like hit me on this quest,
bro, to like, you know, meet up with cats
[SPEAKER_00]: like y'all and try the different the
different Kim's out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the years, of course,
I've traded different shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, this is about the Kim.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get we'll get another shit maybe in
another podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, over the years,
I've traded other shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up getting the sis,
the D, the 91, you know, and like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got packs from CSI, number one in the
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ain't fucking popped them yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so as I'm going through, you know,
the year always, you know, 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 years, I'm like reading this shit and
like kind of, you know, just like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: just want to know what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get with a few cats from the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, everything I got is legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the all the cuts I got were real deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We compared, you know, compared notes,
notes and cuts and tried each other
[SPEAKER_00]: samples and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the interesting thing, dude,
is my one through 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fucking they're so close to all
the different cuts, but they're I would
[SPEAKER_00]: argue that they're a step above all these
because like that would make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, even on CSI's website, bro,
if you go in and read about the 91 S ones
[SPEAKER_00]: and shit like that, he says, dude,
make sure you take a cut because these are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to probably be better and can
produce better cuts than the parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking maybe the 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking some of these cats got S ones
and or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I don't know, because I do got a
little bit of variation in my 15,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they do have that chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that rotten, just fucking tomato
rotten flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not good at describing sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke too much tobacco and shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he cares about turps anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's kind of, you know, kind of
where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've been wanting to come out
recently and I see a lot of these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to mention any names or
whatever, but people in the game or in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry that maybe it brought him to the
forefront.
[SPEAKER_00]: She like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on here talking about runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: White runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: No disrespect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw you did your white runs,
Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not listening on yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to play the game to win.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but what all I'm saying, bro,
is that I feel like a disrespecting chem,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: My chems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see you come to that conclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ain't even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not even about my chems,
bro, because I ain't selling my shit and
[SPEAKER_00]: ain't none of y'all getting no fucking cut
to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be asking me shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be asking him, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but at the end of the day,
these guys out here fucking smoking mylar
[SPEAKER_00]: bags, booty hole runs and shit like that,
acting like it's the bees knees,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember when when good weed was
green, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, used to be these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember when people talked about like
sour hazes, OG types, OG typers,
[SPEAKER_00]: typers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can't you can't find the OG no
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, people want that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my thought is these cats that brought
chem dogs to the forefront, they ain't
[SPEAKER_00]: really respecting chem like they should,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my thing is, I want to start a
movement where we get chem back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: forefront, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys out here talking about chem
auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's not respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ain't respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: No disrespect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, this generation coming up
right now, they need to know what the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: is up with chem, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It don't matter if it's since D 91,
one bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, that's I see people we wanted to
bring this up because people are shitting
[SPEAKER_00]: on me in my in the DMS talking about,
I don't know what the fuck what the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: do I know about chem, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I allow all I want to know is what the
fuck y'all know about chem, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I challenge any one of them guys get out
here and talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, anyone of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, it's scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's that's really it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you got questions for me about
it, I'll try to fill you in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll tell people all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know fucking everything,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I sure do fucking know a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I I joined up with y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm being thrilled, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I joined up with y'all because I want to
get better at growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, you know, that's why I'm
here, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the past like probably,
I don't know, 10 years, I've been like
[SPEAKER_00]: said, I consider myself a girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like really, since I've been out and
before I got locked up again, I was really
[SPEAKER_00]: going hard at it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's basically it on the chem
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, one of the most
interesting questions I thought since
[SPEAKER_03]: you're talking about being a third
generation smuggler, we have a guy called
[SPEAKER_03]: Sheets on Fire asking your first prison
smuggle.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that experience like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all going to call me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you get locked up, bro,
and you're looking at like losing
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, you'll do some wild ass shit,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll put shit in your.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, let's just be real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, geez.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I've loathed straight up keistered
loath some stuff up my butt, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ain't going to say what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I put stuff on my butt many times,
you know, being locked up, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: like, especially I know I'm going in there
for the weekend, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am putting shit up my ass, bro,
because I know I could go in there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking like, dude, I could take a half
zip in there, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come out with three grand, dude,
like like for real, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they know me in there, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guards and shit are like, yo,
they're like, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: January 7th, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like invite me in type shit like let
me do what I want to do, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's insane, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I could go in on the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, the fucking steel riders in the
window wars in there love me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that, dude, people who
don't know what that shit is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to explain it to you real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, a fucking window warrior is somebody
when you go to jail, bro, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking they get me in and you walking
back to the sale, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no glass, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some jails, you know how they got the
glass right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get taken back and they're just pacing
back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's usually one guy, maybe two guys
and not really the biggest cat ever
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're just what they got their shirt
off and they look fucking deranged and
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're walking back and forth and
like doing this shit to their glass and
[SPEAKER_00]: like sizing you up, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you see them in the fucking
you get in there with them, bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they get out of a lock up,
they get in there with on the floor with
[SPEAKER_00]: you and shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They walk up to you like, hey,
man, my name's Steve, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like the hardest cat you ever in the
window steel rider is somebody that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: give a fuck straight up will sit on a
steel toilet in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got steel toilets, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because they don't want you
making shit with whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sale, bro, I'm sharing one toilet
with 40 caps, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: A steel rider is a guy and I guess a girl
maybe because let's not be be like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's twenty twenty four, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there will sit raw dog on their night
and clean it off like dirty shit all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the rim of the toilet and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't even get in front.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's how you you earn your steel
rider wings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you gotten them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we shouldn't go into depth about it,
but once my my my bunkie, he made some
[SPEAKER_00]: moonshine, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm getting hot as fuck,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: My man, I see that my my bunkie one time,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made some moonshine, dude, out of like
some fucking Kool-Aid and some I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got we got lit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you ask?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm getting off on a tangent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was about your first prison smuggling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you covered it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Keister, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keister did every anything and everything
because everything in jail is worth like
[SPEAKER_00]: five times more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, if you want to talk about some
smuggling shit in in there, like most of
[SPEAKER_00]: us happen like when you go like you want
to be part of like work release,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: We get on the roads, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's fucking people that will just
drive up to you, bro, and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, y'all are out here killing it in the
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of what y'all doing,
you know, serving your time and fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: just hand you like a fifth or something,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hand you other shit, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ain't going to bring that up,
though, because, you know, priors or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but yeah, the best time is when you're
out there cleaning up that trash on the
[SPEAKER_00]: highway, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like shit goes down, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: A cat a cat can get fellatio.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make, dude, bro, you can make a
lot of money in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just even doing work release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, work release shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually get in a fight, though,
bro, and run that quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you start licking yourself up
and getting out there in the heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to get pissed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially you got cats in there that are
fucking detoxing, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever been in the pen with somebody's
come out that shit, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not in the pen, but I've definitely
been around the detoxers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I can get my pant leg up,
bro, but I actually got a fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got stabbed, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see that scar?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that stabbed you in your shin,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to kick this dude, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He bit me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a stab.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, smuggling, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to talk about some smuggling
real quick, I can get some tips real quick
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep y'all out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in YouTube land, that might not work
so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I don't want you catching any heat
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was behind me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm I'm free and clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a legal state now, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do legal shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm up in my bed, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: First prison cuddle from the power for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's a nice question or
unauthorized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, I would fucking fight somebody
asking that shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you like the juicy details.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the only time I've ever held a
fucking man in jail, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was when my cellmates moaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife was in there and his fucking baby
mama got killed, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he cried like a baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I held him and he held me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're in there, bro, the
motherfuckers are your family,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's OK to hold each other
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, dude, I've kissed a guy in jail,
bro, like they look I swear to God look
[SPEAKER_00]: dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, better than any girl you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can promise you anywhere out where the
fuck you're at, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are dudes in there on another level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get anything in there,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like on the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to pay for it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kind of pay for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to come in with the big money,
big money jams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone asked the first time you had to
knock a grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what that's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knock a grow like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Knock knock a grow over, I think like like
get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, take someone's stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, my mom, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me think about that because you
know how to do it in small towns.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think like people always do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to get into a people they think
like, oh, you know, you ain't done the
[SPEAKER_00]: city fool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there ain't nothing you ain't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what that life's about,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like where I grew up, bro,
like you had like crews just like you got
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like way more personal or
personal because like you went to school
[SPEAKER_00]: with these guys, like every one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all of them, you know,
all the dudes or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like it's sketch, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like like out there, bro, a lot of
times you mean these guys in like back
[SPEAKER_00]: roads, like nobody around, you know,
pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, anyways, back to knocking grows off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really do a lot of that because,
bro, that's not really my style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of times I just hustle for what
I what I needed and did it the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the right way I could do for
hustling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, I will say the one I can share
again is my stepdad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he was my stepdad, my mom's
boyfriend for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude, I will say his name or
whatever, but he kind of fucked around or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever and was like growing weed back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my mom's like duplex or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't know anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of dumb for me to even
steal it, really, because like it died
[SPEAKER_00]: like right away, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he had like some plants out there and
me and my homies, he's a dick or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: like kind of like an asshole to my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stole we stole his plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, they died, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say, you know,
when I was in high school, bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: me and me and my buddies were growing next
to the railroad tracks a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really take credit for it because
I mean, I just be there smoking weed or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these other guys that were kind of
cool just like end up stealing our plants
[SPEAKER_00]: because this dude in our group kind of
like ratted out our spot and they took
[SPEAKER_00]: like our plants and then they started
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like we found out where their
spot was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went and took their shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's about it, really,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really steal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a stealer, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not into all that, really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't you don't really look like a
thief, I would say more like an upstanding
[SPEAKER_03]: citizen.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, my mom, my dad and my granddad always
told me, though, like one thing you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking do is steal, you know,
steal people's shit, bro, because it might
[SPEAKER_00]: come around on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, dealing with people with
addictions, bro, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a lot of my stuff stolen a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I work hard, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've had jobs and shit,
too, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned Quiznos, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mowed grass for a living for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking I've modeled a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a time, I can see that you're doing it
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get the sponsors to hook me
the fuck up, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for weed, you know, I see these guys
trying to make it come up off the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: game all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking like, dude, I need my piece,
too, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I did my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you mentioned that in the texts
as did your your relative who kept texting
[SPEAKER_03]: me, blowing me up to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I appreciate you finally giving me
the nod, like, like, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought you were bullshitting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept telling my mom, like, Matt is
coming through, bro, bro, just like that
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce of the Kim back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I got impatient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got a problem, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a little problem with the
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got AC or ACDC or whatever it's called.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's my Kim story, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And smuggling as far as smuggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a lot of smuggling, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll just keep it at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, since we're live, if anybody has any
questions from the audience for Chuckie,
[SPEAKER_03]: get it in there right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask away and I'll keep my eye on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got the discord questions loaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Logan, my name is Logan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chuck and Paul, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: My real name ain't even Logan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't want to say your real name on
the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a question from Scrooge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scrooge, what's he want?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got three questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: First question is, can I touch your
butthole?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm guessing he's talking to you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's talking to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was this was actually for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only time another man ever touched my
ass when he's having the keys to something
[SPEAKER_00]: I've right from going in, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: On accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got that one friend you called it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will help you because he's been
through the same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, have you had have you had any
experience or experiences harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: something earlier than usual?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, lots of times, bro, when you're
making seeds, especially, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some people like to take their clones,
you know, some people like to start with
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed, grow it out, clone it,
you know, and work from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do it a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to I'll take a plant, the seed
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll grow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of taking clones immediately
and just scrapping the bomb plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of want to see what the mom's going
to do, just what the bud's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, what she's you know, what she's
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll I'll go ahead and take that
up when you're working with regs,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take that opportunity to go ahead
since I got the mail usually right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go ahead and use that opportunity to
hit hit him with something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get some kind of seed out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm not only going to have clones,
but I'm going to have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds of stuff, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as, you know, take your stuff
early, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing a seed run, sometimes when
you're making a seed for yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when you ain't selling seed and
you only want so many, if you do it early
[SPEAKER_00]: enough and you don't the bud, maybe the
bud isn't what you want it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe whatever, you know, you can run
into problems, pests, maybe even or even
[SPEAKER_00]: you're outside and you don't want to run
into certain weather conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are times where you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mainly for me, like I've taken shit
when I just want to get the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I check to see if I got enough mature
seeds that I want and I'll go and take it
[SPEAKER_00]: and just have my cones going or a revenge
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, there's times you could
do that for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about you, Matt?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're pretty much covered.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just watching your your blunt rolling
skills here and seeing if you really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can roll a blunt in about 26 seconds,
but this fucking weed I got right now is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like real fluffy like haze like,
you know, in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to pack it thicker and I
probably need to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what was that first thing you smoked
out of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that was that food that you do spam?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was about to munch on this fucking
sandwich, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom got me some sandwiches and shit,
but then I got to I was about to hit that
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was thinking, yeah, I'm like,
maybe I shouldn't eat on the podcast or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom, she's good, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a bagel sandwich?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that egg bagel?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a steak grinder or what do you call
them, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Up here in Michigan, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make the subs up here, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Kentucky, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a red.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the fucking shit is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a website called Grindr.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's grinders, all kinds of sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's a it's a sub, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like grill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got steak and cheese and peppers and
shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it's fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you keep that figure eating stuff
like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, it's from fucking working on these
plants all goddamn day, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't work out or nothing at all,
bro, but I'm I'm free.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even in the pen, like you don't get
your sets in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did in the pen, but now, like,
I got some shit going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, make a dollar, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's the main focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like working out is one thing,
but making a dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's jump back to the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christian says, besides blue stuff,
what hybrids are you most excited about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking through and why?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's me or you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's probably you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think you like blue, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you are a blue champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got blue, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got a I got a few jars of blue,
a couple of jars of blue on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the very I X.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got three of them on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to pull out at some point here
if we had time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have rolled that in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit seeded, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did see it with the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, you know, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but for the answer to his question,
besides the blue stuff, what hybrids are
[SPEAKER_00]: you most excited about looking through and
why?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, for blue, I mean, he said
besides blue stuff, but blue stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: the blue resin, I think is probably my
next thing or maybe the was blue sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because like I do like I do like that
blue flavor, man, like the like the but I
[SPEAKER_00]: want someone a little bit more potent,
I will say.
[SPEAKER_00]: My particular expressions, I got I like
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is great on the I X.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think like I did hit that's why I
hit them, because I figure I would have to
[SPEAKER_00]: hunt them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, like I did get some really nice
color, but not the color I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, yeah, I made enough to like hunt
through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But most hybrids most excited for bro,
I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I just cut down my rank stranger
from H&L.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had two of them outside, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody said, is it Gojo or Mojo,
the orange hand hand cleaner stuff that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of gritty that mechanics use?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not real orange smell, but it does
have that orange citrus kind of smell to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the plants, one of the rank
changers got that like chemically like
[SPEAKER_00]: like orange kind of like hand soapy kind
of smell, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not soap so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that I think it's Gojo is what they
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm excited about smoking as far as
growing shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing a lot of a lot of stuff from
the guys from the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm excited about everything I'm
growing, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only grow shit I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, I'm not wasting time
doing anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm excited about it all,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know if I'm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, we can jump to some next
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, let's do the next questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's list a bunch of shit off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you could go back to one line you
made and start a new project from it,
[SPEAKER_00]: what would it be from Sean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd probably do the strawberry cream stuff
again, which is which is still Barry,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I guess I guess that's where I
reside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you like I know you've talked about a
little bit here and there, but from years
[SPEAKER_00]: of doing drugs, bro, my memory is
terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that name just the name to get people
to buy it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or does it does it have like a strawberry
cream?
[SPEAKER_03]: Super, super, super strawberry super CVF
got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was a strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one from a lady named Golden Eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was like, you know,
it's the Internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't really know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Golden Eyes was on the forums back in
the day and she did some strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: S ones that had males.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, that's where it came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it did carry a much stronger
strawberry expression than even strawberry
[SPEAKER_03]: cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the flavor was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd probably go back and do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you have you had the most question
from me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you messed with CSI's S ones of the
cough?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but it would probably be a good,
almost a better place to look because it
[SPEAKER_03]: would be more pure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I think that the Golden Eyes stuff
was probably a pollen contamination with
[SPEAKER_03]: all the males in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Word.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, yeah, I think I picked some of them up
or a pack of it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed that one when I locked up,
bro, for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: That happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully mom grabbed you some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mom, she don't really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say mom?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, your mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully she grabbed me some.
[SPEAKER_00]: She don't smoke really that much,
but she will go buy seeds from out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I either use her money a lot of times,
you know, because especially when I first
[SPEAKER_00]: got out, you know, got to help take EBT
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: First, what is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeds?
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anybody take EBT for Seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I do got an EBT card, but I don't even
use it, bro, because I'm like my ego and
[SPEAKER_00]: shit, because like I can't just like
accept that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'll fucking hustle my shit up,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I hustled you on to the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we're here, bro, right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump into some more questions,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dogs and Trees says, what was the line
slash cultivar that made you decide to go
[SPEAKER_00]: all in on breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd imagine the bonnet stuff, but maybe it
started before that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, I know it was Hogs Breath,
Hogs Breath, the old San Diego Hogs
[SPEAKER_03]: Breath.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I started really learning
about breeding, breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Clockwork Orange is the best Fem
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was when I really, really tried to
nail down a line.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Hogs Breath stuff from Jimbo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the Hogs Breath like, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the turds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anywhere from Cheesy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen Fruity Expressions in the S1s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Foot Fonk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to explain, but like even how
Shoreline can go through those fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: different, I don't know, trying to
reference another old rare clone is kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of hard for most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I know what you're talking about,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that kind of like it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the shit I've been fucking with
recently has got this almost like a
[SPEAKER_00]: fermented, ocean-y like smell,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Irene S1s from CSI, I just did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only had three to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the packs were like $300 fucking
dollars, so I only got one pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had one that came out like that,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would pull it up here, but we get like
fucking YouTube strikes just every time we
[SPEAKER_00]: show any kind of weed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I've actually got clones of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, my point was it had that like
funky, like the only thing that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe, you know, maybe that's what it is,
basically.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: The actual clone though is Foot Funky
Cheesy, but not like Cheese the Clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was its own little unique, indicate
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you still have any of the work that you
did with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: The last stuff I had, I gave to Bitter,
and he has.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the Master Hogs Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was SoCal Master, which is like a
Bubba, Northern Lights type.
[SPEAKER_03]: OG Kush and Hogs Breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Bitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a real one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Salute him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think, you know, I can't
really comment on that, but I think one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the first packs that I popped,
bro, was from CSI that made me like want
[SPEAKER_00]: to dive deep into just learning more about
weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think, I don't know,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was just sitting there thinking
about that from not really a breeder's
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, but just wanted to know more
about the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I popped I think it was like Girl Scout
Cookies, Cali-O, something else that had
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten in a trade that were CSI stuff,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I popped them, you know,
I've been fucking with autos a lot at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I popped them, I was like,
damn, dude, like these are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just remember the Girl Scout Cookies
were cool because I grew them like four or
[SPEAKER_00]: five of them in a small, like two by two
was like 100 watt light, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was like some of the densest,
like it grew so well in there under that
[SPEAKER_00]: low light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just worked great, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made me kind of be like,
damn, this shit's cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You like the cookies, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a cookies fan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at the time, you know, when you're
talking about autos, I mean, you fuck with
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly like autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kim's the only other thing I've had
really that I've kept this long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like I love Kim.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over the years, I've tried stuff,
you know, because you know how it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before the Internet and Discord,
I get conned into buying all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these cats out here telling me like
this is the new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is better than Kim and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to try to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even get high, bro, anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to the, I went to these fucking
disposed or whatever up here, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're talking about like the dude,
you know, I mean, dude out front,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, bro, you trying to get a free joint
on it of the run?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie, I smoked bunk,
bro, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit, we all do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, just fucking ain't
nothing like good Kim or OG, Sauer,
Hayden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lazy type shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm still learning, but anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, y'all got to remember, I locked up a
lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I get out, some cat might say
like, yo, this is fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried and this is fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, we got Frankie Danky says,
if you could travel back in time for one
[SPEAKER_00]: year, what you in time for one year,
what year are you choosing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are you bringing back with you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, bring back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking about traveling to,
I don't know, bringing back, I bring back
[SPEAKER_03]: real blueberry now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd probably go to Humboldt,
1978.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even the Pacific Northwest,
1978.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is either early Afghani infestation.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what that shit would like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably go back to when Rob Clark,
I've hung out with Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you guys friends?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shared a fishing trip together.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is I love to go back and meet him
when he was my age back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 20 year old dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hang out with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go back and see the early Pearl.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff would be cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is usually a thousandth job,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's asking me questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is supposed to be about you,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, anyways, we'll make it
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a question for you from I can
never, did you do whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can never say a shit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you started smoking again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very slowly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very slowly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to read.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone sent some of the, I think they
call it swampy blue in the end,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is the white cross to blue bonnet
and then some of the blue and cross to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Making sure I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I had a few, I had a few close
calls at the beginning where I was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm starting to get sick and pukey.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's okay again.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just might've been nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're back amongst the smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, people's, you know, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so we got, uh, am I, you know,
I, you know, your boy's always smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got another one from dogs and trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says which settings for age,
location, preferences, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I put my grinder on for the best
chance and matching with Matt guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I settings for the grinder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got, you got Matt, the blueberry
fucking King on here right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about fucking grinder,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is grinder anyway?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, you don't want to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't heard of this site.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a site?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's the connections.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, we got one from bittersweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The OG King.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pauline timing in regular breeding
difference in like short flowering and
[SPEAKER_00]: long flowering on how it affects seed
production.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you know, like usually like in my
brain, I put it between 10 to 14 weeks or
[SPEAKER_03]: actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eight to 10, sometimes seven, which is
rare as fuck the seven to 10 and then 10
[SPEAKER_03]: to 14.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you got 14 to 22 kind of,
and you're like pulling to hit usually at
[SPEAKER_03]: four weeks for the, for the Afghani
dominant type, which is almost everything
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll see, you know, unless people are
going to smoking like haze hybrids,
[SPEAKER_03]: like real haze hybrids, uh, 10 to 14 or
some of the more hazy hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're talking about like,
um, like even the mango hay stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: the, the electrical glue, mango haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's from hand lonesome stuff like that
hit seven, six range.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then longer than that, dude,
you can hit it 10, 11, 12, cause that shit
[SPEAKER_03]: will just flower forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once it goes longer than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I thought this was a good
question from my, from what I had for a
[SPEAKER_00]: Chanel and maybe you can speak on it too,
but you know, something I didn't realize
[SPEAKER_00]: was, you know, or it's not even a
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's more something you can speak
on, but I didn't realize that if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing outside and you get maybe by
accident or on purpose, you get seeded bud
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, that can cause like bud
rot and shit, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I didn't ever even like,
cause you know, you think like,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a natural process, like kind of in
a way, maybe not natural, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, I never, I never knew that that,
that was a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talked to H&L about it and he's
like, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you could get bud rot or rot from
just the seed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said before, the fucking seed
will grow up out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it looks like alien bud,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it has a bunch of the tap roots
flying out all over the bud white.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen that, but that's,
that is wild, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as, you know, uh, auto pollen,
maybe if people care about that,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll speak on some auto shit in this
podcast, dude, your boy, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: at one time, but as far as autos,
I mean, dude, some of the males,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially like you're more like you were
saying, the more intricate types,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you call them or dominant
varieties, shorter, shorter types or
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter flower period autos, if that makes
any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, uh, they're, I mean, dude,
males are dropping anywhere from like day
[SPEAKER_00]: 21 to like, like I'm like serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had, yeah, like real fast,
dude, week, week three to week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then, you know, your females
usually can take around there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe a little bit like week four,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, and then they're, they're just
like your normal plants as far as the time
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes them to mature for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just let them run as long as they need
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do what you taught me to do,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, you've always told me
growing up back in the day, bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't check the top, but check the bottom
ones, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, if the bottom ones,
if they're mature, the rest of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: The top ones always first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's inner knuckle elbow ones,
I think called primordial.
[SPEAKER_03]: Primordial seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are always done first.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're tricky.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see those come and you're like,
Oh, nice and Brown, nice and you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: sturdy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the rest can be all immature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I thought was kind of
interesting, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to know what none of your
audience probably just fuck about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I thought it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some autos, bro, that I,
that I chuck some pollen on, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I chuck some, your blueberry IX onto a
blueberry auto, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what would you say the primordial?
[SPEAKER_00]: Primordial shit like the, I hit those with
the auto pollen, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause guys in the chat can be a
contamination, contamination, but I got
[SPEAKER_00]: the answer for you fucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you, you could do some cool shit like
that though, because you take,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, you hit the autos or you
could do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it both with both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me, let me, let me simplify this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got an auto blueberry,
you got the, and I, you could take,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do it either way, but I took the
male blueberry IX and hit it to the female
[SPEAKER_00]: primordials, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So every one of them, which ended up being
like 50 to a hundred, it's a hybrid of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I hit the rest of the top of the
buds with a male blueberry auto,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just as simple as like, I'm not
selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So contamination shit don't matter so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I, when I'm popping them at the
end of the day, I'm just popping,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if they start flowering early as
fuck, I know that the auto.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doubling up on two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever done anything like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know y'all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not with blueberry to blueberry autos,
but it's cause that's actually two
[SPEAKER_03]: different traits you're working at the
same time breeding for blue and breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: for auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a two observable traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not, it's not super complex,
but it's also pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I even think that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can tell which ones are pure and
which ones aren't just based on how they
[SPEAKER_03]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, something I appreciate about
you, dude, and working with the regs and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, especially man is like,
you got males around all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see cats, they'll cut them down as soon
as they start seeing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like for me, bro, like it's so easy to
just to separate a male for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got this face, right,
but you can separate a male and just do
[SPEAKER_00]: some brushing, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like why not, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not get some seeds out of that shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I tried keeping the bonnet male
for years and actually gave it away to
[SPEAKER_03]: radio rich so they can pass it to other
breeders that want it to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know that they ever did.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you keep cuts, like it's good to keep a
cut, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you fucking get locked up and
your homies like got an infestation or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, bro, your shit's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to have a seed of some kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't get that particular
expression back the way you want it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at least you got a jumping off coin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does Chucky have bottoms on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better watch out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I swole out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are swole.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you, like 6'10"?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking big motherfucker, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are a big motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you have males around you all the
time from the Don.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Don is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to the Don's Mozilla parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's well aware of having males.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like D.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the fucking man, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it wasn't for D, I wouldn't be here
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it wasn't for D, the Marines wouldn't
say Semper Fi.
[SPEAKER_00]: D's bailed me out of jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: D's gave me advice when I needed it,
when I got divorced.
[SPEAKER_00]: He taught me how to be a better father,
how to be a better grower, how to respect
[SPEAKER_00]: people better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, a person in the game
can fucking turn you, embrace it,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro, make you, I don't know, bro,
turn you into a hard ass motherfucker
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Hian Lutzen had a question for you
too, if I remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make sure we get that in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find it in the Discord.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking get lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to work it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it says, Chucky, have you ever grown
an auto that stacks up to top shelf
[SPEAKER_03]: traditional flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: See, this is a tricky question.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% transparency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fuck around and give y'all jokes all the
time, but I say it like this, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a pack of regs, like
traditional reg pack, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or phim, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most of the time, I don't know if you
can speak on this, but when you pop a pack
[SPEAKER_00]: of anything, really, there's always going
to be a plant in there or two,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe for the most part, unless you're
cookie fam.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everything's a fucking winner,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a pack, bro, you're going to find a
plant or two in there that's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at autos like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a pack of autos, if you pop the same
amount, sometimes you've got to pop a few
[SPEAKER_00]: more than like you would a normal pack,
I'll be for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you will find the best auto in there
will be close, comparable to maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: worst plant you find in a traditional
pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I see what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also will say this, you know,
they are definitely comparable to like
[SPEAKER_00]: tooky stuff, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, or wreck weed, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you going to get weed that you're
the most hideous weed that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, someone like H&L or whatever is
going to be like, this is it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not because that's, there's not
enough work in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need people like H&L and people like
that to work from further, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: He should start an auto.
[SPEAKER_03]: Company is what he needs to do next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he can speak on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, your worst, your best
auto is going to be like your worst plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say this, like, I get surprised
all the time about them, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I did fuck with them, I would get
surprised on a regular basis with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're dropping the weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're dropping the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's party, pal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hit some more of these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have the option S1, F1,
BX, which and why, pros and cons,
[SPEAKER_00]: why regard or with regardings with regards
to breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I can speak on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speak on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So BX and S1 is when you want to lock
something in, right?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: F1 is when you want to move forward most
of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's all I got, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say S1 is for making the money,
seeing recesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: BX1 is for making better money than F1.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then F1 is if you want to kill your
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autos if you want to make it back,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if you want to make your money back,
autos.
[SPEAKER_03]: On all the new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chuckie, what do you think of Kentucky
going medically legal?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like anywhere, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you're still looking at years of
probably waiting around, nemdicking you
[SPEAKER_00]: around for, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it's great, dude,
because like it is I think it's 21 or 22
[SPEAKER_00]: illnesses or I'm not good at this kind of
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, talking about medical
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long story short, like if you got cancer,
terminal illnesses, things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you can be on this list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's kind of silly, though,
is last time I checked, you had to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: care.
[SPEAKER_00]: You or your care provider has to drive out
of state and can bring back up to eight
[SPEAKER_00]: ounces legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to have, you know, all your proofs of
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like it's it's like, you know,
these people are like dying and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they need it now and not
tomorrow or in a week or.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're literally just driving over
from what I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe I'm wrong in this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from what I read, it's literally
you're just driving to, I guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: a medical facility and just picking up and
it's literally driving back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, why can't we have some
medical system to ship them to people are
[SPEAKER_00]: buying this T.H.A.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed or whatever be like, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a joke, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me and what I came from in my
background, it didn't really, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not really any effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like what I did or or would have
affected what I did at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do one more question and save the rest for
the next one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll bring you back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: See how your mom does with the bug in us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, see what we got to do when we're
here first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe while we're looking for a good
question, you got any cool projects coming
[SPEAKER_00]: up?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're doing this big overhaul in
doing that, maybe going a different
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
Overall, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but maybe you can speak on that
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any plans, any drops coming up?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have we have some seeds that Miss
Joe just sent in.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got we got the the Space Queen stuff
from her.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some pretty cool stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else we got coming in?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we still have the Blue Cross
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the sale still going on right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when I get unlazy and get back to
doing the site stuff instead of cleaning
[SPEAKER_03]: up my house, maybe I'll put it back up to
the normal price, but I haven't really
[SPEAKER_03]: remembered yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else do we got?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to do some FEM work
next, because, I mean, for years,
[SPEAKER_03]: people associated me with FEM stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I started doing regular stuff and
nobody wants regular stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to FEM stuff, you know, I don't know if
I'm going to do Blue FEM stuff because
[SPEAKER_03]: like, really, I'm just burning it to the
ground with blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you should be risking,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should try some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried some some modern stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could if you find the right,
you know, the right stuff, you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: something cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know, but maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I just don't like the taste of a
lot of cookies and like sherb stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like the sherb cream pie stuff that
the spindle had was really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we use that and some stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm particular.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe maybe back to strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to do FEM stuff, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you're doing, I'm for it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people want if you want a chance
to get in on some of Matt's new drops
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up, his new work or some of his old
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to save a dollar to join the
discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a 50 dollar tier in there for all
you guys and gals out there that want to
[SPEAKER_00]: save some money every two to three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt takes that monthly payment and does a
big bundle and sends it out where you get
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of his new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can Illuminati drops from Pac,
H&L, a bunch of a bunch of other guys in
[SPEAKER_00]: the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if you want to go check out Gert
by Seeds, if you're in Australia,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can check out what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Riot Seeds in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Riot Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Goldcut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Goldcut.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to have some some of Pac Go
Farm and high lonesome stuff too soon out
[SPEAKER_03]: in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Gert by Seeds is getting some more of
the Blue and Cross stuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget LFTD Seeds if Matt's maybe
sold out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He carries a lot of other stuff too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, please check him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: LFTD Genetics or LFTD Genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always get it wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he even made another account
because I kept screwing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're interested in any of the
stuff that H&L or Pac and them were
[SPEAKER_00]: working on, man, they got them in the
discord, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always talking about stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, if you want to get in on
that early, that's the place to be,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think even Bitter made some Strawberry
Cough, Blue and Cross stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe it's Blue Bonnet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue and Cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be available in the
discord somehow, someway.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll figure it out.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always forget about Kronzo too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Kronzo's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I think, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: A pick and lick dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always get it wrong, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I don't even know how to,
I barely got on here with you and his
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to, I don't know how to
spell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on Hooked on Phonics, didn't
complete it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be ashamed that your mother had
to come do the connection for you,
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's yelling for me right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pizza rolls.
Fuck.
Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little Genos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last question, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's pick one here real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already answered the goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, Durago or Dino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Codex is all the old strains and
it's like a list of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not even putting my stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just for old clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I haven't worked on it in a while and
I really need to because it was built for
[SPEAKER_03]: that purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's amazing for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the Discord, there's a search
function.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can type in subrob and there's a lot
to talk about it there or mad elite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, subrob isn't that underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also hit him up.
[SPEAKER_03]: ctriprob, ctrip underscore rob,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe it's just ctriprob.
[SPEAKER_03]: On Instagram, hit him up.
[SPEAKER_03]: mad elite.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't hit him up.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a hidden man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a kept man.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, no, he has some of the best chem
work that's ever been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can speak on both of them real
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go ahead, please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing them right now, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for Matt's right, Rob is a great
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not on like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bullshit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have questions, talk to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk to him on both on a pretty
regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll ask anything you need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as skank dog in particular,
that thing is fucking amazing,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was a breeder, I ain't even like
bullshitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was a breeder, one of the expressions
I found out of one pack, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, I'm hitting this to everything,
bro, or hitting stuff to hit whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't describe it because the best way I
can describe it is a raunchy, rancid,
[SPEAKER_00]: used coffee ground smell that it's got
maybe a little skunk to it, a little tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of mint, and it's just kind of like
this sharpness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that's the sour coming through,
the skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been years since I've smoked some of
that kind of shit, so it's hard to really
[SPEAKER_00]: wrap my brain around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all kind of exhibited those
flavors out of the pack of pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structure is where they vary and the
ease of grow, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that I had is super dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen some of the pictures,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beautiful nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me put it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew it under 100 watt light for about,
basically, its whole life until about the
[SPEAKER_00]: last four weeks of its life, and I put it
under a big dog, big light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But great plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even the other ones, after I ran out
of that, I got a little bitty bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm sending some samples off,
or giving some samples away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to crack those open and smoke
the rest of it because I like it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't speak on the SSH or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: The SSSDH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob's been talking about me with that one
a little bit, but I ain't grown that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other one, what was the other
one he was asking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a skank dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the mad elite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mad elite, you're probably not
going to find a lot of conversation on it
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Discord because it was such a
limited drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Prior to that, it was like seven,
eight years, nine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a long time ago when it was all
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: A limited drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there could be very well most people
that bought it weren't even in the Discord
[SPEAKER_00]: for starters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure Discord was a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out UrbsSD and a couple other
people, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Urbs is either finished or run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the resurrection is the Kim one,
the Kim D one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me personally, I got both the
resurrection, the mobile one, and the Kim
[SPEAKER_00]: D going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of the Kim ones, they
dampened off a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my fault, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked around with his chick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big kiddies and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm growing them right now and they're
looking killer, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't smoked those yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to find info on them,
bro, because honestly, there's not a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people that got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Help me up in the Discord.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll answer anything about it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoked a lot of it, grown some of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think we'll get a modeling contract
out of this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking hoping somebody sees my
passion, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got so much passion, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unleash me on these guys, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking coming for everybody,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need y'all's goddamn money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming for everybody this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year or next year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, whatever, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need your fucking cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just support us, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us what we need to take over the
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and Matt and crew, everybody else a
thousandfold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about to change the game,
the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going through another level,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sponsors galore.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be sandals, crocs, dildos,
shirts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever you got.
[SPEAKER_03]: Glassmakers who now make dildos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Spindle, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, shout out Spindle.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, until next time.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully next week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it should be next week.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace, brother.
