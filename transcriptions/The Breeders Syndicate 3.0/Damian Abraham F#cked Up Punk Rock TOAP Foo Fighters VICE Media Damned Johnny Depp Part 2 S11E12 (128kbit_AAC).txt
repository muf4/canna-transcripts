[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_00]: counterculture that is Canna.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_00]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be joined by members of the Canna
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_01]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_01]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is going to be another kind of hot
start.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're cutting into part two of the
interview with Damian Abraham.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you haven't watched part one,
go back, check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably going to smash them together
afterwards and make it one long two-hour
[SPEAKER_01]: interview, as it was meant to be
presented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to make it easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plus, YouTube kind of squashed it with
18 plus because of, I think, his band name
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I hope you guys enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more than just punk rock
stuff in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the more fascinating
interviews I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on the response, I think we're
probably going to do some future episodes
[SPEAKER_01]: together interviewing other people about
Canna and punk rock and try to remarry
[SPEAKER_01]: some of that history that was there during
the late 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: High Times presented a lot of that musical
influence and genre along with our
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of got just washed out down to
Rastafari and Grateful Dead and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a major punk rock aspect to
Canna.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, it's outlaw culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that ties in very close.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I hope you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, watch part one if you haven't seen
it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll roll on in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for taking time to watch it with
us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny when you go on tour with those
huge like any time you go on tour with
[SPEAKER_04]: like a real professional band.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can tell they practice and they
wouldn't know anything about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, same exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't imagine doing that shit like
beforehand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then sometimes you'll see a band or be
on tour with the band.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, oh, should they say the same
thing every night?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you realize, oh, because that way
you're not just up there fumbling for the
[SPEAKER_04]: words and you're not like, oh,
what was I trying to say here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, dissing Taylor Swift or
something when you go off script,
[SPEAKER_04]: like mistakes can happen on stage when you
go off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I guess these bands have these
things and these protocols that they kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of follow at a certain point.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were like, I don't want to say this
band because I'm going to say like I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: mocking, but there's this like hardcore
band that went on tour with a huge band.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for weeks before, maybe a month before
they were in rehearsals before this,
[SPEAKER_04]: because they were like, this is a huge
opportunity for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want to go out there and show the
fucking show the fans that this band,
[SPEAKER_04]: what we got and be our best version of
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think back to when fucked up,
did our tour with Tenacious D and the Foo
[SPEAKER_04]: Fighters.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, oh, that probably would have
served us really well to have that
[SPEAKER_04]: approach versus our approach of just show
up on the plane and try and do the exact
[SPEAKER_04]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the exact same thing we do in a club
to 25 people, to like 40,000 people
[SPEAKER_04]: looking for their seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what's so punk rock about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, really realistically, that's,
that's what appeals to punk rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's also realistically all
I'm capable of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: That too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I think there's sometimes I'll talk
to people or see people in bands and I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: like, why are you doing punk?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you could clearly be doing anything
in this world.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, this is all like, I'm really
capable of speaking of which I was
[SPEAKER_01]: listening to the Mike Kinsella episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was almost heartbroken when,
when you talked about cap jazz and whether
[SPEAKER_01]: it was a punk rock band and I was like,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yes, it's a fucking punk band.
[SPEAKER_01]: It drove me fucking nuts that you didn't
want to claim it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like own it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think cause people have a lot of baggage
around that word.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's put onto them by other
people around them claiming it and being
[SPEAKER_04]: so vocal with what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the version of punk that waves the
flag, the highest is a very defined thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, if you and I both know
that's like probably the smallest,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would argue one of the least interesting
parts of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that like, when it becomes bands like
cap and jazz and the clean and New Zealand
[SPEAKER_04]: and when all this stuff can be part of
punk, that's when it's most exciting to
[SPEAKER_04]: me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always saying, yeah, like it's crazy
when people blow back on that shit too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've had people like push back on,
on the idea that like certain bands were
[SPEAKER_04]: punk, like that's not punk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing a gel by Afro voice because
that's exactly what I'm thinking of when
[SPEAKER_04]: we're talking about those new New Zealand
bands.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, that's not punk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, well, they call themselves
punk.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were listening to punk before that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was their reaction to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how can one version of this thing be
any more valid than someone else's version
[SPEAKER_04]: of this thing?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, that's, it's, but I think that's
why a lot of people internalize it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like turning to punk, if there's
anything we do for people, it's like maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: like a brief moment of punk therapy where
people come on and they're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if this thing was punk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, no, no, here's, here's my
evidence that I've covered about why it is
[SPEAKER_04]: punk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they, they leave and I feel
they're a little more at peace with their,
[SPEAKER_04]: their connection to punk rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly noticed that with Tim
Heidecker.
[SPEAKER_04]: He came on the show and he was so push
backy about punk stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then ever since then, he's talking
about punk all the time now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I feel like we had a breakthrough
therapy moment.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why I expected Mike Goncelo
just to own it like so much like,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause to me, Captain Jazz, like granted,
they're not fucking discharge,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, but the, everything they brought,
even though it was during, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: calling it the emo era isn't really
accurate either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know they get stomped in there,
which kind of separates it a bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just their whole attitude of just
singing off key and fuck everything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's fast and it's aggressive in its
own way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I saw them do a reunion show at,
um, the house of vans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, with Goudge, Goudge away and cap
and jazz were like on fucking believable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember just being like, holy shit,
this is incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like just like, just like could not
believe how sick the show was and how
[SPEAKER_04]: great it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was jealous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and I was never the biggest Joan of
Arc fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm more of a Joan of Arc fan now than I
was at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember going to see him and I wanted
10 yard fight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was definitely right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were offering, uh, but cap and jazz.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, this, this is, and I liked the
records before, but like, live,
[SPEAKER_04]: it just really blew me away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I think it's punk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, that's the only way I want
punk is when it's all those bands.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's, it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like my, my motto on the show is that like
everybody's somebody's poser.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's every, cause every single person
that comes on the show, they'll not be
[SPEAKER_04]: another person without exception.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can think of that'll be like,
yeah, fuck that dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, like, uh, like it just,
it never, it never fails.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can think of that like all the time
where there's like people that are so
[SPEAKER_04]: adamant that like, this is punk.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my version of punk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my version of punk is the true version
of punk and just other people that just
[SPEAKER_04]: clown on those people for, for trying to
be that person.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just, it's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's interesting how, you know,
it's like that star Wars thing,
[SPEAKER_04]: the more you tighten your fist,
the more it slips through your fingers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the harder you try to claim
punk, the cornier it looks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I say this as a person with a podcast
called turn into punks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just as corny as the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give me, give me your best,
um, cannabis touring weirdest story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one you can actually tell on the
pod.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't get mad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, w w making the wrestlers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, and I, I'm sure this guy would be
totally fine with me saying his name as a
[SPEAKER_04]: wrestler.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I won't say the wrestler's name.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I went to a guy's wrestling school that
was in Atlanta, Georgia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's probably why I'm not saying,
cause I don't think it went to medical at
[SPEAKER_04]: this point even.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I, I, we go to, like, I don't know
my way around Atlanta, but I've been told
[SPEAKER_04]: from people that this is not a great part
of Atlanta subsequently.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a huge strip club and we go
into the back and there's a wrestling
[SPEAKER_04]: school in the back of the strip club.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the coolest, most inclusive,
awesome wrestling school I've ever been
[SPEAKER_04]: to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I was just so great and all the
kids are awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just reeks of weed the whole time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, fuck, I gotta get weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's gonna like, but it's all like
younger kids there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to ask these kids and the
wrestlers we were rolling with were
[SPEAKER_04]: straight edge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so I'm like, well, I don't want to ask
these guys.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I noticed the guy who's running
the wrestling school is smoking like
[SPEAKER_04]: zigzag brand blunts.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like with tobacco and I'm not even
with, with weed in them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, Oh, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so later on we're at the end of the
shoot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, man, it really smells like a
weed in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, Oh, that's from the strip club
next door.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, Oh, so could I go in there
and buy weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, he's like, well, I could
probably go in there and buy weed,
[SPEAKER_04]: but if you went there, they'd eat you
alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, would you want weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, well, I, I, you know,
I smoke weed all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason I'm smoking these is because
I'm on probation right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but, uh, I can get you weed if you
want to get weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't want to put you in a weird
spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on probation.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, nah, I gotta get other drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good thing I didn't name the guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we go down the street to this gas
station and we pull them the gas station
[SPEAKER_04]: and he's like, uh, what do you want?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just give me like here's 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he's like, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then he comes out and we're
looking around the gas station,
[SPEAKER_04]: me and all the camera crew and we've got
all the camera gear in the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like, this is a weird gas
station.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I could have bought anything at
that gas station.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could have bought a rocket launcher.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a bunch of dudes milling around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he comes out and he's like here
and just tossing me a bunch of like
[SPEAKER_04]: literal nickel bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't see the nickel bag before.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, the guy will give you
another like however many for like 20
[SPEAKER_04]: bucks more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone in the cruise like,
yeah, I get more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we get more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got all these nickel bags and I go
back to the hotel room and I smoked it and
[SPEAKER_04]: it was like, I don't know if it was laced.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what was up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hadn't smoked in a few days,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm sitting in the bathtub and I'm
like, this is the most stone I think I've
[SPEAKER_04]: ever been of this random nickel bag from
the gas station.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think of, I mean,
did you, did you have clothes on still for
[SPEAKER_01]: you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in the clothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're fiddling with yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fully dressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was able to contemplate the fact that
it might be laced.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it probably wasn't laced if I put it
together like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another time we were, we went to Russia
and we've been to Russia before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first time we went to Russia,
we're like, oh, this is crazy here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do whatever the fuck you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause the kids we were with, they're like,
we took, we went to St. Petersburg.
[SPEAKER_04]: We played a show in St. Petersburg.
[SPEAKER_04]: We like hung out with a bunch of kids and
they're like, Oh, we're doing your show in
[SPEAKER_04]: Moscow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take the train back with us to Moscow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the kid who brought us there was with
us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like smoking hash in the train
in between train cars, like on a hash
[SPEAKER_04]: pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're like, there's no fucking laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're like stone the whole time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Having a great time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went back to Moscow and we,
this time we were playing a show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, vice and Adidas had been doing his
show and you got to the show and,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, they were like, before we went on
stage, the people from, uh, Russian Adidas
[SPEAKER_04]: were like, you guys can't go on stage
unless you're all wearing Adidas clothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone in the band's like,
no, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone in the band refuses, but I'm
like, fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're like, okay, here's what we have
in your side.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a pair of Adidas Lamborghini
loafers, a pair of super short athletic
[SPEAKER_04]: short shorts and a panel cap and some
triple XL lime green t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went on stage, we played that show
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went back to our, our, our like,
uh, apartment they had rented for the
[SPEAKER_04]: night.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our friend showed up who had weed and
we're smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And earlier the guy from vice had shown up
in his apartment and he's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've brought you weed because you say you
want a weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes out and he breaks out like,
and excuse me that I don't actually know
[SPEAKER_04]: the science of, but you know, when you
break a nug and there's like the little,
[SPEAKER_04]: little sub nugs, yeah, little brax,
brax.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he gives me three brax in my hand and
I'm like, Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like to share with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't smoke it all at once,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then our friend showed up and he had
tons of weeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're like smoking weed in the
apartment.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are like drinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's not crazy by any other
band standards, but by fucked up standard,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is probably the wildest part that
we've ever had in, in, in after a show.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was very tame at a certain point.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're like, you guys should go back to
the, uh, like go home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we've got to go to the airport soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's like, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, Oh, we can't leave.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, look through the people and
you look through the people on the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: corridor of this apartment floor is just
full of cops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there must be like 20 cops down the
hallway and a gauntlet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like, Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we do?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, we're just not going to
let them in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like, what, what, what they
might leave and we're like, what if they
[SPEAKER_04]: don't?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, Oh, big trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: The weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like, Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: So eventually there's like this
negotiation process that goes on where
[SPEAKER_04]: they agree to allow every Russian person
to leave, except for the staff from vice
[SPEAKER_04]: Russia and us who have to stay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we get the weed out, which is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then the cops swarm in and immediately
arrest all the people from vice Russia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like, Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Real serious.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just us and these Russian cops
are like, you can go to sleep now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we all go to everyone in the band,
pretty much drunk, except for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just passes out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just like me sitting there
listening to this cops radio going off all
[SPEAKER_04]: night until eventually, I guess I,
I doze off, wake up the drivers there and
[SPEAKER_04]: they're like, we're taking to the airport
and they took us to the airport and I've
[SPEAKER_04]: never been back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've never heard from any of the
vice people ever again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, we, we played a show years later
and one of the people that worked there,
[SPEAKER_04]: she came to the show and she kind of let
us know that like, yeah, we were in jail
[SPEAKER_04]: overnight and they let us all go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to Gulag.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, yeah, not, not chill.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other time we were smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean I got all these weed stories
and no one wants to hear ever,
[SPEAKER_04]: but uh, we're, we're in, um, Lawrence,
Kansas, maybe Lawrence, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm, my friend's there and he's
straight edge and I'm like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: Juno has got weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, yeah, my, my, my friends
smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll take you there and you can get
some weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we roll over to their house and they've
got a blunt and they're passing it around
[SPEAKER_04]: and I take a hit and it's super harsh.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, I'm not really a blunt
smoker to begin with.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this was harsh.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the guy's like, yeah, yeah,
it's money.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's money.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, okay, cool money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we finish it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, we're going to roll up
another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they start rolling up another one and
they bring out like a little bag of
[SPEAKER_04]: shredded up bills that you get from like,
I guess the mint of like T commission
[SPEAKER_04]: money and they sprinkle it on top of the
blunt and then they roll it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, it's literal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they think he was going to get them
higher?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually, I wanted to ask you about
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, uh, we heard Australia one time and I
was at a hedge.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were, this is when we're on that crazy
food fighters tour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went into this head shop and,
uh, talking to the person buying some
[SPEAKER_04]: blunt wraps.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I said, I don't smoke blunt so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm, I'm buying some blunt wraps in
this head shop in Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the person's like, Oh, where are you
from?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm, you know, get talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, Oh, we're here playing with the
food fighters.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, Oh, here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I've never felt more like a rock
star than I did on that food fighters
[SPEAKER_04]: tour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I can just like walk around and be
like, you want guest list?
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like next door tour manager.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, so I'm like, Oh, you want to guess
this?
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, yeah, yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, how many friends?
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like three friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, no fucking problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like text the guy like, yeah, this is this
random person I just met.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take this bag of herbs and smoke it with
your weed and it'll get you way more
[SPEAKER_04]: stone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you think California's got mids,
Australia had some mids and they got some
[SPEAKER_01]: bush weed out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we started smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was lion's mane in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it was a lion's mane or something
like that though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't mentioned lion's mane because
there was no mushrooms in it, but it was
[SPEAKER_04]: like all herbs and we smoked it and it got
a super stone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know what it was that week.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably like that wizard weed
shit from high times, like Daga.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, but it wasn't like fake.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't like K2 or any of that kind of
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was definitely like all natural,
all natural herbs, herbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were on that tour and one night we got,
we got like Jack Black was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's, can I smoke a blunt?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause nation's D's on the tour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he's like, can I smoke a blunt with
you guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we gave him the blunt and he's smoking
and this was all that herb stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, so stone.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just like passed out in the back room
for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know what it was,
but we were getting, we were getting way
[SPEAKER_03]: higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I entered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interviewing Wally Duck, one of the
old famous Australian breeders tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to ask him, what's that shit
you guys got over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: It ain't weed, but it helped the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was another thing we used to have in
Toronto in the, in the dirty nineties
[SPEAKER_04]: called poppers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like not, you know, the poppers you sniff,
but you get a popper bong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you heard of this thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know what poppers are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is in a way a more intense and it's
like a, it's like a giant circular glass
[SPEAKER_04]: bong.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's like a metal piece in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that goes in the top and you stuff it
with tobacco and weed and then you suck
[SPEAKER_04]: and it pops.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes like an audible pop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was like a popper.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like back in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we had after Rosie's hash dried up,
we had mids, mids, mids, mids in Ontario
[SPEAKER_04]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was the way people would
mainly smoke their weed back then,
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, to get rid of the weed tasters.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder what device it like at first,
I thought you were describing a gravity
[SPEAKER_01]: bong, but it doesn't sound like that at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, it's like a circle.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only time I've ever seen one since
was actually in Australia in Melbourne.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy was like, Oh, this is how we smoke
weed here.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I went to some someone's house there
one time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like, how weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen this since the dirty days
in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always like that hope that you
like show up and it happens occasionally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you show up into town and I try and
put a word in advance that I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like to friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yo, if you have a friend who
like really smokes weed, like you're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: my friend is a stoner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please put me in touch before I get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I definitely want to meet this
person and smoke with them and would love
[SPEAKER_04]: to get their connect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that's all I want to do before we
play a show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, just smoke weed and chill and
talk to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I like when we go places that have
lounges or vapor bars and occasionally you
[SPEAKER_04]: luck out and you meet someone who's super
chill or has great weed or, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so there's been, there've been some great
experiences that have come through
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis and touring some dark times too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some really depressing dark times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when someone shows up and they give
you the weed and you are like,
[SPEAKER_04]: fuck, I got to smoke it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm obligated to smoke this person,
but you're like looking at you're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to be a snob, but there's
this, this is really going to be harsh.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is definitely something ain't right.
[SPEAKER_04]: This doesn't look like it's supposed to
look.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but also it gives me a great sense of
privilege when I come home.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's probably why I smoke
out of literally any rig.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't give a fuck what the banger
looks like and all this sort of stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I've been in places where I've
been smoking twigs off the top of a Coke
[SPEAKER_04]: can.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is Coke cans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make everything accessible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's jungle boys compared to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the, one of the people in,
in our discord asks, you had a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: based podcast that's no longer available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any insight into where it went?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish it would still around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, my, um, the host Buddha blaze,
who a good friend of mine, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: we kind of just, lost touch and then he
took down the episodes and yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: I really enjoyed doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I learned a lot from Buddha, Buddha and,
uh, Buddha was obviously on his cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: journey long before I was, but I think we
both kind of met a lot of the same people
[SPEAKER_04]: around the same time and really good
friends and did this podcast for years
[SPEAKER_04]: together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that legalization session I was
talking about where like, I think we've
[SPEAKER_04]: just seen the end of an era was us
recording that podcast together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, like hopefully one day it comes
back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I, I haven't talked to Buddha in a
long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have deep love for him and stuff,
but hopefully archived it somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hopefully you did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's, it's weird how digital stuff
works like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I kind of looked at digital stuff as
just being like, Oh, it's there forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just on the internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't erase it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now realizing how much stuff has just
disappeared.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a black hole for it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's, there's interesting periods
where like the eighties and the nineties
[SPEAKER_04]: are super well documented in terms of
videos and, and audio recordings and all
[SPEAKER_04]: these sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I find like the early two thousands
because digital cameras weren't so hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: People weren't really uploading them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those, a lot of those geo city sites are
now gone and like CDRs don't last forever
[SPEAKER_04]: and all this sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it feels like that's like a black hole
culturally, uh, in terms of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you go on YouTube and look for bands
from that era, I'm always shocked at how
[SPEAKER_04]: little there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really hard to find some shit from
that era.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I guess vinyl in the nineties
just was not, not the format of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give me your, it's hard to do this
because like as a, as a punk rock
[SPEAKER_01]: historian that you are, give me the top
five off the top of your head,
[SPEAKER_01]: best LPs that people should listen to LPs.
[SPEAKER_04]: That actually probably is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is easier because I think it's harder to
pull off a punk LP.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like thousands of bands that have
incredible seven inches, but LPs it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a much smaller list.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I've thought my head so punk and
hardcore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 or five, five, five.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, feel the darkness by poison idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: A perfect record, uh, bastard wind of
pain, a Japanese band.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like motorhead covering
discharge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's kind of rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's just, it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got two spots left.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wait, no, I got three spots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then I can say incorrect thoughts by
the two sub humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I think I actually weirdly liked
the CD presents version more because it
[SPEAKER_04]: has the song behind the smile on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They changed the track listing on the CD
presents one and the mix is weirder,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I love that song so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think behind the smile might be one of
my favorite songs ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally underrated band too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Canadian sub humans are, I used to
argue forever that they were the better of
[SPEAKER_04]: the two sub humans, but now having seen
both sub humans live, the UK sub humans
[SPEAKER_01]: are still good too to this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dick is one of the greatest front people
of all time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, so I got love for both sub
humans.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm like going around the world,
trying to think of a mush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so your boots are mush.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think I'm going to say mush by
letter face.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then for the final slot,
uh, by the first teenage head LP.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I think these ones are like,
yeah, like I think these are records that
[SPEAKER_04]: are like, I think nevermind the bollocks
of things, like a perfect punk record.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the saints record could easily be
on there too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there's like records that are just,
you know, canonically like, like the dam
[SPEAKER_04]: actually all the, all the dams.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole way through could go all the way
to strawberries.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of like it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I was the only person that did
to me that song, uh, ignite sounds like
[SPEAKER_04]: what AFI would kind of be doing later on
sonically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've wanted to ask Davey about that
record because like it, it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I did, I do lights for them when they
did that record grave mistake in the 90s
[SPEAKER_04]: on nitro late 90s, early 2000s,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had to do lights at a show.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had never done lights and I walked
backstage to meet them as they were
[SPEAKER_04]: saying, that was the worst light show
you've ever had to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never done lights in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, they, uh, but, but they were,
I think I reckon it's good too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That song about the internet's not so
great, but like that talk to me,
[SPEAKER_04]: his voice never got bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that tour we did with them was
incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there was like, it was just,
everyone in the band's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the crew is all like dudes that have
been like, uh, the tour manager had been
[SPEAKER_04]: in a mother records band and everyone else
in the crew had been in like UK punk bands
[SPEAKER_04]: and hardcore bands.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like everyone's chill.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the captain and Dave were definitely
the two hardest nuts to crack keyboardist
[SPEAKER_04]: to the keyboardist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I ever cracked that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to take captain sensible that
wrap 45 watt and have him sign that he
[SPEAKER_04]: would love to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're like, one day we're in the
stone pony in New Jersey and I'm sitting
[SPEAKER_04]: outside and the way I smoke weed on the
road is like, you know, the apple pipe
[SPEAKER_04]: that makes, then I take a water bottle and
wedge it into the, where you breathe in
[SPEAKER_04]: the intake hole and cut a hole in the
bottom of the water bottle and just kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of create a chamber.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The smoke's kind of fill.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like smoking weed or this crazy
water bottle, apple contraption.
[SPEAKER_04]: The captain comes out, he's like,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I'm smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want something?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, I'm here to smoke my
cigars.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he puts down a cigar and he's got like
a little Tupperware container with like a
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch of backwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, you'll smoke weed in those.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, no, no, these are my cigars.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, he's like, do you want one?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, I've never smoked a
backwards cigar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I take one and it is, oh my God,
is it harsh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, so I'm like, oh, so what was it like
when you managed crass?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I met, I went to the 100 club and
kicked open the door and said,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I ended up actually managing them for
a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I, I booked their shows and I would
get the money for them and all this sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, he was, he was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he was super awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave, like he would say hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I walk by him in the hallways,
you know, and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the last session's a fucking cool
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And his voice never got bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets better, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he gets more control over that thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's incredible to watch him every night
go out there and just like, they were
[SPEAKER_04]: fantastic every night.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the last night of tour,
our dressing room is right by the stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're all in our dressing room after
the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the baby shakes who are our friends
were on that tour too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're all kind of like hanging out
together and I'm like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I go to the set the stage and grab a
set list, rip the set list off the stage
[SPEAKER_04]: and come back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, I'm getting them all to sign
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I go up to Dave and I'm like,
Dave, do you mind signing this?
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes, well, I'm mine, but I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as he's signing, he turns to me and he
goes, you know, I'll never forget this
[SPEAKER_04]: tour.
[SPEAKER_04]: You scared me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You scared Dave Vanian.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, that's all I could hope for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're playing the, uh, I think we were at,
was it the fucking, I can't believe I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: blanking on the club.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're at like one of the main sort of like
legendary clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: In New York, playing with the damned on
Halloween.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, uh, if it wasn't missing my kids
so bad and missing Halloween with the
[SPEAKER_04]: kids, I would have, uh, it was definitely
like a career life highlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next time I'm making you get on face
FaceTime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can meet these people by you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's the, it never is lost on me as
like a fan of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: How wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: These things are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I feel like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's why I had to start the
podcast because there's just like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, there's just so many questions I
had for captain sensible and you just,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can't, you can't punish people like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it can't be like, Hey, here's an hour
worth of questions for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that was really why I created the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Joan and I would like, we were on this
tour sound wave in Australia, huge
[SPEAKER_04]: festival tour, traveling to Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were on the tour and monster magnet was
on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we went over and we're like
knocking the door and Dave from monster
[SPEAKER_04]: magnet opens their dressing room door and
he's like, Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're like, Hey, we're in fucked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we just want to tell you that shrapnel
fucking rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, yeah, shrapnel is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Combat law.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you guys are awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just have them like sit down and
talk to us for like 20 minutes about New
[SPEAKER_04]: Jersey punk and hardcore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's why I met Duff McKagan for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, yeah, knocked on his door and
he's like, looks at me like, what's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, Hey man, don't want to
bother you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farts fucking kill.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farts, fast backs, like all that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Silly killers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they, all that stuff is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's just like, come in, come here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, that's when I realized that
this podcast, there's something to it
[SPEAKER_04]: because like, no matter how famous someone
gets it, they were really, really into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like really into the shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It scars you for life, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it just never leaves you completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, and I've noticed this from
doing the show, like everyone loves
[SPEAKER_04]: getting a chance to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and like once they get over there,
if they have any baggage attached to the
[SPEAKER_04]: word, I mean, but like for the most part,
I find like bringing people back that
[SPEAKER_04]: moment and getting to talk to them about
these random seven inch only bands that
[SPEAKER_04]: meant the world to them as kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I, I, I weirdly, uh, yeah,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think every single one, barring a few,
I like walk away from like, Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been a couple, imagine been a
couple that haven't aired and a couple
[SPEAKER_04]: that have aired where I'm still like,
eh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all part of it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone through that too with the weed
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'd look back like, have you ever
been worked?
[SPEAKER_04]: Has there ever been someone you met and
you're like, Oh, this guy is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cannabis world's interesting because
it's, it's such a, like, I guess like punk
[SPEAKER_04]: is like, it's so different because punk,
there's like, like, um, like a moral side
[SPEAKER_04]: to it or like a, a, uh, a certain like
group thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that obviously people think
differently and everyone's got different
[SPEAKER_04]: opinions within it, but we're all
orientated more or less in the same
[SPEAKER_04]: direction where cannabis and wrestling
just attract people from all different
[SPEAKER_04]: walks of life and all kinds of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, uh, as long as the topic stays
on that one thing you have in common,
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone gets along.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to see how people take
to this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I always want to do, uh, punk stuff
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, even, even like post posting that,
that we're going to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a really good response.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like a few more too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I, I feel like that same with the
turn in a punk episode that you're on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was like, how's this going to be
received?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: And people loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing but positive people like feedback
being like, as long as they don't know me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew once Spencer also hit me out and
was like, Hey, you know, my buddy,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's, that's all like,
that's the thing about punk and hardcore
[SPEAKER_04]: that I love.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, uh, it didn't really have this sort
of ability in, in wrestling or,
[SPEAKER_04]: or cannabis in that way that you can
always check someone's resume.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all like from scenes and every
scenes like really connect to each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, like it's, it is,
uh, all you needed, like, and I find that
[SPEAKER_04]: traveling around too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you're like, Hey, there's this
like dude in this town or this person in
[SPEAKER_04]: this town, you should meet up with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, punk's always sort of this like
network of, of those sorts of friendships.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bunch of lost boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just, and it's something that,
you know, like I was talking to Ben Giver
[SPEAKER_04]: from death cab for cutie and, um,
David Bazan from Pedro the lion today.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like, talking about Ian McKay
and how important he is to both of their
[SPEAKER_04]: lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just like, yeah, it just never
leaves you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just, there's just so many of us
that have like wound up in different
[SPEAKER_04]: places that came out of this, I guess,
many different cults, but like this,
[SPEAKER_04]: like cult of punk rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of different places.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the cannabis side of it too,
it's, I feel like, yeah, there's a,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a lot of punks out there that
smoke the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Connoisseur of your connoisseur from San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like a, uh, uh, power violence
weed band.
[SPEAKER_01]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have that now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this now?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're, they're very, very pro cannabis
and all their songs are about smoking weed
[SPEAKER_04]: and the plant and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is, yeah, there's a lot of us,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I feel, I don't know, I feel like not
everyone has crime posters hanging in
[SPEAKER_04]: their office, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, there's a lot of punk rock
crossover there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I know I told you about the jail
by after stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, like, you know, Mark Emory,
Candice Prince of pot, the guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: the dark enemy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dark enemy who, who not a great dude,
but certainly for cannabis did,
[SPEAKER_04]: did a lot in terms of his name's always
going to be linked, linked to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not a weed guy at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just like a libertarian dude in,
in, uh, London, Ontario ran this bookstore
[SPEAKER_04]: called city lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bookstore was just filling people's
parking meters, um, opening on Sundays
[SPEAKER_04]: when you weren't allowed to open on
Sundays in, in Ontario, uh, selling the
[SPEAKER_04]: NWA record when you weren't allowed to
sell the NWA record in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he got really into Jell-O and the
dead Candice because of the PMRC trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on that third, uh, spoken word record,
Jell's got that track.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's got to grow pot or one should
smoke more pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The name of the song is right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he mentions Jack hair and the emperor
has no clothes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, Mark tried to order that book in
for the store and it was a banned book in
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was distributors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we can't actually send you that book.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's illegal in Canada and high times was
illegal back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ong's were illegal in Canada back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was very draconian cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he starts smuggling in the emperor
has no clothes and, and, and high times
[SPEAKER_04]: and they sold that really quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he's like, Oh my God, there's a
market for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I started bringing in more of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it started bringing in various
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Jack hair, I forget who he brought
in, but a bunch of people in to do
[SPEAKER_04]: lectures, brought Jell-O by Afrin actually
to do a spoken word event.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder how well they would have gotten
along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jell-O did not like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked Jell-O about it quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, Hey, we did not really get
along too well.
[SPEAKER_01]: His voice so well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jell-O and I went on a cruise together.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've, we've traveled some places.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd be fun to hang out with for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is definitely incredible to hang out
with, but it is, um, it's real.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's the thing about Jell-O.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a character jealous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and so Mark brought them up there
and, and yeah, just kind of get more and
[SPEAKER_04]: more into cannabis through a, but it's
through Jell-O by Afrin and then
[SPEAKER_04]: eventually shows up in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all that stuff in Vancouver with the
Vancouver sea bank and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's so wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all came through Jell-O.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then actually weirdly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when he gets busted, he had,
they busted two accomplices with a
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana man and, um, Michelle Ramey and
Michelle Ramey got diagnosed with cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, when she got diagnosed,
they crossed the infamous bull rider.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: An Afghan and maybe the Afghani bull
rider.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was her strain before she passed
away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that's the strain that Drake raps
about in all his songs, because there was
[SPEAKER_04]: a guy in Toronto that was getting it from
out West.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the guy that was selling to
Drake and 40 back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why Drake and 40 have deep ties
to the Afghani bull rider, but they just
[SPEAKER_04]: call it, I guess, bull rider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just stole the bull rider name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just said, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some little clown from the U S
working with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of leeched onto it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pre Kendrick Lamar situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That probably had a lot of fame.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kendrick Lamar kind of turned that on his
fucking head, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be like a, they not like
us train.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have, you should be, it's just reading
the bull rider strain that that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, bull riders kind of lost to the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a strain from Fresno that made it
down to San Diego and got really big.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I was originally a black bull
rider.
[SPEAKER_01]: A black dude that was a bull rider.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, you know, give a dude, a few clones,
the, the sister clone still alive though,
[SPEAKER_01]: called old Betsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the, uh, the actual sister of
bull rider, but bull rider itself is for
[SPEAKER_01]: all intents and purposes, uh, lost to the
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as I know, but Afghani bull rider
was something that was like a white whale
[SPEAKER_04]: strain when I first heard this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was, it was available in seeds
online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as far as like, if you were in the
forums, you could get Afghani bull rider,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it wasn't like something most people
were tapped into or even knew about or
cared about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it showed up in Toronto at one
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one that Drake would send is the black
Uber black to pick up the weed from,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, and it was $20 a gram versus $10 a
gram for pretty much everything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it, I guess has a sister strain,
uh, God's vagina.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that was lovely.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was slightly cheaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was more of the God's vagina,
uh, uh, level of, uh, affordability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that more your flavor?
[SPEAKER_01]: God's vagina?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I, I, I like, that's my thing with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: The best cannabis is the one you got in
your hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I obviously like my, I think the,
I one time smoked, um, uh, a Siemens haze
[SPEAKER_04]: that we've talked about this before that
tasted insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that dirty banana, uh, I tried
recently was really crazy in Spain,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, tried like a lot of strain,
but like, also at the same time,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know, if I'm in a pinch,
as I said, I'll smoke sticks off a tin
[SPEAKER_04]: can.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really, yeah, like the best week is
the one I can afford that's in my hand at
[SPEAKER_04]: that given time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then now I, I'm mainly at home,
like I'll smoke cannabis, but,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, in terms of like consuming,
uh, it's dabs just cause I find the
[SPEAKER_04]: efficiency of it and, and a lot less
carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you don't end up junkie dabbing
like me and fucking go near death.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's really important that
you're talking about that because I think
[SPEAKER_04]: it's important that people know that there
are high limits, but there are limits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That maybe you should, uh, I had what
years ago, there was like these,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, vapor bars in Toronto where you could
bring weed and you could buy junk food and
[SPEAKER_04]: you paid a cover to go in, but you
couldn't buy weed there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you could probably buy,
but, uh, on the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember talking to a guy there and
he's like, you know what I do every time
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm about to hit the long again,
I'm like, no, he's like, I put it down and
[SPEAKER_04]: think about maybe I shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think maybe ever since you told me
about what you're dealing with,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yeah, that's what I look at the
rig.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like now I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe let's take a break before this next
dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you don't want to be at a position
where like that's no longer available to
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden there's nothing,
but yeah, nothing to control anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much longer do you have now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think I'm seven months in,
I don't fucking know, but like I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: already, I was supposed to go to the 11
months, but I'm just like, like each day
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wearing down more and more and more
and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably not much longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to try?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, are you going to go right back?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to try like edibles first?
[SPEAKER_04]: You think?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just going to go for flour and
just try to smoke minimal just so I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: push anything too crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not a minimalist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an extremist at everything I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just know me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to dab ever again,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot dab ever again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I, I know cause then I'll be doing it
every 10 minutes again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the thing with dabs too,
is that it becomes, uh, because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: have that harshness to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just becomes real easy to kind of keep
it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with these devices, dude, like when
you're not even having to use a torch and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just so easy to push the button
three times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already pop, you know, but it's
weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why does it not ever hit the same?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's way different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it because maybe it's like not the
immediate heat blast and it's just sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: more consistent heat flow to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't tell you, but yeah,
it doesn't ever hit the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never hits the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also wonder if that's maybe just the
oxygen being cut off and that it could be
[SPEAKER_04]: a rush.
[SPEAKER_04]: It very well could be with like a bong rip
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, the, I feel like dabbing is like
a dying art form in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I, I know people are getting more
sick over time and finally figuring that
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess we'll see where the future of
that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think as long as people got flat
brims, there's going to be people that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I should show you my, do you want me to
show you my crazy rig?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the, this is my crazy rig.
[SPEAKER_04]: So wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who blew this?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is red beer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the story on this piece is,
uh, vice years ago when I was kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: beginning to work on the wrestling TV show
and kind of giving up on the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: feed, they were still making cannabis
content and they decided to do a piece
[SPEAKER_04]: about Tokyo smoke, which is now a
dispensary here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when they originally opened,
which is definitely just a play to kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: get market exposure, I think they opened a
cafe like head shop and they were,
[SPEAKER_04]: their pitch was we're finally making good
looking smoking devices and we're not
[SPEAKER_04]: going to make those shitty glass bongs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have great pieces that are
going to be made out of ceramic.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're going to be incredible for
smoking in and we're going to have,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, down stems that don't actually go into
the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like all sorts of shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like those are clearly not designed by
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I say ceramic too, they were not
finished inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was like this porous surface.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would just be, disgusting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never clean it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never get it clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, you couldn't see through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was just a mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, they did a piece on this place
and in the piece, the guy, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: the designer is like, yeah, we're not,
we're making these pieces that look like
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not like those crappy dragon bongs
that you used to have.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when this piece aired, vice began
getting vice Canada was getting memed to
[SPEAKER_04]: death, uh, on, I guess, various places as
people were like, you know, dragon bongs,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, like people just for fucking going
after them, the glass community,
[SPEAKER_04]: the cannabis community, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're like, what do we do?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we do?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, well, you got to hit up red
beer and do a piece on red beer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause red beer kind of like is the,
there's a lot of great glassblowers in
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada, but red beer was sort of like,
like a real heart of the sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: community, certainly out West.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and he did the glass gathering where
everyone would come and all the
[SPEAKER_04]: glassblowers from across Canada would come
and blow glass all week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, so they go out and shoot with red
beard and do this whole thing on the glass
[SPEAKER_04]: gathering and do this whole piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they come back, the piece airs
and then red beard posts on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, Hey, here's this piece I made
in a tribute to the dragon bong that the
[SPEAKER_04]: vice camera guy smashed when making the
piece about me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they hadn't told me that when they
went out there, red beer was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: actually we're coincidentally the first
piece I made was actually a dragon and put
[SPEAKER_04]: the dragon buying on the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the vice camera guy was doing closeups
and knocked the ball off the table
[SPEAKER_04]: gathering it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So red beer did this and then vice bought
the piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was subsequently given to me
at the end of the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, you guys got to buy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no, there's no way around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's looking awesome though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice right on his camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's why I don't smoke out of
this piece because I would smash it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Dragon Ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, never do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, ever do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of pieces like that,
like a clockwork orange piece that was
[SPEAKER_01]: custom made that I've never done like
touched with anything because it's just so
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was in Toronto and treat yourself
one year they had all these Japanese glass
[SPEAKER_04]: artists come in and they made I think it
was $100,000 at the time pieces.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all worked on it together the whole
weekend and made this like functional
[SPEAKER_04]: glass and I guess a lot of these artists
had never done functional glass because
[SPEAKER_04]: there wasn't really Yeah, a place to do it
for them in Japan at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it was like this crazy piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, there's the same treat
yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a glass leather face dab rig that
you could wear as a mask but it was like
[SPEAKER_04]: God but it was not his glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like $20,000 17,000 like trap
trophies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder where that market Well,
obviously, I know where that market's
[SPEAKER_04]: gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's it's tanked so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, because there's not all this
expendable money, you know, from seed
[SPEAKER_01]: dudes and flower dudes like just buying up
glass just because, you know, you could
[SPEAKER_01]: always move it in the IRS isn't gonna come
take your piece, you know, so yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it's a definitely a dying art form
and and the markets tank quite hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I feel like looking at younger
people now like the pens are amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: consumption thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so weird, too, because well,
I guess that's where the education comes
[SPEAKER_04]: in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just like, people will be like,
I don't know, I'm getting headaches from
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're like, try their pen.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, Yeah, I can tell you why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Name any number of reasons why there's not
meant to be smoked together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so I'm gonna wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're almost at two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I told you I ranable.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, dude, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people are probably gonna want
more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're looking for it, let's do
more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you and me like, we're starting this
and anyone who wants to join, we're gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: start the the pot punk revolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should it needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it does feel like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, you go to the punk rock
museum, you can see Joe Strummer's last
[SPEAKER_04]: stash.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he gave it to the guy from the
Pogues just before he went in the hospital
[SPEAKER_04]: and then passed away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have that preserved on display.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I still haven't gone there yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some like, real, real interesting
stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like, that's the thing about punk,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's definition.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so personal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of stuff that I would
like to see in a punk museum that I'm sure
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't necessarily reflect the opinions
of the people that run it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even then, there's like five or six or
however many people on that committee.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: People running it ultimately headed by Fat
Mike that are probably all pulling in
[SPEAKER_04]: different directions, too, with the
history of this thing, because it is it is
[SPEAKER_04]: vast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, it's worth going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should go there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll smoke when you get we'll have a
Vegas vacation when you get next tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you get back on the on the plan,
you know, happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give it in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, I don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch me rush it and then ruin.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got up to this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm over sobriety, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been over it for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about our psychedelics?
[SPEAKER_04]: Were they ever something for you or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, because I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for my depression shit, like it just
triggers it hardcore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like that's my friends are like,
yeah, you just drop some acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I don't want to fucking lose my
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have nothing for anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the whole fucking point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever tried DMT?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because I was always scared of
shitting myself like physically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be smoking and then all of
a sudden shit myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know why that's like a thing
in my head that DMT will make me piss and
[SPEAKER_01]: or shit myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was good does right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's people are like, oh,
you can throw up a lot and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw up and shit and like all that kind
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, no, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a real disassociation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: DMT, though, was weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, fuck, I could.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I tell you my DMT story?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we were like we went to Australia on
one of these tours, festival tour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Supposed to be staying in in Melbourne.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got like a weed hook up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then last minute, they're like,
no, you guys are going to stay in Brisbane
[SPEAKER_04]: and wait for the tour to catch up to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like, oh, man, I'm like,
I don't know anyone there to get weed,
[SPEAKER_04]: even though it's pretty close to Nimbin.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, you know, still hours away from
Nimbin, two hours away from Nimbin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like, what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the guy picks from the airport and he's
very much like like a fashion-y,
[SPEAKER_04]: emo-y type kid, like more modern,
emo-y type parkour kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like doesn't look like a stoner is what
I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I end up sitting beside him in the
in the van back to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, yeah, man, you know,
he's got weed here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, mate, my buddy's going to hook
you up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so later on, him and his friend came
to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_04]: His friend, one of the coolest looking
drug dealers I've ever seen, looks like a
[SPEAKER_04]: young Matthew McConaughey tossing me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very like some crazy parkour shirt
and in like Colombian band.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jonah's like, is that blah,
blah, blah from Bogota?
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy's like, I don't know, mate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone just gave me the shirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who wants the weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He tosses me like a half ounce.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much do I owe you?
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes, take it for free.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we mainly use weed to smoke DMT
off of here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mike from our band's like,
do you have any DMT?
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy's like, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we go to the hotel room.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all smoke DMT.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't read any of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know anything about DMT.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't know about the crossing over
and I didn't know about the waiting room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I smoke it off the, that apple bong
thing that I make the water pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all in the hotel room together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the weird psychedelic because I
didn't, you don't experience any loss of
[SPEAKER_04]: ego.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the whole time I'm like, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in a room full of people watching me,
but this totally chill because this is a
[SPEAKER_04]: drug and it'll be over in a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: So might as well enjoy this ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm in a room and there's a bunch of,
to me, they look like count clowns from
[SPEAKER_04]: the Windsor McKay cartoons from way back
when.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've now come to learn that these are
the elves that you'll see in a workshop,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're working on a giant machine
that looks like out of Fritz Lang's
[SPEAKER_04]: Metropolis, like that machine thing
they're working on, but it's printing out
[SPEAKER_04]: a very distinct black and white geometric
pattern.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then one of them tears off this
geometric pattern sheet that it prints and
[SPEAKER_04]: comes up and is like, look at this,
like shows it right to my face.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm like, I opened my eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like everything's melting color wise.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, this is fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get up, look around and then it's over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's like 15 minutes less.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you just feel fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's not like the come down from
mushrooms or like, you just feel like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel fucking great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everyone smokes it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not every, pretty much everyone in the
band.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like, what's going on tonight?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, uh, the Foo Fighters are
playing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like, Oh fuck, we went on tour
with those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we hit up the Foo Fighters and item
Nate from the Foo Fighters.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, yeah, coming to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we come down with all these guys and we
get to the show and we're chilling and
[SPEAKER_04]: rise against his opening.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're hanging out with them and then
Foo Fighters play and everyone from fucked
[SPEAKER_04]: up leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just me and the kid that picked
me up from the airport or picked us up in
[SPEAKER_04]: the airport.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the Foo Fighters security guy who
was like my buddy on that tour,
[SPEAKER_04]: we smoked lunch together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on that way back when he's like,
Oh, go back to the dressing room and say
[SPEAKER_04]: hi to the guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we go into the dressing room and pass
me and Dave Grohl are both sitting there,
[SPEAKER_04]: both smoking joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, that's fucking crazy because
I asked them every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked Pat smear to smoke a joint with
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Walter never did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Took me to a wine tasting one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was always cool guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I helped give me a germs burn,
you know, always cool, but never wanted to
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke weed and he's smoking his own joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I look over and on the couch is a
guy rolling up joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's got face paint on.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just like the one that the elf
showed me in my DMT trip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's the same pattern of black and
white paint.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, Oh fuck, that's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: I turn, I start talking to all these other
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I can hear this dude talking to
Dave Grohl behind me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dave's like, Oh, this is this guy,
Damien who played in this band that went
[SPEAKER_04]: on tour.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I turn and the dude with the face
paints, like, do you want to smoke this
[SPEAKER_04]: joint with me?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, Oh yeah, man, I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I take, I take the joint light in and
he goes, Hey, my name is John.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I look and I realized it's Johnny
Depp.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got face paint on, but it's a hundred
percent Johnny Depp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Under this face paint.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, uh, and I don't want to say
like, you know, your hands or anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but I read in spin or maybe it was
details that was spin way back when that
[SPEAKER_04]: at a Florida punk reunion show that he had
gotten up and played some songs with his
[SPEAKER_04]: old punk band.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they called the fast cars,
which bothered me because there was the
[SPEAKER_04]: Manchester band.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it always like stuck out to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like, did you play in a punk band
back in the day called the fast cars?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, no, man, we were called the Z
cars.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, Oh, are you in a punk?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, Florida punk is my shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just start trading bands back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, he's like, you know,
this band, I'm like, yeah, what about this
[SPEAKER_04]: band?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes, do you know the screaming
sneakers?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the day before my friend in Melbourne
had given me a bootleg that he had done of
[SPEAKER_04]: the screaming sneakers, 12 inches of seven
ish that he'd just gotten back from the
[SPEAKER_04]: pressing plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had it in my nav sack.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, you mean this band and
Johnny Depp looks at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like this Rosebud moment where
he's like, starts crying and he's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: she's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I haven't seen her in years because
it's his ex girlfriend on the cover of the
[SPEAKER_04]: record.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he's just like looking at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he just starts talking to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like years and years ago now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this guy comes up to him who he's
there with and he's like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: John, we got to go back to set now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, Oh man, thanks buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he gave me a hug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Goodbye.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gave me the rest of the joint or gave me
another joint and then rolled his weed up
[SPEAKER_04]: in his pant leg and like walked off into
the sunset.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, that's so fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was telling that story years later.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Davey Havoc, when Davey Havoc was
on the podcast and I'm like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: and this manager came over to him and
said, John doesn't go to set.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, Oh, does this guy look like
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, Oh, that's not his manager.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my landlord.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's who's like John's best friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at Johnny Depp kicking it in makeup.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the weirdest shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they were filming Pirates of the
Caribbean three and he was going back to
[SPEAKER_04]: set afterwards and just kind of popped
over in between takes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a trip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my DMT trip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a fucked up DMT trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ending up with Johnny Depp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made me a believer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in the power of the,
uh, the God molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if it doesn't ego destroy,
I can do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is, that was the part of it that I
found most intriguing is the fact that
[SPEAKER_04]: there was no freak out component to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe if you spoke for us or yeah,
no, same.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I like acid more than
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I think mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same, same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mushrooms are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Acids way less wild for me than like
eating the fucking, you know, half ounce
[SPEAKER_01]: of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I got to do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just eat a few.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking to, uh, uh, a mother today
at her school gathering, who's a,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, a psychedelic therapist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she was like mushroom therapy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's like, yeah, the therapeutic dose
is seven grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, who the fuck does seven
grams as their first dose of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife's like, well, that's all I'm like,
I feel it after a gram and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of a lot for a first,
uh, first go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine what that would be like.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, yeah, no, it's, that's what we
do is like seven to 10 is a therapeutic
[SPEAKER_04]: dose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, and it's so counter to what the
cannabis, uh, guidelines are for dosing
[SPEAKER_04]: with cannabis where they're like,
okay, five grams to start off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, no, we're just starting off 10
grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get in the fucking pool and swim kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was always like, I would never want
to do it with a trip guide, but if I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: having to take seven grams of mushrooms,
I would, I need a life raft.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need like several trip guides.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the cool thing about our school
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's lots of like parents that you can
talk about this kind of shit with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, we should talk to another
time, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell everyone where to go get the,
uh, the new album in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where should they contact you?
[SPEAKER_01]: All that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I'm at left for Damien on Twitter or
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I do the podcast turned to punk,
which could be found anywhere.
