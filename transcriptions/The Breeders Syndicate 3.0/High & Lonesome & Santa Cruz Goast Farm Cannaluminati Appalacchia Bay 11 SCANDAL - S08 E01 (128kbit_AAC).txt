[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_04]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_04]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm your host, Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie,
[SPEAKER_04]: Not-so-dog, Breeder and grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_04]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here with my buddy, High and Lonesome,
and Santa Cruz Goat Farm Pack,
[SPEAKER_04]: and of course, Not-so-dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk about some of our
upcoming 4.20 stuff we got going on for
[SPEAKER_04]: the site.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to talk about some of
their history and some of their likes,
[SPEAKER_04]: wants, needs, desires in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys have been at it a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And have a lot to offer and a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this has been a long chase for both of
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of cool we get to get them
both at once at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we're going to go over some of
the party too, like what we saw at the
[SPEAKER_04]: party, what we liked, didn't, from what we
saw at the party, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they both have handy avatars.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do.
They do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come prepared, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Handy avatars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's start off.
[SPEAKER_04]: High and Lonesome, let's talk about some
of your new lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the lines that you have coming
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have, of course, have your Appalachia,
which is pretty well known for many
[SPEAKER_04]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you talk about it a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an F3 I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went back and I had actually worked the
line to F5.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't really happy with what I had
selected.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went back to the F2s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I popped 50 of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I selected two males and three females and
kind of let them go at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted more of the green crack side
coming through on the turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one thing you hear a lot about
Appalachia is about like the creamy,
[SPEAKER_02]: milky stuff coming through in crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more a fan of the tropical side of the
green crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same.
[SPEAKER_02]: That creaminess kind of came through the
Trace Dog male that I used.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those that I popped, they were very
potent, like the females, but they didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have the rankness that you would expect
with a Kim D.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: How did that cross to the Appalachia?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, did none of the rankness really
crossed over in the outcrosses?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see it in different generations?
[SPEAKER_04]: Any of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a ton, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more of like a sweet cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you see it in Stardogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see it in a Kim 4 too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like a bit sweeter,
not as nasty, not as like disgusting
[SPEAKER_02]: garbage as Kim D.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so that's kind of what I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to go back to the F3,
kind of narrow it down instead of keeping
[SPEAKER_02]: it wide open, narrow it down to what I
wanted out of it and what I like.
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you like about the green crack?
[SPEAKER_04]: It made you want to choose that as a mom,
or was it just like one of the moms that
[SPEAKER_04]: you happen to have in the room when you
were doing the run?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what was specifically going on in
your mind?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, originally when I did it,
I was doing quite a bit outdoor on the
[SPEAKER_02]: East Coast, probably middle 2000s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And green crack performed extremely well
outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, except it needed some staking,
which, you know, when you're gorilla
[SPEAKER_02]: growing, you can't do, you can't grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't, you know, it's a pain in the
ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to put, I wanted to put it on
a little bit more robust frame.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd had Kim D for a little bit at that
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I was smoking it a lot and
that's what I wanted to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the plants were also extremely robust.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I crossed it to green crack,
purple Urkel, Kim 4, Kim D, an Acapulco
[SPEAKER_02]: gold cut that I had at the time and,
uh, abusive, uh, OG touch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Acapulco gold cross, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never grew that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave them all out to friends and I never
really heard anything back about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, uh, the only two that have any kind
of lasting value are the, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: the green crack cross and the purple Urkel
cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you said there was a Kim 4 trade
dog too, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, um, what I found in it was
very similar to start off.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some really nice Kim type plants
in there and, you know, some stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't, wasn't as ranked, you know,
some, some of that creamy sweetness coming
[SPEAKER_02]: through, but still, you know, extremely
good quality smoking plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think you got what you wanted out
initially out of the trace dog?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, I kind of wish I had gone back
through some F2s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a few F2s, but I never really
pursued it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, at this point the seeds
are no longer viable, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it's, it's cool line.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, um, you know, I feel like if you
F2 that you'd open up a lot of stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, trace dog and Kim 4 is kind of
like your own version of Stardog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, isn't trace dog, isn't,
I mean, it's, it'd be a different mail or
[SPEAKER_01]: it'd be a different selection from the
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, um, I just made a kind of personal
amount of them to go through.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a, I always like to keep like a
doomsday spash of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so like, you know, if I was all my
friends and all my cuts and just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I'm, you know, oh, just a new
dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody floating around out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can have something to go back to,
to look through even, even plants that I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't like how I usually will pollinate
them before I drop them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you just never know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like something down the line might trigger
that sense member.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, I really wish I had that,
even though at the time it doesn't even
[SPEAKER_04]: seem viable or feasible.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just, you know, it's fun to waste all
that space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And energy and time, money.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I thought about before,
before we get too far away from it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just the point I might make,
which is that, uh, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing a multi-stage breeding
thing to save seeds from every stage of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way, if you feel like you screw
up, which is often, you can go back and be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Oh, I'd want to redo it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was just talking about, I took it to
F5 and I didn't really like some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: direction that it went.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, then I went back all the way a few
generations and started taking it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: different direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I hear about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like people say they do that all the time,
but there is very rarely any proof of
[SPEAKER_04]: anyone ever doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're like, you've seen it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've seen the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been X amount of years between it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that that's possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually have the F5s of Appalachia
here from him.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know he took it to F5 and went back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's, that's pretty
commendable because you just don't see it
[SPEAKER_04]: very often.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think like too, like the era that,
that high and lonesome is talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, I think it was more common for
people to like play around and work their
[SPEAKER_01]: own little lines a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was way before there was like a bunch
of like American seed sales or anything
[SPEAKER_01]: like that happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's kind of like a, you make seeds
and it's a one-off and they exist until
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I think it was a little bit more
common, you know, at least amongst like
[SPEAKER_01]: weed nerds.
[SPEAKER_01]: To like, you know, you make something and
then it kind of becomes the base of what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing and you cross it to this and
you cross it to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, it, it, it,
and a lot of it, like he was saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all about like, I'm breeding for
personal smoke.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which gives you, it gives you a lot more
freedom than if you're breeding for the
[SPEAKER_01]: market because you're just breeding for
things that you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it all started, you know, the whole,
even just growing, it started by trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure I had the best quality weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I think that's the best way to
breed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I mean, it's, it's, it's,
you're not being true to yourself if
[SPEAKER_04]: you're not, because how are you going to
enjoy the smoke and like go through tons
[SPEAKER_04]: of different, you know, examples and not
enjoy it and pick a keeper that you don't
[SPEAKER_04]: enjoy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really hard to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can lose a lot of, a lot of passion
for something real fast by, by cheapening
[SPEAKER_04]: it that way, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's some people out there that
like all their phenos and stuff that they
[SPEAKER_01]: get found, get found by other people
because those breeders don't crack them
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make them, name them, package them,
sell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they find out through others,
whether or not anything good happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I would say that's kind of
become the standard these days a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit, but in the era that high and lonesome
is talking about, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 plus years ago or whatever,
I don't think that was the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get rid of anything back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And before we stray too far, I do want to
ask, cause I know this is going to be the
[SPEAKER_04]: number one question people want to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: When did you meet B, Bodhi, and when did
he acquire the Appalachia from you to
[SPEAKER_04]: work?
[SPEAKER_02]: So he and I had been, you know,
chatting and exchanging seeds on,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it might've originally been IC
Mag, but probably Oh six ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he'd send me a few things he
made.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd send him a few things I made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, when I did the Trace dog crosses,
I believe I sent all of them to him just
[SPEAKER_02]: for him to check out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't even know he'd popped any
until he hit me up asking if it was okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: if he released some seeds that he had made
with the Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, I, I'm not sure it was
something that he meant to do,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's just kind of how it worked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he made some really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, people are still popping it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are still passing out cuts from
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it was definitely a very
comprehensive job.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a crossing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everything relevant at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's a very common sentiment that a
lot of people feel that some of their
[SPEAKER_04]: favorite stuff came from that,
you know, like the, the Appalachia
[SPEAKER_04]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of my favorite moments ever in
life was being able to, to watch you and
[SPEAKER_04]: buddy meet in person for the first time
and then right away in the sunset.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet as that dude together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's a hell of a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was, that's, you know,
you meet him in person and he's actually
[SPEAKER_02]: genuine, you know, it's, it's a rare
thing, but he's as nice as he comes off
[SPEAKER_02]: and just a hell of a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it, you know, we were all
holding hands, staring out the window as
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys drove off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too bad it wasn't into the sunset,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just almost a little bit past
sunrise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody has a glow going on
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had, I had a nice, uh, pregnant glow the
next morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's talk about some of your stuff,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, uh, you kind of popped out of the
road works with, uh, some old cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have an old Afghan cut that you work
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you work with a lot of train wreck
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, one of your big releases, your first
big drop was a train wreck reversal and
[SPEAKER_04]: you hit a few things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, do you want to talk about some of
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, where do I begin?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've, uh, always kind of had
interest in genetics, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just growing over the years and what have
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, initially when I got into the
game, it was all clones for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, and my crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, you'd come across the
occasional seed pack or somebody,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like we'd shoot up to,
uh, where is it up to BC and grab things
[SPEAKER_00]: once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not beasters, but you know,
whatever seeds I had hidden, hidden in the
[SPEAKER_00]: corners up there in the gas lamp area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, as much as, as seeds
were available and like not so I was told
[SPEAKER_00]: the stories, you know, a lot of that was
going on down, down south from where I was
[SPEAKER_00]: at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was where I'm thinking is when I was
living up in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, up in the Northern part of the County,
um, you know, seeds were prolific down
[SPEAKER_00]: there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a reason that generations of
people, you know, breeding whatnot,
[SPEAKER_00]: but clones are just so accessible back in
the day that there wasn't really a need to
[SPEAKER_00]: go hunting and try to find whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it always kind of been on my radar,
but it never been necessarily something I
[SPEAKER_00]: turned towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, you know, um, being in the
game long enough, you come across certain
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts that you just fall in love with,
even if they fall out of style and what
[SPEAKER_00]: have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, um, I caught on pretty
quick in the two thousands, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the kind of turnover of things,
you know, you'd see something just be
[SPEAKER_00]: prolific and then would disappear and you
wouldn't see it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I determined that I would have to
hold onto some of these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and see where that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just, you know, years pass and all
of a sudden you become this keeper of
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the hell you thought was good
from way back when.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so that's kind of in terms of
just what my, uh, you know, the way my
[SPEAKER_00]: path was laid out with the whole growing
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, you know, fast forward to now,
um, you know, I've always been on,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the DL for the most part with what I
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't really have a big intention
of riding the wave into the legal market
[SPEAKER_00]: and try to go too heavy there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I like your choice of words there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Riding the wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't feel like, yeah, I was not,
uh, did not have my board out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't going to go that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, and so I decided,
well, you know, Hey man, this is part of
[SPEAKER_00]: my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to just move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing as my therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, but I also am kind of bored
here and I don't feel like living by the
[SPEAKER_00]: algorithm of the garden, so to speak,
like I had for so many years and I needed
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of pivot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, just like anything, you know,
considered doing that for years,
[SPEAKER_00]: but played around, but then, uh,
you know, um, come the time that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to get real bored, not wanting
to, to move forward, growing weight
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, you know, this is that right
time to have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get into the genetic side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so what do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll just kind of take what I
had in my, uh, armory and started messing
[SPEAKER_00]: around and here we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: How'd you find the crew in the first
place?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this crew right here, this crew,
I came across, I came across you guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, unlike some of, some of the
other cats in this, in this field,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I stayed true to, to trying to stay
under the radar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never got into the forums back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, not so knows we, you know,
send people to go buy your supplies at the
[SPEAKER_00]: store and not have your license plate get
a, you know, tag or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've just kind of always abided by that
code and never got onto the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, IG comes around,
I would say maybe 2017, 16, 17,
[SPEAKER_00]: 18, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And started thinking about reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Hey man, I got this,
this T-dub cut and you know, I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: see, I want to open her up and see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so started paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a matter of fact, I got in touch
with Brian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And asked him, Hey man, what's the deal?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, who's, who's the go-to here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you put your name on it,
you get ahold of Matt and here's my last
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, he's like, fuck this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna send him that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, this dude's a kook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, so anyway, yeah, long story short,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got in and then, uh, you know,
he vouched for me in terms of being
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody relatively solid in the field or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, for me, what it was,
which I appreciate by the way,
[SPEAKER_04]: you had, you said you had blue dream,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And for ever since I've lost that cut,
I've had people telling me, Hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: I got, I got that cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not once has anyone ever been able to
show me, but of it, I've seen pictures of
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff that looked just like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I would get it, it would smell
like fucking flow or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it just looked just like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you brought it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only does he have real blue dream,
he has train wreck too.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a little time capsules.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not only that, it wasn't just that it
was how well they were grown, how well
[SPEAKER_04]: they were cured.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, it hit all the points.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, God, this guy cares about
his fucking weed a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he cares about good weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of where I realized like
this, this is legit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see where this dude's,
what this dude's story is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And without going into detail,
too much detail, obviously you come from
[SPEAKER_04]: like the surf background, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you could say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, central coast, coastal life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not, I'm not a big,
I'm not a big surfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a skater or snowboarder kind of.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was a part of your culture,
who you hung out, the kind of group
[SPEAKER_04]: hanging out with them, why you would have
had access to these certain clones in the
[SPEAKER_04]: first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's definitely tied in,
it's tied into the whole lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, growing up in the,
in the nineties over here in the central
[SPEAKER_00]: coast, like you were getting away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't find weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You found a surfer, but yeah, you know,
I was, I was selling the weed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: surfer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And surfers usually had a pretty good
choice of weed back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a lot of them would travel around the
world, get some of the best weed on earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to have it, having the kind of
clientele you did without being specific,
[SPEAKER_04]: it, I learned, you know, that you had to
perform better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Better than others to have the kind of
clientele you did at the time,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I took notice of and why,
why I realized you, you had gotten so good
[SPEAKER_04]: at curing and drying and all that other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause they were, they were pretty high in
clientele.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and they're pretty picky,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, their dads were growers
and they grew up in the whole scene and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're around the world.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't, you can't bring swag to those
dudes and be like, yeah, I want a good
[SPEAKER_04]: price for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing maybe I should interject is
like, since high and lonesome was talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about green crack, and now we're talking
with pack about blue dream and train wreck
[SPEAKER_01]: is that there's some of these things that
like they became famous long enough ago
[SPEAKER_01]: and then kind of fell out of favor long
enough ago that people probably mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: only hear legends about them to some
degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people like Matt was saying,
get fakes or, you know, or get it poorly
[SPEAKER_01]: grown for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seed versions where they use the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that sucks about that is
that often people talk about why they got
[SPEAKER_01]: burned out on a certain cut, not why that
cut had lasting fans to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think with, with the three things I
just named with, you know, green crack or
[SPEAKER_01]: with, uh, you know, train wreck or blue
dream, all three of those, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, there's a reason there's, there's a
bunch of reasons why they got popular and
[SPEAKER_01]: people really enjoyed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they, um, you know, they ended up
getting burned out, you know, because
[SPEAKER_01]: people were growing huge amounts of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once huge amounts of it start growing,
a lot of people are doing it poorly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then all of a sudden it gets a
bad reputation and then something moves on
[SPEAKER_01]: and people lose track of the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you were saying, like maybe only
a few people end up holding onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people are surprised at how good
this thing they've heard of, but maybe in
[SPEAKER_01]: derogatory terms, you know, and I don't
mean, you know, I just, like there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot for me, like when, when high and
lonesome was talking, I was thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: how, you know, like basically once people
in like grass valley and certain other
[SPEAKER_01]: regions got green crack and started
growing seven to 10 pound outdoor plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of like midsy green crack is
what blue got turned people away from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it became accessible, but you know,
green crack is, you know, in extracts and
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, it actually has a
bunch of really nice terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a bunch of really nice structure to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a very like cool flavor done well,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indoor 70 day green crack is tough to
beat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm looking so forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just said, the other thing that
happens to people is they grow it too big
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they end up taking it 10 or 12
days early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's, it's done enough to pass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes all the difference too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the market gets flooded with a
bunch of, you know, I mean it definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: happened with green crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely both happened with blue
dream and train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: All three sort of suffered the same fate
in that they could be enough of a
[SPEAKER_01]: production plant that they got
overproduced and people thought the
[SPEAKER_01]: production version was the version when in
reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So damn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think blue dream took a bigger hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think blue dream took a much bigger hit
than just that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Green crack didn't because I knew who was,
who was releasing seeds of it and who
[SPEAKER_04]: wasn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there weren't a lot of seeds released
a green crack.
[SPEAKER_04]: There weren't like green crack seeds out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could buy up in mass, you know,
but blue dream, the second that thing
[SPEAKER_04]: kicked off, we had Emerald triangle seeds,
which was, I believe made in Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a, you had Humboldt seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had all these different companies
releasing their versions of what blue
[SPEAKER_04]: dream was, which was whatever spulk
Spanish company was pushing out as their
[SPEAKER_04]: blueberry haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's what cuts got passed around
is blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm convinced H and L that like in the,
in the dab era, uh, green crack has been
[SPEAKER_01]: named, renamed papaya.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of, a lot of those like tropical
turps and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they would never call it a green
crack extract, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But they'd have some green crack rosin and
they'd be like, Ooh, this is the papaya.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not to say that not so has any
knowledge that the papaya strain out there
[SPEAKER_04]: from the specific company is green crack.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's saying that's a, probably what
happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, you know, even 15 years ago when
people didn't want to buy green crack
[SPEAKER_02]: around here, it went as mango.
[SPEAKER_02]: It went as papaya.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, you know, that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's half a dozen names for blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe even more that got made because
people got blown out on it and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Oh, this isn't that this is blue
dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, you know, it reminds me of your
Barry white story.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and so, but, you know,
the point that I'll, I'll scroll back on
[SPEAKER_01]: is that if you take somebody who knows the
strain, like say pack or high and lonesome
[SPEAKER_01]: and they grow a nice two, three,
four, six ounce plant either in a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse or in an indoor environment,
people are going to be blown away by how
[SPEAKER_01]: good it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue with the party away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people have forgotten why those
things got so popular in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they only think they got popular
because you could get an eight pound
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor plant that was bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not what got them popular in
the beginning at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a grow in somebody's closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a three ounce, a three ounce green
crack plant is delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think a four ounce blue dream
is a damn delicious, especially how long
[SPEAKER_04]: did you take it pack this last time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, for the party, I pulled it early
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know it's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pulled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I pulled it at 60, 60,
61 days maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was super Barry for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've ever had for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you grow a cut for, you know,
you better, you better put out some work
[SPEAKER_00]: or some good work after 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really what, one of the things I,
you know, I remember talking to CSI about
[SPEAKER_01]: this probably, I don't know, eight years
ago or something where in his mind,
[SPEAKER_01]: going back to what pack was saying about
where he was up in Humboldt and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, train wreck was one of the first names
named clones that really spread around the
[SPEAKER_01]: growing community deeply in that zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there was lots of seeds and there was
lots of name stuff that got like here and
[SPEAKER_01]: there it popped up, but like train wreck
really kind of had its moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first train that you started
seeing people wear t-shirts with the name
[SPEAKER_00]: train wreck across the front.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_04]: I never seen the shirts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt clothing company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was up in, up in Arcata,
uh, 2001, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they got smart and started marketing
the strains on shirts and there weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: many, but train wreck was the one that was
like, you know, what you saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we never referred to it or at least my
crew being up in Arcata, it was never the
[SPEAKER_00]: Arcata train wreck until years later,
you know, um, as a, as a signifier,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in terms of where it came from,
it was just train, it was T-dub or train
[SPEAKER_00]: wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that popped up on the forums as a
designator, you know, once, once it,
[SPEAKER_02]: there used to be a few fake cuts and,
you know, people would talk a lot about
[SPEAKER_02]: the, you know, this is the Arcata cut or
this is the E 32 crew or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another one that was floating
around at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed to pop up once, uh, people
started releasing seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Dutch started, started messing
with it and, uh, was it, it was tucking
[SPEAKER_04]: wood horse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, tucking wood horse, the big train.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember using name dropping him again,
but I remember when, uh, even though
[SPEAKER_01]: they're discredited, when Filo's first
came out or something, uh, CSI called me
[SPEAKER_01]: up and he goes, do you want to know what,
uh, what DNA's, uh, lemon skunk tests as?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was all, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's all green crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like it kind of makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if they're both skunk one,
they would kind of like, maybe show up in
[SPEAKER_04]: some range together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just think like there's,
you know, and train wreck also,
[SPEAKER_01]: the other thing train wreck got known for
was that it was the like, but long before
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone used the word turpentine,
um, you know, uh, train wreck turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got, it got kind of a moniker of like,
Oh, people didn't know what that turp was,
[SPEAKER_01]: but train wreck was famous and well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Oh, this kind of smells like
train wreck to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a train wreck smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the Jack one, the Jack,
the Jack, the J one is, that's like train
[SPEAKER_00]: wreck, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, but those it's, so it's kind
of like, it's, it's almost a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say it's almost a bad
thing, but any strain that has the
[SPEAKER_01]: potential to be blown out huge has the
potential to get a bad reputation because
[SPEAKER_01]: people only try it blown out, huge,
not dried, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not cured.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Matt was saying about packs ability
to dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It and cure it and treat it nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so sometimes even getting a good
example of what made something famous can
[SPEAKER_01]: be harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I'll tell you what, man,
uh, you know, there's, there's times where
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it out and I won't smoke that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like, no, that's not, no,
I don't want to share that with somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have those runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our buddy, uh, our, you know, we had some
friends of ours to gather.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gathering that we had or whatever that
are quite a bit younger than us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really cool to have them try
some of the classics that had faded from
[SPEAKER_01]: popularity, like long before they came
onto the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really neat for me, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's where I noticed like the
kids love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, this is blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what it's like.
[SPEAKER_04]: What were people talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he was kind of nodding off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 10 o'clock, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm way older than you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to go take a train wreck bomb
hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is right before I put a sharpie in
his, in his pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was listening to an interview that
packet, uh, did not very long ago last
[SPEAKER_01]: week or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember you talking about like
train wreck was the weed that like you
[SPEAKER_01]: pulled some bong rips right before you had
to do a bunch of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it was get after it, we,
you know, it gave you that buzz where you
[SPEAKER_01]: felt like you could get some shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly so much so if you,
if you pulled a little bit early,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like you can train her to have
such a range of when you can pull it and
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want to get off of your does you
pull it a little bit early and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: so much more speedy, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's part of, uh,
part of what gave it its reputation of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, big blown out plants pulled it,
you know, 50 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it, it looks good enough at 50 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can yank it.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why green crack was big with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like you pound it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about getting seven of them in,
in a year if you're doing indoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's the, and that's another
key why people end up getting,
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like something's not that great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even tell you how much sour diesel
in Mendocino County was pulled as soon as
[SPEAKER_01]: it was good enough to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it probably should have gone into the
mid seventies and it hits 60 and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, it's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, you're not doing it for the love
at that point though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, but it's, it's like people
just don't, I don't think people see like
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the part about love that I don't
think people get where it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you, it's hard to come across
people that know how to grow it the right
[SPEAKER_01]: way that will take it the right amount of
time that'll dry it and cure it the right
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get that full effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of it's good enough to go
and it's good enough for the buyer won't
[SPEAKER_01]: reject it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, I'll tell you what, I can't say
I'm not guilty of that in my past,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, especially at certain points in
time where it was more economically
[SPEAKER_00]: feasible than you know, just for the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think when you stay in it long
enough, at least for me, it's like you
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of mature into your grower status,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like start reading high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to grow everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to get it all, whatever,
but then you start to kind of not only
[SPEAKER_00]: dial in the plant, but you dial in your
style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you dial in your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a different world to, you know,
consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't, you know, as many
connoisseurs people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted a bag of weed and you know,
they wanted it to be pretty and taste
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, if you could accomplish that
and then get a buzz, it was all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be fair, like if I was doing something
outside, like any of the things we just
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned, and it was fall, I could
probably let it go if I got good weather
[SPEAKER_01]: until it was perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I'm depping it and it's 90 to 100
degrees every day in Mendo, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: hit a point where it's all downhill from
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might not get that last five to
seven days that I would prefer out of it
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's going to go south because
it's 98 and it's hot and the flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: the calyxes are going to start to yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to start to get beat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to pay my rent, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, here we had, we had hurricanes
every fall, you know, or most every fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, in October you might
get, you know, six inches of rain in a
[SPEAKER_02]: week.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it just, it can be terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so sometimes it was good enough to go
October one, you know, it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to explain that to people all the
time when it comes to like nature farming,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, where you're using, using the
sun or whatever, that all downhill from
[SPEAKER_01]: here is an important decision to come to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is key because you can,
you can be like, Oh, I can make it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're like, I just made it
worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one of the reasons, one of the
reasons why I was stuck to indoor growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause you know, you get to play God in
terms of how long something's going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I mean, obviously, you know,
there's, there's good and bad with both,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's, it's an interesting distinction
because as an indoor grower, mainly,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that wasn't a consideration,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What time of the year it was, unless,
you know, I didn't have the right kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: insulation in the, in the place of growing
or whatnot.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we used, I mean, you know,
indoor, you know, not that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't go outside or whatever,
but the problem up here was that it got so
[SPEAKER_01]: hot and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always used to call it summer,
but yeah, same, same here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you knew that you knew the indoor
summer, but even just cause it was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you cannot keep your shit under a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's like people are running many
splits back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, many splits didn't, we didn't,
you know, it didn't, that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: technology is all the stuff that's common
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think people realized how slowly
we had, some of us adopted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember how hot the lights were.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you didn't use the shields and they'd
be hanging and you'd walk by them and
[SPEAKER_04]: smell your skin burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, you know how many burns I have my
elbows from running like octagons where I
[SPEAKER_00]: had three exposed bulbs hanging in the
middle and you had to get in there to do
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was always so brutal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, I always heard these wives
tales.
[SPEAKER_04]: River seeing my skin hanging off a bulb
and sizzling and it being just fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't explode, but I always heard
like, yeah, don't get your finger oils on
[SPEAKER_04]: that bulb.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll blow up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was always, always water.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are like finger oils.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, so I'd always like screw them in all
careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd always grab a hand towel and screw it
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I didn't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a couple of times in life where
like they hit the top of my ear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty sensitive spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm a tall, I'm a tall guy,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're moving around and you're
trying to, you know, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: but one of the things that we should
mention too is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't know high and lonesome if you
want to talk about this, but I would
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine that when you were crossing a
trace dog to, you know, to green crack,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you could talk for a minute about
like something that I'm always interested
[SPEAKER_01]: in, which is like what you were hoping
each parent was going to bring to the
[SPEAKER_01]: children.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, basically the only issues
I had with green crack were the structure
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, the, uh, struck the
structure and the high of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to, um, get something with a
little bit more robust structure and
[SPEAKER_02]: something that, you know, had a little
more, uh, not depth to the high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think that the care, the character
of green crack is really nice,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's something that maybe hits you
a little bit harder behind the eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still a skunk one high at the end of
the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, green crack in my opinion is just
skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's probably my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely my favorite of the skunk
one type plants by a big margin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cheese is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have run that several times over the
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I can't smoke it, but so much,
but something about the like rotten mango
[SPEAKER_02]: green crack as just so appealing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And another one of your, your really
well-known cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is probably what I knew you best
for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the cuts I chased the longest
was the poodle nuts cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you talk a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who selected the cut, where it came from,
et cetera?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, um, it was selected by a friend
of mine from IC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he went by 40 grit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then I think after that 40 ounce,
uh, several, several names over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he was blowing up warehouses of Urkel
before anybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: He always had the most dialed in Urkel,
his shit, you know, I remember smoking his
[SPEAKER_02]: weed and it just being, it was like
slingshotting him though it was dense,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it, it wasn't blown out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, his problem was he was running
warehouses of Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: He needed something with some hybrid
vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, then he and I used to bullshit a
bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that was one that when I was
making those crosses, I kind of pollinated
[SPEAKER_02]: the Urkel just to see if it was any more
vigorous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, uh, you know, once the seeds were
done, I sent a bunch out to him and he,
[SPEAKER_02]: he ran them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He found, I think two cuts that he really
liked, but that one was the one that
[SPEAKER_02]: looked more Urkely and it, you know,
it got purple, but it had increased vigor
[SPEAKER_02]: and increased potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he started, you know, running
warehouses of that and crushing it,
[SPEAKER_02]: loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and yeah, and his, I mean,
his cuts, his selection is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've crossed it to some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that line ended up being, you know,
as you went through generations of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was just more weird stuff popping up
from the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took it, I think to F4 and it was just,
you know, you'd get more mutants and it
[SPEAKER_02]: would just, it didn't have the vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could have fucked it up, but,
uh, you know, it just, it's one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: things that I couldn't go, but so deep
into.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can understand that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the actual pool nuts cut is super
unique looking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've seen it express this really
unique trait where it looks super knobby.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very hard to describe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, and I've seen pictures of some of
the outcrosses that have that same trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like bud structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The knobby bud structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, um, yeah, that, that kind of
surprised me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not quite the, you know, round balls
you get with Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it's, it's great weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells and I've told people this a
million times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like people always talk about smelling
cuts, smelling really rank and veg.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a perfect example of one for
me, where.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can take cuts of that in the living room
and in the bedroom, Brynn be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: did the skunk spray in here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it really does smell like skunk
spray when you kind of like veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it finishes up so sweet and nice,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's, it's very Urkel-y of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like Urkel does something similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has that similar skunky smell and veg
and you take cuts and it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: wow, this is going to be skunky AF.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you, when you flowered,
it's super grapey in the end, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it almost gets there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for people that are younger or
don't know or weren't around during the
[SPEAKER_01]: Urkel era, um, one of the big issues with
Urkel was that, uh, it's not a very
[SPEAKER_01]: branchy mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not easy to get a lot of cuts off it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people would veg it for a
long time before they bloomed it because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of a slow grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: The node spacing is insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urkel is one of those ones that you kind
of have to get it around the size you want
[SPEAKER_01]: it to be when you bloom it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's going to grow like six or
eight inches and stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a diesel or something that
has a butt, like it's going to double or
[SPEAKER_01]: triple in size and branch out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when Ion Lonesome was talking about
like his buddy wanting something with a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit better, bigger, uh,
Urkel took its time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of parted along, you know,
for me it was the node spacing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just, it was, it was, it was just
constant, just like node spacing,
[SPEAKER_04]: three centimeters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to thin it out and just constantly
stay on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took forever to veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be, you know, you could grow a
haze and the same time you could grow
[SPEAKER_02]: Urkel because you're going to have to veg
three times as long, four times as long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you flower it, you know,
it's, it's going to pretty much stay that
[SPEAKER_02]: size, like not just at six, eight inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my friends up here that were
successful growing Urkel, they would be
[SPEAKER_01]: blooming around of Urkel and they would be
vegging almost the entire bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For their next round to get the Urkel of
like the root ball and just the plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a sufficient size that they could then
throw it into the bloom when the,
[SPEAKER_01]: when the other round was done and get
going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come to think of it, Urkel is another cut
that got bastardized by like being passed
[SPEAKER_04]: all around and a lot of crap grows of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like, you know, you always hear
about how like lame and un-potent Urkel
[SPEAKER_04]: is, but like I've had my head ripped off
by good Urkel, like really legit put in my
[SPEAKER_04]: ass by good Urkel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all comes down to the grower and you
know, the conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you grow a giant outdoor Urkel,
it's just not going to be that quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I like Urkel quite a bit, but I have
to admit it doesn't hit me the way it hits
[SPEAKER_01]: some people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I will say Mr. Hill says you do not
like purples at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, you agree it's all chickweed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask not to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's good to, it's good to have
strong opinions, I suppose, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, Urkel is Urkel for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have this weird relationship with,
with Urkel and that whole round of purples
[SPEAKER_01]: because at least in Cal, I don't know it,
you know, we're high and lonesome is,
[SPEAKER_01]: but at least in California, it completely
changed the weed game.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is before like
Urkel and Mendo P and granddaddy purple
[SPEAKER_01]: and that like purple craze of like 040506
that kind of hit any good weed you grew,
[SPEAKER_01]: generally speaking, salt.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like the Urkel and the purple
wave was the very beginning of like
[SPEAKER_01]: brokers being like, do you have this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take as much of it as you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't, I don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to grow Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it, but I didn't want to grow it,
but that's what they were asking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a bunch of people that were
like, Hey man, I'm having a hard time
[SPEAKER_01]: moving my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, well, if I give you this
cut, they'll take every bit of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of started the movement of
like brokers want this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to grow this where I think,
I think everybody probably on this call
[SPEAKER_01]: would agree like before 2004, if you grew
fire weed, it was just going to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to have a home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like the name game with really
started with purple craze and with Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it went to diesels and it went to
cushions and cushions.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of those old strains,
like we were just talking train wreck,
[SPEAKER_01]: green crack, you know, blue dream,
you know, all these different things
[SPEAKER_01]: started getting lost to the wayside
because they weren't as easy to move as
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever was dominant in the scene at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're still playing that game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what ended up making them rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's crazy that it's awesome
that pack loved train wreck and blue dream
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to hold onto the real ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm very thankful for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of my collection is just stuff
that I personally liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I held onto it, you know, or,
you know, in high lonesome's case,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, that's really what preservation
needs is like different groups being like
[SPEAKER_01]: these cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to hold onto them and I'm
going to grow them nice, regardless of
[SPEAKER_01]: what the market is telling me because I
care about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that, that, that's the dividing
line between chasing the dollar and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it for the love of what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, when you, when you, when you hold
onto a cut long enough, it becomes a
[SPEAKER_00]: partner of yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I always say train wrecks,
the longest relationship I've ever had
[SPEAKER_00]: with a girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said the same thing about the Maui.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I popped it when I was 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow up with these things,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they become this intimate part of your
life, regardless of the people accepted or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's, if it's in your zone and it's
what you want, then it really doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: matter if it comes or goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it there, there was years we're
trying to work with just one plant in the
[SPEAKER_00]: corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me your monocropping it for,
you know, the whole 25 years I've had it
[SPEAKER_00]: or however long it's been, but you know,
she's, she's always, always kept that
[SPEAKER_00]: special place in my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've been around long
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the oldest guy in the world,
but I've been around long enough to know
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you wait long enough, shit comes
back around, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you, and you learned by watching
others, never hand your shit over to a
[SPEAKER_04]: tissue culture guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the other, the other thing I think
is interesting about what we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about is that all these elites that we're
talking about from back then came about in
[SPEAKER_01]: a time when elites only got popular if
enough people like to smoke them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this was an era where there was no,
no modern weed marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no hype machine yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like things got hyped because people
enjoyed growing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people had to enjoy growing
them for them to become popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everyone had to like it, but enough of
the community had to like it for it to be
[SPEAKER_01]: desirable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise it just kind of would fall by
the wayside.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I had my clockwork orange cut in
San Diego and down there, it sold really
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sold really well, but I was really
stingy with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did not like passing it out in those
who had it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I made sure they didn't pass it out
because it didn't get a lot of exposure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot, back then you couldn't
convince people that a strain was good
[SPEAKER_04]: unless they got to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just, it was very hard to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you couldn't force that artificial
hype.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very, very hard to have artificial
hype during those days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even stuff that was genuinely good,
if it didn't make it around, it just
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it just, if it was listed as,
as a $50 eighth in the back page of high
[SPEAKER_00]: times over Missouri, then it got some air
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the internet, probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like in the forums during like high
and lonesomes, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey day on the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think like the dog, what people call the
chem 91 now was probably more popular than
[SPEAKER_01]: it was in California because my friend
that passed it out to the three or four
[SPEAKER_01]: people that got it, he wouldn't let us
give it out anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for the most part, brokers were
like, well, how good can it be if I don't
have it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the forums is where the hype
machine kind of got going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have somebody post, you know,
an OG push thread, showing some pictures,
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about their cut, you know,
talking about what it goes for in
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would just look killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, people would go ape shit
over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of where it all started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, you know, people start arguing over
strange and, you know, it's, it's gotten a
lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: As to where we are today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the lupus headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that being one like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Names starting to get attached.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, people started getting
their names attached to cuts that they
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't create and they didn't pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just, you know, they were the,
the one on the forum who let it out to
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was now, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's, it's their cut as their name
attached to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, you know, that still goes on
today, you know, like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you better kick, you better kick
up royalties to some of these
[SPEAKER_04]: motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think, I do think there's,
I do think there's a difference between
[SPEAKER_01]: like your name gets attached to something
because people are trying to differentiate
[SPEAKER_01]: which one it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're saying comes from this person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were certainly some people early on,
um, like Loompa or, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ken from Ken's GDP or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they intentionally attached their
name for control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and some people didn't attach
their name for control.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like other, it's almost like
other, your friends give you a nickname.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like people on the forum started re
referring to things as a certain cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's sort of just organically happened
where other people were like, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to attach my name to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore I need credit or I need
money or I need seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or all the little dynamics that developed
around possession.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's funny is, is I can't think of a
single person that intentionally attached
[SPEAKER_01]: their name to a cut that was actually the
originator of the cut, made the seeds or
[SPEAKER_01]: popped it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, what about strawberry cough?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's a tough one because I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did he pop the seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he got a given time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, nothing against homie or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, obviously like the chem 91 got
skunk, it got skunked VA's name attached
[SPEAKER_01]: to it because he was the first person
talking on the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the three people I remember that
intentionally attached their name was like
[SPEAKER_01]: AJ attached his name to Sauer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ken attached his name to GDP and Loompa
attached his name to headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: All very choice people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can all hate me for it or whatever,
but I think those three, at least like
[SPEAKER_01]: they intentionally added their own name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think AJ was just the latest of the game
on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never, I never heard of that cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I took a little break from being
online and you know, any of, any of the
[SPEAKER_02]: forum stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got back on, uh, about when I got
onto IG and started hearing about AJ Sauer
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's like, man, I've never heard of
this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it just, there are so many
things that are like that, that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I never heard of that cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never heard of this Sauer cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just, let me just point out,
let me just point out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to not be a popular thing to put
yourself out there in this game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried, you know, pack, I try to make
that point all the time where it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: the skill sets that kept us safe for a
long time, which is kind of being
[SPEAKER_01]: invisible and keeping your head down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, a lot of us were
indoctrinated into that lifestyle for 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: 15, 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden in like 2012 or
2015, people start putting their faces
[SPEAKER_01]: onto things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that had never really happened before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it went against a lot of the,
and then people started associating,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like, you know, burner with
cookie or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where it was like the person that was
the most vocal ends up being like the
[SPEAKER_01]: expert or the person that's like the most
in charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever the strain is must be an
official subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what's, what's funny about that
too, is that I've had a bunch of talks
[SPEAKER_01]: with CSI, um, Urkel, I would say probably
blue dream and train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all kind of have very mysterious
origins.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, there's a lot of cuts out there that
like, I, there's a general consensus on
[SPEAKER_01]: most events that led to a cuts creation
and the people involved to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I've never, I mean, I've heard people
claim it, but I've never any of those
[SPEAKER_01]: three strains they popped up and who the
hell made them and where the hell did they
[SPEAKER_01]: come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: And still a mystery to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me, let me point out, you know,
that some of that might just be a design.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's, there's a bunch of old
boys that still grow that I have known
[SPEAKER_00]: over my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't touch the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they could care less about anything to
do with anything, but doing what the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, keep on keeping on growing the
way they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scammers love that because it doesn't give
them competition to the origin story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all of a sudden you can be like Urkel
came from my farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did this and there's not going to be
anyone that's going to compete it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a monk showed up on my property
and just happened to bless us with this,
[SPEAKER_01]: with this cut or whatever, you know,
yeah, that was almost like the Ken Estes
[SPEAKER_04]: GDP store.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at some point I got to cut in because
people are going to want to hear the Ken
[SPEAKER_04]: Estes story, you know, they're going to
want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to, I got something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple of questions myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, it's perfect time to bring it in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Ken Estes story from your point of
view, how did it go down?
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, you're the one that tipped
me off to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's got here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was the signal, Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were, I was kind of, I was kind of in
the process of stepping away from the
[SPEAKER_02]: forums and all of that, but I still
checked in every once in a while and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, mostly communicated with,
you know, some of, some of my old friends
[SPEAKER_02]: on there, Bode being one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one day you sent me a message,
kind of letting me know that Bode's female
[SPEAKER_02]: Appalachia cut that he kept.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had been entered into, what was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: The major cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a major cup, like the high
times.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just barely doing cups in the U S
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was like the San Francisco,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And evidently a cut had been taken from
Bode's mom room by, I guess a helper and
[SPEAKER_02]: somehow Ken got it and liked it enough
that he renamed it Bay 11 and entered it
[SPEAKER_02]: into the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he won the cup with that cut of
Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to follow up on the success,
created a seed line, not even using the
[SPEAKER_02]: cut to the best of my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I think, if I'm not mistaken,
I think it was he had an OG Kush seed line
[SPEAKER_02]: and he crossed that to green crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And figured, you know, it'd be close
enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was, that was what came out as
Bay 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember it being a, you know,
a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: People being like, this isn't what that
was, you know, drastically different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you kind of tipped me off to
that story on IC mag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember, you know, engaging in some
conversations about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was shocked that they admitted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, normally that I was kind
of down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like normally that stuff stays wrapped up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was, it would have been cool to,
you know, have won a cup with the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was still when cups mattered.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like at that time there was, it wasn't
like fully bastardized to where there were
[SPEAKER_04]: thousands of cups, you know, hundreds of
cups a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, it was when cups, winning a cup
could mean the difference between a
[SPEAKER_04]: thriving business or not, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really pushed Ken's business.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, most people already knew who Ken
was from GDP because he had marketed
[SPEAKER_04]: himself with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the cup win boosted the sales for that
Bay 11 and his whole company and seed
[SPEAKER_04]: launch massively.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was why I was like, this is fucking
gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even the GDP thing with Ken is,
is pretty suspect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's completely suspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, I, you know, I don't tell this
story very much and I'll have to be kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like, I'll have to circumvent around
certain parts of it, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the person that I'm going to talk
about is like a total anarchist outlaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were just mentioning who would
never want their name to be known.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that person is who Ken got the GDP
from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up in my, up in my neck of the woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she, it actually came from a retiring
Vietnam vet who lived up in the Hills by
[SPEAKER_01]: me in the Leytonville area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my friend was pretty and female,
which was pretty rare in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But especially as Pac will know,
especially in the Humboldt or Mendo Hills,
[SPEAKER_01]: even rare for a person to like own their
own properties and be doing their own
[SPEAKER_01]: things or whatever else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty rare back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she was kind of gung ho about it and he
was kind of sweet on her a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he ended up giving her like,
I don't know, 50 or 80 seeds of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of his own hybrids that he had made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she found GDP in the first batch that
she followed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason I figured that out
really was because I helped her build like
[SPEAKER_01]: a, a 60 lighter in the woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I knew her before she knew Ken and
she gave it to Ken because they were
[SPEAKER_01]: partners together on this thing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she wanted to stay totally anonymous.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people don't realize this about,
but this is sort of like the era where
[SPEAKER_01]: like the first real dispensaries were
opening up in the bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Places like, yeah, like the, like you
probably remember pack like the third
[SPEAKER_01]: floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was the other one?
[SPEAKER_01]: The vapor room, the third floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a few of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not very many back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it was one you would always talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the one that Matt, that you were
a little bit more familiar with,
[SPEAKER_01]: but be that as it may, Ken was willing,
she wanted to stay up in the Hills and
[SPEAKER_01]: stay anonymous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was willing to go to the bay and
market it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it kind of became Ken's GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was, and there was no,
she was fine with it because the last
[SPEAKER_01]: thing on earth she wanted to do was attach
her name or show her face.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was under the radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had a, she had, you know, I mean,
a 60 lighter was a big deal back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a diesel thing in the woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: She wanted to stay completely hidden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and that's kind of why Ken's story
changes because he heard it secondhand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That story.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if people want to hear the full story,
from the, the werewolf's mouth,
[SPEAKER_04]: it is there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go on Google.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look up Ken's GDP story,
I forgot what the name of the thing is,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's some like rapper guy interviewing
Ken about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he tells this real mumbly story and
you can still find the transcript that I
[SPEAKER_04]: wrote online if you look for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually transcribed it because
it's, it's a little screwy until you
[SPEAKER_04]: transcribe and actually see what he's
saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he says that native American like
shamans thought he was a really great
[SPEAKER_04]: white dude and helped them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And decided that he, they were going to
gift him this magical purple Vietnamese
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where this came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's interesting about that is that
the story goes is that the guy that gave
[SPEAKER_01]: my friend the seeds was a Vietnam vet and
had brought back some seeds from his
[SPEAKER_01]: adventures over there when he was in the
army.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, it's basically like, as you know,
it basically became hill weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where he took these sativa and he started
crossing it to some of the Indicas that
[SPEAKER_01]: started coming in into the Mendo humbled
area and trying to get a plant that would
[SPEAKER_01]: finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it sort of became that thing
where it's like, it was like on that hill
[SPEAKER_01]: and in that neighborhood or whatever,
it was like, they were running this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people had different versions,
you know, and it was unnamed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and when she popped them or
whatever, there was still a variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: like sativa to Indica leaning ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they always picked for the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always picked a little bit more of
the sativa leaners because they needed the
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they didn't want as much of the moldy
density probably too, but a little two,
[SPEAKER_01]: three foot chunky plant for, for,
you know, a woods in indoor situation was
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially in the early two thousands and
the way that people grew back then,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a whole bunch of a whole carpet
of plants that were only two and a half,
[SPEAKER_01]: three feet tall and chunked out was a
great look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but yeah, he, you know, he,
he, he got that exact cut from her and
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody even knows who she is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I was just going to say a
Vietnam vet jump from a Vietnam vet to the
[SPEAKER_00]: native American shaman.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the biggest leap, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, he did addition here in
addition there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was counting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, what's funny pack is like,
you know, with you living up in Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously it's, it's not like the,
the natives up there have like a super
[SPEAKER_01]: high opinion of like, you know,
random white dudes like Ken, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in Humboldt and stuff,
you know, humble cobalo, different places
[SPEAKER_01]: in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's a lot of resentment to white
people did not treat the natives that were
[SPEAKER_01]: living in the valleys very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, he basically, he had to make up
a story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whenever you make up a story,
sometimes the details change, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes or no, not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll ask you since you're from the
area, Ken Estes, yes or no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark Emory, many.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, uh, only because, um, you know,
uh, you know, he just, he basically like,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was, it was more than just Ken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he does, you know, he just took it
down to the third floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, he was one of those guys
that was willing to, there was not that
[SPEAKER_01]: many people from Mendo and Humboldt that
were willing to go into those dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: and funnel weed into them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People wanted to be anonymous and he was
willing to be not anonymous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result of that, he got his name
attached.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also a really good song on YouTube
called leave Ken alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it is so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot who the rapper is in it,
but it's all about Ken getting popped and
[SPEAKER_04]: leaving and leave him alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do description in maybe,
in maybe Ken's defense, just, just a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think this, you could apply this
to almost anyone that, uh, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: gets famous around weed is they get famous
and they get known for a particular story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's like, it becomes more of
maintaining their image than being honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that temptation is a really big
temptation and we could talk about lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: different people in the industry where,
you know, there's like not very well known
[SPEAKER_01]: details that are true, but you know,
they have a narrative and they have a
[SPEAKER_01]: public persona and their interest is
maintaining that public persona.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I, I saw this in the UFO world a
lot too, where people would be like famous
[SPEAKER_04]: for, let's say they claimed to have an
abduction or a UFO sighting and they'd get
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of acclaim for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe they did see something they
found to be anomalous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe these were, they were being totally
true or honest at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after that attention goes away and all
the adoration and admiration from people
[SPEAKER_04]: and the, you're so cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the recognition, they slowly get this
want need to get those endorphins or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever it is again, the admiration
flowing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they'll make it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll, they'll force it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll force that whatever it is and take
that reputation shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see that in weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It transfers over so well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, some people catch lightning in a
bottle once and they spend the rest of
[SPEAKER_04]: their life, like trying to just chasing
that dragon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Force that hype.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just looks pathetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a thirsty ego is what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or people make entire seed companies just
based around the one or two things that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're famous for and only do very
variations around those things because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what they're known for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super common.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, you were talking,
we, I don't know if it was Matt or you,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like you were talking about the train
wreck name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I heard, you know, wasn't there
rumors that like the E 32 it was because
[SPEAKER_01]: it was like the 32nd generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something like a 30 second attempt
to, to re repro the original.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something, something wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a H and L wasn't that a crew,
the E 32 crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if it was a crew,
but I remember that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that term coming out on the forums and it
was like, no, you don't have train wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have the arcade cut the E 32 cut
it's the one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember Calio Calio is a part of the E
32.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like an early DHK type thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know one person who'd know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of bug him about that mask,
but yeah, I was trying to remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I know it was that was it Berkeley
patients group that Eric worked out of
[SPEAKER_04]: that was his name on the forums,
like AE RIC.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was, it was the arcade,
whatever the dispensary was it opened up,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: BPG was different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 11, there was a club, like one of the
first clubs that opened up in Arcata was
[SPEAKER_00]: off of London street.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude Eric, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there was a Calio story from him
and then there was the train wreck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it does predate him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he is the cut that goes around is from
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I remember correctly, and I'm sure
someone will correct me if I get that
[SPEAKER_04]: wrong, but yeah, the E 32.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The, the cut that goes around that
everybody has came via him and was passed
[SPEAKER_04]: out via that collective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the a hundred percent original and
nobody has, yeah, not the rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was pretty extensively is done
in his research there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like what he was saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows that story about the,
I've never seen the 32 cut though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I haven't put it up against the
one that I've held onto, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys think it's that cut?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the same cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just, you know, seen the forum hype
about it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure that was out of there from
Eric.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure that's the one that
everybody has or that has it now or that
[SPEAKER_04]: had it back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's harder.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the one that CSI has then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll tell you that I'll tell you
that my cut didn't come from him directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my cut from the boys up in the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the story, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come 2000, you know, we're all into clones
and we're all popping seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, my roommate partner at the time
knew this girl in Arcata and she was real,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a cute little kid or whatever,
you know, kind of ditsy and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked her for some cuts and she's
like, sure, you know, someone's helping
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She runs up into the hills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say it was up in Neeland area
and got a flat of T.W.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brought it down and didn't tell them that
she wasn't getting it for her own readout.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, giving it to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was my first introduction to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't even seen it prior to that in the
years, a couple of years before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're growing this thing and then
come come to find out she's getting hawked
[SPEAKER_00]: by these cats all of a sudden because she
wasn't supposed to let that fucking thing
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly the same time that
Arcata, we didn't call Arcata Trenorik
[SPEAKER_00]: then, but Trenorik started getting really
prolific in Arcata and it was fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just you couldn't get away from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then not too long, you know,
two, three years into that, all of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden people were bringing their cuts in
and bringing their their work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, you know, rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you had 10 people line it up and
it was rare that you got that original,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, plant a cut from that plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's I think because of like the tuck
seed lines, the wood horse seed lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally got a hold of a wood horse.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can talk to him finally for an
interview, which would be cool,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he was responsible for a lot of the
train wreck out there, that head seed
[SPEAKER_04]: never grateful head H&O.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oriental Express, I think.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: But who had who else did something with
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Billy Goat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he did.
[SPEAKER_04]: He did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know he at least did the Oriental
Express, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could do a public service announcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't name your seed line after a famous
cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't, please don't pick a
different name.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why we've never seen the same SFV
OG cut after swerve release that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never again have we seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't name it the exact cut name,
please God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Larry or Tahoe are all kind of just
like up in the air on if you ever see
[SPEAKER_04]: those cuts again, that they'll ever be
anything like they were originally because
[SPEAKER_04]: so many seeds were sold under those exact
names.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it makes it makes it hard,
you know, and yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say that the Santa Cruz wreck
is not from Santa Cruz, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but that that's super common,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Matt and I were chatting about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you got snow in Humboldt,
it was Humboldt snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got it in Oregon, it was Oregon
snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got a new gene, it was Eugene snow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if you got it in Bakersfield,
there's Bakersfield snow because that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: different thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, people would get it
and they would change the name and they
[SPEAKER_01]: would bring it to different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like names have always been very,
very odd part of the history.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I found out about a local strain
here that I never heard of.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually a city in the mountains 45
minutes from here, but it's very close.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's called the Tehachapi terror.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I found it in a magazine from the 70s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know nothing else about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, it sounded so cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tehachapi terror.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some bag seed mashup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, bag seed mashup with garb.
[SPEAKER_01]: To you or to Matt, does anybody know,
like, what is the Blue Dream origin story?
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we've gone over, like, not knowing
what train wreck is, what is Blue Dream
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to be?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard I've heard a few different
theories.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue Dream wasn't in my world.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had green track and train wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue Dream wasn't as big out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only stuff I saw, you know,
was flown in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that specific cut was first given to me
by Bodhi and the people who kind of were
[SPEAKER_04]: around the Santa Cruz area that knew the
crowd that was giving it out or where it
[SPEAKER_04]: came from, all said it was 98 blueberry
from DJ.
[SPEAKER_04]: That specific cut that he would pass
around crossed specifically a super silver
[SPEAKER_04]: handle.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a blue hen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember seeing pictures of both in
the Canter Bible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not sure which came first on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they were both similar type plants
that I'd imagine you could find similar
[SPEAKER_04]: expressions if they were both using
similar lines to make them, I would
[SPEAKER_04]: imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the only variation I would add
to that I've heard is this haze that
[SPEAKER_00]: people refer to as the Santa Cruz haze
being being that cut that was used with
[SPEAKER_00]: the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have yet to see the Santa Cruz haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this is just a myth or if
it's I would I would almost bet my left
[SPEAKER_04]: nut that it would be a super silver haze
based on the turf profile and everything
[SPEAKER_04]: else.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be pretty, pretty dead on,
especially because how quickly it finishes
[SPEAKER_04]: still all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Johnny Blaze, I think was Neville's
haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was legend seed to Neville's
haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that one took a little bit longer
and it still got kind of big like
[SPEAKER_02]: Neville's.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could definitely see super silver haze
being the father pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember if I remember correctly,
I think super silver haze got dropped as a
[SPEAKER_01]: seed line in 97.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it won three cups in a row in in
in the cannabis cups in Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe it was like 97, 98,
99, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was 96.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was right around there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think about like old song super silver
haze cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if I cross that to the DJ's cut DJ's
mom of blueberry that he sold when he was
[SPEAKER_04]: going around giving lectures and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I cross those two, I'm pretty sure I
could nail that thing pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be pretty regular occurring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I could see how that could be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I'll interject is that at the
little gathering that we just had,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the favorite things I smoked was a
hybrid pack made that was a blue dream by
[SPEAKER_01]: train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the one of the things I'll say
about it is that I think turpentine has a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of depth to it, but it's so forward
and strong, like it overpowers a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that blue dream hybrid with train
wreck, that blue dream brought like a
[SPEAKER_01]: sweetness in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That almost like took like the edge off
that train wreck flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, but the flavor of train wreck
was still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just wasn't like the predominant knock
you just took a step back, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just took a step back.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was like a sweetness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like with cooking where like
you add some acidity or you add some,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you add something to balance out
your sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had that brightness come through that
had the right for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we joke a lot that like,
once you get turpentine in something,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really fucking hard to get it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't think anything could tame the
train wreck nose so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that hybrid, it really allowed the
turpentine to shine because it gave it a
[SPEAKER_01]: sweetness.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually did a review on the blue dream
train wreck in a previous episode in a
[SPEAKER_04]: short episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: So go check that out if you're interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I was, I was really impressed
because it was two things I was very
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with and they combined really
nicely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that surprised a lot of people and
may have been, I think other than the blue
[SPEAKER_04]: dream, I think that was probably the one
that everybody gravitated to pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all luck, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you still did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's luck with intention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I came home from the party and I
popped some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everybody did.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the impression that
that's kind of the impression that it made
[SPEAKER_01]: where I just had to say that, uh,
it too old school, you know, pretty famous
[SPEAKER_01]: things, uh, that crossed really well
together.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the one thing that I,
that I, I appreciate that by the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of you guys, I appreciate that,
you know, your input with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say that the thing that I was
struck most with was, um, not,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just T-Dub taking it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step, but then the train wreck comes
through and pushes up the potency a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, both of those in and of
themselves, if you don't, if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: used to smoking them, your body's not used
to taking it in, they can both hit you
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty hard in their own way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's, it was, it's nice to be able
to smoke both of the original parents side
[SPEAKER_00]: by side and then go over and hit,
hit that combination and see where it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of got enhanced or got pulled back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it was really, it was really a cool
treat to be able to watch my buddies,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and partake with my friends in
terms of looking at that in real time and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, getting that feedback, you know,
it's really kind of a special thing to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime you smoke like 60 things in two
and a half days, uh, it gets even just
[SPEAKER_01]: smelling things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smell five or six things in a row and
you're like, your nostrils are kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: burned out for 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, the quality of that, that hybrid
shown in my opinion, while we're talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about this stuff, let's talk about some of
the stuff we saw at the party and some of
[SPEAKER_04]: the different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things that we, uh, noticed didn't notice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, um, pack.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was your first time there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was your first time coming to the,
one of the gatherings.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, maybe, maybe you guys,
I don't know which one he wants to start,
[SPEAKER_04]: but talk about some of the screens you
saw, what you thought was the most unique,
[SPEAKER_04]: what you thought, uh, probably bummed you
out the most.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, as we were just talking
about it, talk stuff surprised me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, that, that one in
particular, um, just how the train wreck
[SPEAKER_02]: came through on some of his hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It, it took a backseat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown quite a few hybrids of train
rackets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally a variation on the theme,
you know, it's, it's train rack with a
[SPEAKER_02]: tiny bit of this or a tiny bit of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, his hybrid seems really
well blended.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one in particular, I really enjoyed,
um, uh, bidders grow of shoreline was
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and his, um, dog shit, uh,
elected Boogaloo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of those were great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was just a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, another one that really stood out to
me was the Death Star.
[SPEAKER_02]: The separate people, you know,
Panda brought some local brought some,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, and that had such a, it was a lot,
uh, rancor than I thought it'd be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost had like a Kim D rankness to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, you know, in that level as far as
potency, I would say, but it was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of being like that nasty garbage,
it was like nasty polyester.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's hard to say, but it was just,
it was, it's very complex, very frank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it's pretty fucking, it's fucking
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dug it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's, it's unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you pack?
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you see?
[SPEAKER_00]: It stood out, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, there's so much novelty
going around that it's hard to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: determine some from the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was blown away by the Cobb just for the
fact year old Cobb sitting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, Bodhi brought that
through those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure if I was supposed to eat it
or smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just smoked it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I thought we were supposed to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can, you can, and let me know
how that goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bodhi told me who made it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just stuck it up my, my, I think
that's probably what made you sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it probably was.
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably knew exactly what I was going
to do with it and poisoned it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I do with everything I get.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just goes like, what else did you like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I mean, honestly,
it's no jumped in before I could speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, you know, that the electric
boogaloo amazing, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I'll tell you what, uh,
that short line brought me back to my days
[SPEAKER_00]: in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just felt like, yeah,
man, I felt like it was 93 all over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a time capsule, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking so forward to growing that
too, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but, uh, you know, one that,
one that threw me off guard that I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't have gone and picked up,
um, on my own, but it happened to hit it
[SPEAKER_00]: and it, and somehow or another cut through
everything for me at that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember watching skid just laughing at
me, looking at me like, dude, you're stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that a, was that moon boat?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, that was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought, and you know, it could have
been that I was on the 25th hour of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might've been four in the morning,
you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember where I was, but I
remember hitting that and just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: floating off into this like other place
for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, feeling embarrassed because of,
you know, someone was laughing at me,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, my reaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked it enough to put a picture up of
it on Instagram and post about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was, it was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've gone, I've gone and revisited
it since because, you know, I was lucky
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to be able to bring some,
uh, party bags back and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really not that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's not something that I would
necessarily have in my armory,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in terms of, I want to grow this
and get into it, but I might, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I might do that if I had the right cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, that one stood out, uh,
you know, uh, our buddy Denali came
[SPEAKER_00]: through with some, some D, uh,
some sour Denali, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to this day, I'm still kind of just
breaking little pieces off because the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He brought some silver D too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked the silver D.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did that silver, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's silver Fox.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called silver Fox.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 21%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The 21%.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I made a post about that by the
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, purple scientific chimed in.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, yeah, that's not right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not how it should go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a few other people chimed in and were
like, yeah, my machine has, isn't working
[SPEAKER_04]: for me like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, maybe get turned it in,
get it tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, yeah, tell your friend
to, you know, get ahold of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll replace it.
[SPEAKER_04]: DM us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I DM them and they said, it's not mine,
but I'll, I'll be happy to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked to the guy and they're like,
what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, you told me to DM you.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, he didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And left it at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, no, that thing was, we all saw
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like everybody there sat around and
watched this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nail 21% on just ridiculous stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, I just got one more
shot out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more shot out if I can, uh,
to CB, uh, to our buddy crybaby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and some of the magic that he
weaves, uh, our friend Pada came down from
[SPEAKER_00]: way up North with an Arctic, uh,
made the trip down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, uh, another friend of our
ring, our friend of ours grew out the
[SPEAKER_00]: meteora for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And brought that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, somebody had had the,
uh, what is the BO, the burnt offering
[SPEAKER_00]: next to that, which is a, I guess,
a grandchild of the, uh, meteora.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was nice to have those side by side
because, um, you know, just smoking that
[SPEAKER_00]: for an offering a couple of months back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I was like, wow, this is very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not something you usually get,
um, often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, having that next to the meteora
for it, seeing that kind of, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: relation between the two of those,
those pretty interesting for me to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that definitely sticks out in my mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meteora four was probably my favorite,
like, uh, what would be traditionally
[SPEAKER_04]: considered sativa leaning type there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my favorite out of all of them in
that category.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so, what about you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not, not to go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a different tact.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in that, uh, my favorite part of
the gathering was the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I say that is because,
you know, when, when we threw these
[SPEAKER_01]: parties earlier, they were kind of based
around the Emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was sort of like a way for heads
and friends to gather after the sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: like the big, the big gathering itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and this time was different and then
it was intentional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it was friends that mostly talk
online to each other coming from,
[SPEAKER_01]: in some cases, literally all over America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming from the far East, from the far
North, from, you know, people spend a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of time and energy to make sure that they
could come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I really didn't get,
it was no joke once they hit the airport
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to where the party was,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do think that like, you know,
especially with COVID and stuff and people
[SPEAKER_01]: being trapped in their houses and being
able to spend a lot of time online,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can make some really good friends,
but I do think it really helps to spend a
[SPEAKER_01]: few days like breaking bread with someone,
getting baked with them, eating food,
[SPEAKER_01]: shooting the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, one of my, I mean,
one of my, one of my favorite muscles
[SPEAKER_01]: loved in, you know, one of my favorite
things about the event is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, our, our homie who's a bitter,
uh, you know, he gets up at like four 30
[SPEAKER_01]: in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he starts tough and whenever I go
to one of these events, I wake up and I
[SPEAKER_01]: just hear his laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to bitter and his wife for
holding it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this, there was this memory I
had where I got up in the morning and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, bitter was on like his like 12th joint
or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he was just a tent on trying all
this shit and high and lonesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just woke up and bitter handed him this
joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a chem D joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laced with a chem D Keith and high and
lonesome took two, three hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, man, this is like,
this is not the starter mix for my dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just, but, but you know,
faces to names, hearing people's voices,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting to see people's sense of humor
where it's not typed out, but it's in real
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, the internet is cool because
it brings, it can bring people together,
[SPEAKER_01]: but being able to spend time, I think,
and just, it was a, it's like a prop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a proper to me, like old school
harvest festival, where you have a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of real weed people sitting down,
making friends, talking shop, eating food,
[SPEAKER_01]: joking, sharing their passion basically,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that, you know, there was enough
of us there that each brought some of our
[SPEAKER_01]: old favorites, uh, that there was a lot of
good favorites there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't remember who it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, I'm not going to call them
out cause that would be rude or anything
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember Panda telling me that one
of the guys that came brought like all of
[SPEAKER_01]: this, like new schools off, you know,
and after he smoked the shoreline and the
[SPEAKER_01]: electric boogaloo and some trends and this
and that he like took all his weed and he
[SPEAKER_01]: put it back in the bag because he was
like, man, you know, I don't even care
[SPEAKER_01]: about my weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like this right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's neat because you know,
we're all older now or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't realize that stuff that we
have a lot of experience with most new
[SPEAKER_01]: school smokers that have only been around
for eight or 10 years missed the era of
[SPEAKER_01]: almost everything that all four of us have
been talking about this entire time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you started smoking in like 2010,
2012, if you kind of got into the scene in
[SPEAKER_01]: the last 10 or 15 years, um, you probably
didn't smoke real train wreck or real blue
[SPEAKER_01]: dream or real green crack or what the hell
is trace dog or you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause we eat, it's like a flash in the
pan, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and so for me, you know,
there's lots of, there's lots of favorites
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, but, um, I just, I, I enjoy
spending time around people who share my
[SPEAKER_01]: interests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aside from, aside from being able to get,
uh, to meet H&L in person, I say that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, even, even on that, you know,
like, so I'm in the kitchen and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: CSI and Bodie and H&L are all talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and they're like eating like,
you know, we're eating like smoked fish
[SPEAKER_01]: that Panda had brought down from Alaska
and we're smoking weed from over here and
[SPEAKER_01]: H &L and Bodie and, and CSI have known
each other since the early to mid two
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was probably the first time they
met in person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all three of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so even that, that kind of stuff
right there, I just think is super cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, me and H&L have a company together
and that was the first time we've met.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember I was like all, all,
all frantic as I came in the door.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I was the last one there and like,
I was driving.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was driving in the canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't see for shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was super dark.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was taken forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I finally get there and we had to bring
the dog because it's big and wild,
[SPEAKER_04]: nobody else going to take care of him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had to carry in like three rooms of
shit just for the dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I am dead tired.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember walking by hugging someone
I thought was Panda.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I've seen pictures of Panda,
but I'd never met Panda hugging him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thinking I hug Panda went downstairs,
came back upstairs and goes, where's my
[SPEAKER_04]: mother high and lonesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, all right, you already hug
me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, H&L had to go put a sticker
on his chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden he started getting all
kinds of attention once he put that
[SPEAKER_00]: sticker on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, aside from that, you know,
seed swapping, clone trading, talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about your favorite strains, getting to
share your favorite stuff with your
[SPEAKER_04]: friends, you know, uh, watching local
smoke P 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Watching the young and fucking smoking old
San Diego strain and like fall in love
[SPEAKER_04]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll throw this out there too,
is one of the things that I liked about a
[SPEAKER_01]: dead tour was that you could be at a
campsite hanging out with people,
[SPEAKER_01]: your age, people in their thirties,
people in their sixties, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: where a lot of, a lot of times you're
really only hanging out with like your own
[SPEAKER_01]: age group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had people there from their mid
twenties all the way up to their mid
[SPEAKER_01]: sixties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was probably a 40 or, you know,
I mean, probably like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Denali and his late, you know,
there was, there was some senior citizens
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some kids that were,
in our opinion, are barely out of their
[SPEAKER_01]: diapers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and I remember, you know,
and some that are barely in their diapers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember Panda looking over at me and
being like, dude, I've never been to
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like this in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: To be able to soak people out like that is
one of the coolest things on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I think I,
I think I stopped Matt once at one point
[SPEAKER_00]: and I looked at him and said, dude,
this is one of those moments in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's quite rare, uh, to come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, don't, you know, just recognize,
I wasn't telling him to recognize,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I recognize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think people taking their time and
their energy and money and flying and
[SPEAKER_01]: driving and prepping and all the effort
that went in to just have a nice time with
[SPEAKER_01]: friends for a weekend and talk shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I can't, I felt high,
honestly, like for days afterwards and it
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't, it was just, I just enjoyed myself
immensely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of positive intention for
being, that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, I think, uh,
I think that kind of like bonding with
[SPEAKER_01]: people in person is important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Brynn has never been to one of our
gatherings before my chick.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she went this time and like,
when we got home, she was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally get how you bonded with these
guys and like why you guys love each other
[SPEAKER_04]: as much as you do and why you guys are so
loyal and close.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, I love those dudes now too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like they're family.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell she's not in the room because
she didn't throw a shoe at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you what, dude, the one thing I
want to say about that is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the world that I was brought into,
cause I didn't grow up in the weed scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I jumped into, you know, junior high,
high school kind of thing, but the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the old cats that I, that brought me
in under their wings, that was the energy
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was the philosophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, there were people with
egos, of course, there's people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's nassals out there and
whatnot, but for the, for, for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part, there was this cultural like
consideration and this, this bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: picture that was going on besides the
plant and the plant brings you together,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's a certain way, you know,
of kind of interacting with people that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that really kind of solidified that era
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be able to fast forward 20 some odd
years and get a touch of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it tasted that again in a very
unique kind of situation, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of brought back some, some,
some hope on my behalf, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm watching everything else fall
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not joining the big, the big,
I guess I'm not riding the wave or at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point I'm not, and it's not my thing,
but to know that that was still well and
[SPEAKER_00]: alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all we had to do was, you know,
kind of let it unfold naturally and get
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there were a lot of, a lot of
young guys, like not to said, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a huge age gap, but you know, we're all
weed people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all, you know, very much similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've tried to drive home, like in our,
our, our discord Patreon to like the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the people that hang out there and the
breeder syndicate with us and talk stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: and like get really into the nerdy end of
stuff is like when they hear us talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: the can of Luminati, they like,
you know, they, they kind of first you're
[SPEAKER_04]: like, yeah, like some underground,
like, you know, you don't realize like it
[SPEAKER_04]: was named just kind of like a tongue in
cheek joke, just cause it was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: it wasn't anybody who gives a fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't any of the, the famous people
that you'd see in cannabis, like is the
[SPEAKER_04]: main faces.
[SPEAKER_04]: You wouldn't see Snoop Dogg here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You wouldn't see Sherpin.
[SPEAKER_04]: You wouldn't see any of those guys there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what you did have was the most
passionate people in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt like I, that's all it's ever been
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has nothing to do with how long you've
been doing it as nothing to nothing to do
[SPEAKER_04]: with how good you are at doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even that has to do with your passion,
your drive and like how intent you are to,
[SPEAKER_04]: to make this your, your passion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's how we all found each
other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be on the same level as a
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had never met from halfway across the
world and you guys are walking the door
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's as if you knew each other your
whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely think it, I definitely think
it strengthens some friendships,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the fact that it was pretty quick
either way, as far as the actual weed
[SPEAKER_01]: goes, since I pontificated a bunch about
like just like the human, the human
[SPEAKER_01]: element, you hit everybody feels super
clear that I think that the nineties and
[SPEAKER_01]: the early two thousands was sort of the
golden era of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so most of my favorites are things
from that era, you know, the Kims,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cushions, the train wrecks,
the blue dreams, the shoreline for my,
[SPEAKER_01]: for my age or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just find most of that older weed hits
me better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it gives me a better effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if it's a wide variety of
effects, it's the rare weed that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: made in the last five or six years that
hits me like some of that older stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having a bunch of friends bring
their personal favorites, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, we, he mentioned it,
but bitter brought, you know, two,
[SPEAKER_01]: three kinds, maybe four kinds of Kush
along with the electric Boogaloo along
[SPEAKER_01]: with the shoreline and then high and
lonesome had some Chem D and some,
[SPEAKER_01]: and some headband and then fire Chem D by
the way, and some, and some different
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, a pack had,
uh, you know, train wreck and blue dream
[SPEAKER_04]: and classic the blue garlic train wreck
was a big hit too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, there was, there was a
few different people that brought the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, you know, the death star and,
and just, you know, and just different
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, you know, it eventually,
you know, at first I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I wonder if there's going to be enough
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was like, man, I wonder if
there's enough places to put all this weed
[SPEAKER_01]: because it like, we kept moving tabletops
and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, well not so usually brings it all
like, like most of the parts parties it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's been like 90%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to bring me bringing a bunch
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was concerned.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was that way because, because I had
greenhouses and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if I'm like mono cropping,
say two things for the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have a 20 by 30 bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a bunch of headstache.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just me, you know, so the first
two, three parties we did, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt, I probably brought pounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like pounds of each individual
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably brought like, you know,
there was probably like four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds of like, you know, total,
but it was like 35 different things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, no, I think it was like one to two
pounds of like 35 different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other part of it is in a
commercial environment, just everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: sharing, being super generous,
giving samples to all their friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, CSI, uh, you know, dumped a
bunch of, uh, you know, various crosses
[SPEAKER_01]: he'd made on the ground so that anyone
could grab them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were exchanging seeds and
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I should shout out to,
I brought, you know, not everybody could
[SPEAKER_01]: do this because some people flew and
didn't drive, but yeah, I brought some
[SPEAKER_01]: mementos from my past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Matt brought a bunch of very cool,
um, magazines and old art and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, books, you know, rare, rare,
um, you know, catalogs of different things
[SPEAKER_01]: for people to look through and no one
stole anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so still, but that just, I think that
just ended up in my stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the only other person that brought
books, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just ended up in my stuff,
but, but just, just a bunch of friends,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cooking and eating out and,
and smoking things and chatting and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does make a difference.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the vibe too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it wasn't a competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't about who's got the biggest ego
or the biggest issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, really kind of this,
this joining, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I think that makes a difference too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, honestly, we've talked about,
like, do we want to make it like a cup
[SPEAKER_04]: event?
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked about it a few times to train
a few of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, I, I don't know,
man, would that change it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, cause even, even though it's all
really close friends as men were
[SPEAKER_04]: competitive, you know, to a degree.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have like a surprise or
something that we can all like argue over,
[SPEAKER_04]: like flex on it, even flex on each other
over, it just changes the vibe completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, the hard thing too,
is when you have a party like that with
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that weed works, it's like a
snapshot in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was things, there was friends of
ours that couldn't come because of
[SPEAKER_01]: conflicts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was weed that was almost done that
couldn't make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was on the line, you know,
but not quite ready to be in the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of like, what do I have
ready at the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of it was a little fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it was a little old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it was perfect, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But really what it was is it was mostly
just like, you know, it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody brought stuff and it's like,
here's what I do for love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's what I'm cropping right now to
survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's a variety of things that,
that incorporate all that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how better can it get,
man?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was, I mean, the only thing,
my only complaint with it was that it
[SPEAKER_01]: needed to be like an extra two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I needed, I needed like a humidifier
and throat lozenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had it in a pretty, we had it in a
pretty dry mountainous part of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with all the talking and smoking,
I was like a husk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you sounded bad at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all of those, most people I talked
to or heard their voice for three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: days afterwards were in the same position.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a minute to recover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to cry, baby.
[SPEAKER_04]: He sent this and I'll give a plug to the
company too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is that piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought it to the party and he sent it
out so we could use it at the party and
[SPEAKER_04]: the hook.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a molten.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they say it's the G Y Z R perk,
which it's just a few little holes,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's probably my favorite piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get like crap all in the lip,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the coolest things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the tornado.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's called a tornado,
like ash catcher thingy, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the other cool part was just,
I mean, I brought a, I brought a tube and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, but there was a bunch of different
vapes, you know, not only that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just like smoking, smoking the way
people prefer to smoke, which can vary
[SPEAKER_01]: widely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Local, local tried glass for his first
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had only ever smoked out of joints or
blunts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, bro, you have to try that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And after that he was a changed man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he trained and then he tried the
rip and he was even more mind blown that,
[SPEAKER_04]: that, that weed could taste like that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was funny with that old school
fucking vape box crew, like that method
[SPEAKER_01]: that we figured out with it or whatever,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then you just, and then what's
interesting about that is you smoke a
[SPEAKER_01]: joint, a blue dream, or you, or you vape
blue dream, or you take a bong hit of it
[SPEAKER_01]: and you get different qualities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not so, not so explain,
explain what that box was again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the box, it's like one of the what's in
the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so it's probably like one of the older
like vape devices that came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably been around for a good 20
years or longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long time and it's basically a
tapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you guys hear it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me stop that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got an interesting house here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like a wooden box that has
like a glass element with a ceramic on it
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can dial it in for how hot it
gets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it has like a, a glass mouthpiece
with a tube for lack of a better term that
[SPEAKER_01]: connects to another glass piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people would end up like filling
the glass, like really deep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get one or two nice hits and
then it kind of tastes like popcorny and
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of loses its flavor and it's hard
to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we figured out 20 years ago is if you
just grind up weed and you just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you just use the mouthpiece and you just
suck up a little bit, just enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the motion.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the motion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you do it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you do it?
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to like Hoover up the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what do you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you put it to your mouth?
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to put it to, I smoke by putting
things to my mouth and inhaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how other people do it,
but that's my method.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get you to pantomime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I, and so, you know, if you,
but if you just coat the, the screen with
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of weed, you can get two or
three really nice hits and then you can
[SPEAKER_01]: blow it out in a little bit of water or a
glass or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just is really user friendly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That completely changed my rip deck too
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, the VapeWears box, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: VapeWears and Vapor Brothers made them.
[SPEAKER_01]: VapeWear, Vapor Brothers, indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we smoked it a bunch and it kind of
fell in and out of favor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we figured out how to do it
that way, there was like a couple of year
[SPEAKER_01]: period where like that was the method.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do it any other way?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get really clean turps that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you get really like a really
good sense of like the profile of how the
[SPEAKER_01]: weed tastes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's a little bit of a
different buzz.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you get way higher in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, at least it's, it's, it's a noticeably
different high than smoking any other way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's got to be because like the
volatile shit that would normally burn
[SPEAKER_04]: away right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're actually experiencing what it's
like to, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing I'll say is that
since everyone was so generous with
[SPEAKER_01]: samples, I'm still smoking off samples I
brought home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a much better sense of a lot of
the weed at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did at the party because when you're at
the party, once you've smoked 27 kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: weed, eight hours through nine different
methods, you know, you're just looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: what cuts through at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like what cuts through, but it's
like, you know, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, then it's like,
I can wake up and I can do some chores and
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take a couple of hits of this and go
do some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be like, Oh, it does that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's got that kind of effect,
you know, like, Oh, it makes me want to
[SPEAKER_01]: sit down and do nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like Pac said with the train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, like it makes me want to move.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did any of you get to try the banana tie?
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit makes me want to move.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes my heart pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it a bit much for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the other part of it that
I, that I do like is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Pac used to live up in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do think that like Humboldt and
Mendo and going to, I call Santa Cruz,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the very edge of the weird bubble,
you know, but there's this bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: That there's enough weed people doing
stuff around you that there's somewhat of
[SPEAKER_01]: a community, you know, and we,
we got some friends that came out from
[SPEAKER_01]: Illinois and from Alaska and from here and
from there, that they're kind of like the
[SPEAKER_01]: only person like them in their little
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was really, it was really nice
to see, especially some of the younger
[SPEAKER_01]: guys get to hang out with a bunch of
people like them of all age groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think probably for them, it was like
more memorable even for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if memorable would be the
correct term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing how we're all so high, you're
probably not going to retain a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: memories.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember, I remember a fishing hook
almost hit me in the head a few times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, just, just speaking of that
bubble, not so that you brought up,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, I was telling H.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: a while back, you know, one of the reasons
why I didn't get on the farm back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: days, because, you know, I was in that
network from, you know, the network that I
[SPEAKER_00]: had around me was, you know, it was kind
of compartmentalized, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was the crews down in Big Sur
and you had your Monterey cats,
[SPEAKER_00]: seaside guests, and you had your people
in, you know, Santa Cruz and Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd never had a need to go outside of
whatever the network was that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: working within in terms of trying to reach
out or find out, you know, what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: with others or, you know, growing
techniques or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that it wasn't wouldn't have been
something that would have been helpful at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point, but because of my propensity
to not want to be on the radar whatsoever
[SPEAKER_00]: and even touch a computer and say anything
on there that had anything to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, I wasn't really compelled,
at least in my group, to have to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, feel like I need some connection
outside of what I'm doing on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wasn't really that kind of
lone wolf space, whereas a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, and H.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: could probably speak to this better than
me, but a lot of people who weren't so
[SPEAKER_00]: connected or had to be even more discrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I weren't going to talk to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like that was a great place to be
able to make those connections and really
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of figure out what was going on.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it was a whole different animal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you didn't you knew two guys,
maybe in the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, you know, if you wanted if you
wanted to be amongst people like you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you had to find them online because you
weren't talking to other people around you
[SPEAKER_02]: and doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weren't talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's still still kind of like that
here, even with, you know, some version of
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's still pretty pretty closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least, you know, the people that have
been doing it a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also think that because we're sort
of like a very small subset of a
[SPEAKER_01]: subculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a way like we love weed for weed,
you know, is that the either, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Internet is a way for lots of people
that have sort of unusual interests to
[SPEAKER_01]: find each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, from all kinds of walks of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either that or bathroom stalls.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only have two choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, so they tell I got
NASA's number indeed right off the
[SPEAKER_01]: bathroom stall.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, I, I, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's it's that, you know,
even in met people think I get it all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time where people think that Mendo or
Humboldt is something that it isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because they, you know, they think
of it as like this weed Mecca,
[SPEAKER_01]: which it kind of is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also has all these elements that,
like, you wouldn't really get unless you
[SPEAKER_01]: live there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I but, you know, just, you know,
sharing time and energy with like minded
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals, I think is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I was like Pac, I too,
I was scared of the Internet, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: when Heaven Stairway and and Cannabis
World and Overgirl all got shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't very tech savvy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got worried that like everything I
didn't said would be permanently there
[SPEAKER_01]: that they could find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a screen merchant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those busts happened until like
three or four, if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't like when with High and
Lonesome being on ICMAG and all that,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I worked in that era.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just basically like you were on
someone else's computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was I was in Norca Lake County,
Mendo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was kind of a booming time
for my area for Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, not mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Matt, we didn't get you partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was what was the standout or
standouts for you, man?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, a blue dream just because like
I it's a classic for me because I'm such a
[SPEAKER_04]: blueberry head like.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's what I pull to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the main standouts, I know everybody
was stoked on the shoreline.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get to try that one because I was
so busy trying everything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what I remember everybody being
real stoked on and hearing about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I liked Caleb's flight plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's called Flight Risk or Flight Plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always get it wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flight risk, flight risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes more sense than flight plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was he had one called the
Blackberry Wine 69.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no unique and tasted and smelled
like wine, like Chardonnay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the sweet 16, I want to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinks and perp selection, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was from the pinks and perps like
the Blackberry Widow Hybrid Mendo perps
[SPEAKER_04]: type thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Real cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, kept going back to that jar,
as a matter of fact.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there was so much stuff there that
it was just ridiculous to try to go
[SPEAKER_04]: through it all there.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I got home, I didn't try the Death
Star much while I was there.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I got home, I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, P91, I finally got to try when I
got home and that was really good,
[SPEAKER_04]: really good grow of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Denali Silver Pearl, I never get
enough of Silver Pearl.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've never had Outdoor Silver Pearl
yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was still pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it actually had a pretty, pretty
strong high for Silver Pearl.
[SPEAKER_02]: 21%.
[SPEAKER_02]: 21%, at least.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I dug.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering, I have a bag of that
Silver Pearl that was smocked on the other
[SPEAKER_00]: night and it looked like something Denali
put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he gets you a nice backyard victory
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he gets to do a bunch of favorites
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him my Sour Diesel cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a pretty nice example of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even get to try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hard one outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the flavor varies a lot outdoor,
but the potency is there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wait, no, I take that back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did get to try that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: He sent it to me beforehand.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it really good outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, wow, this actually is really
good sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: At first he didn't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I don't know if this is good or
not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, no, it's actually coming
through in the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a great smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour is so variable outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like the high normally is
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the flavor and the looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, they are very, very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a long time high and lonesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really need a good season in order
to get it to express right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you really need that last two
weeks to be banging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it likes to go towards Halloween-ish
or even early November-ish at times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't always get that weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even in Mendo sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you get real nice warm dry
falls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other times it's rainy and cloudy and
problematic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my phone's about to die, Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're almost at two hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll touch on the 420 sale real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a sale coming up on 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some freebies from high and
lonesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the freebies you're going to be
throwing in?
[SPEAKER_02]: They are the mule skinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is GMO cross to Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Goat Farm is going to be a part of it,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's going to be the freebies with
your stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to throw in maybe
we're going to do that Afghan arcade
[SPEAKER_00]: across.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got something called Hell
Melon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell Melon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a watermelon skittles hybrid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watermelon skittles hybrid crossed with an
A.
[SPEAKER_00]: F3 Angelica, which is one of Bodhi's cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: A buddy of mine had been working on that
for quite some time around here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Angelica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it to a nice spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be something.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have a few things from
both of those gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll be having a big percentage off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll be throwing in some other
freebies, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be letting everybody know about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Molten Glass again for this
awesome glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is my favorite piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: And shout out to Crybaby for hooking it
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we wish you would have been there this
year, but you weren't, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next time around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would just like to throw in that
when Matt convinced me to start chatting
[SPEAKER_01]: in public, we kind of wanted to bring real
weed talk without so much promotion into
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everybody on this chat today is my
very good friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so any time I get to chat with my
homies, it's always a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm super glad that High and
Lonesome and Pac and all of us,
[SPEAKER_01]: we got to chat for the last couple of
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That damn time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to mention that,
that, you know, everybody on this podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: today is my really good friend and I
appreciate them a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
Likewise.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_04]: Any closing thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my closing thought was this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to be pretty much.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you know you got one?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, the positive vibes coming from
not so pretty much covers it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we all do this for the love of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just great to see like minded
folks out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, just stuck to be part of a
good group of people, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sharing a similar philosophy that goes
beyond just chasing the dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool to.
[SPEAKER_00]: To know that that's well and alive and.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and you got some merch coming
out soon, too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, we're always in the lab
doing something around here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say I would say keep your eye out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know if anyone does
follow on Instagram or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a tendency to kind of post some
things that I'll be working with maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of months ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's for me to get an idea as to
what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all part of the vetting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're wondering what might be
coming down the pipe here in the next six
[SPEAKER_00]: months to a year or shorter, you know,
there's some good things in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say that shoreline is on that
shoreline and the green crack is on the
[SPEAKER_00]: list.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, maybe maybe some blue dream
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, who knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And collabs with you in a high and
lonesome in the future, maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's in the books.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's on.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's on the radar.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, you know, I'm just stoked to
watch my good buddies want to grow some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit I've been putting together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It knows, you know, going to be popping
some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, things are starting to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm just thankful to be part
of it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's you know, you create you not so
create something really unique here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I personally have I grew up reading
like high and lonesome stuff like on the
[SPEAKER_04]: forums.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do becoming going from being like an
admirer to one of my best friends has been
[SPEAKER_04]: a huge honor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And same with you back learning you
learning, learning who you are and who you
[SPEAKER_04]: are behind like your Instagram person.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the person behind that and how you're
involved and stuff has been pretty mind
[SPEAKER_04]: blowing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty been really cool getting to
introduce you to everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they get to learn your story,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And slowly, slowly, hopefully everybody
else will over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see how it goes.
