[SPEAKER_03]: Breeders' Syndicate Update.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only is our merch store up at
syndicategear.com, but all episodes will
[SPEAKER_03]: remain free.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we need from you is interaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're watching the show for your first
time, kick back and enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like the show, feel free to like
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's your second viewing,
we ask a gentle person's agreement that
[SPEAKER_03]: you click the subscribe button.
[SPEAKER_03]: It costs you nothing, but it helps us
tremendously with the sneaky YouTube
[SPEAKER_03]: algorithm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leaving comments, telling not so his voice
lulls you into a trance works as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope you take the time to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We try to put out the best possible shows
for you we can and want to build this
[SPEAKER_03]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again from all of us at the
Breeders' Syndicate family.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like it was like I was connected
with everything around me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, I just started
questioning everything I'd ever been told.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, by the time I got high that very
first time when it started to hit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love that music.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, we're going to talk about
something that's been going on in the
[SPEAKER_03]: market you've been paying close attention
to, which is what's going to happen up to
[SPEAKER_03]: and post legalization as it pertains to
other countries importing cannabis to the
[SPEAKER_03]: United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we wanted to talk about some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know a few years ago, I started
seeing a lot of big breeders start moving
[SPEAKER_03]: to Colombia.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when I first noticed it was about
two or three years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was almost a mass exodus of some of
the breeders going down to Colombia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people are trying to import
American strains down to Colombia.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Breeder Steve was one of them down
there, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Charlie Garcia, those guys went down down
to Colombia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, must have told me about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot about Charlie.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, Charlie wrote me, too,
because he was so sad with all the things
[SPEAKER_05]: that had happened at ACE that he decided
to just go somewhere new.
[SPEAKER_05]: And being Spanish, he would fit down there
so well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet he's digging it in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I bet they're digging him,
probably treating him like a dignitary,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like royalty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would assume he's been around forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's done a lot, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would be a huge fit down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he knows a lot of people so that when
it comes time to market, he knows how to
[SPEAKER_03]: do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really understand the Colombia
market as much, but is Colombia as
[SPEAKER_03]: controlled by cartels as, say,
Mexico is currently?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe so.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the government has stepped in by
legalizing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they monitor everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there's money being passed around
to see who gets what licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that one article said that there
was how many?
[SPEAKER_05]: I said that there's only like 16 or six
that were allowed to produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was a lot of licenses for
growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were 60 or 70.
[SPEAKER_05]: So only 10% roughly were allowed to
produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'll be producing their own down
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with someone like Charlie or Breed or
Steve, they'll get the right genetics
[SPEAKER_05]: design.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure that Charlie's searching in
the back jungles and corners to find as
[SPEAKER_05]: close to land races as he can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he'd be one of those ideal people
for Colombia, I think, because he
[SPEAKER_03]: understands different types of not just
strains, but types of strains,
[SPEAKER_03]: how they grow in certain provinces and
certain elevations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think he'd be excellent for that,
like finding a strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he understands breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: He understands working a line,
acclimating it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, he's a great person to be down
there doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of shocked that there's so few
people allowed to produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that the US market has a cap
on the number of seed producers licensing
[SPEAKER_03]: licenses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's kind of late if there is
going to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's tens of thousands.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: So could they be so brilliant that they're
realizing that the future for their seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: would be if there are certain lines like
Chiba or Santa Marta Gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they can regulate and make sure that
the six breeders of seeds really have
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that when they sell them, it could be
Thailand's done something similar,
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I understand it, something similar with
their heritage strains, like the silk
[SPEAKER_03]: squirrel tail, the tiger tails,
snake teeth.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few other kinds from Thailand
they consider like heritage strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, they put a lady in charge of it
named I don't want to say a lady in charge
[SPEAKER_03]: of all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems that she doesn't even
understand that most of the ties that were
[SPEAKER_03]: sold during that era were Laotians.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she's putting out like this big thing
where like almost reparations that
[SPEAKER_03]: American farmers owe Thai people money for
growing Thai strains and using them over
[SPEAKER_03]: the years when, in fact, they're probably
Laotian strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: So her bringing this forward will kind of
probably point out that most Thai strains
[SPEAKER_03]: are Laotians and that probably the Thais
owe reparations to Laotians if she keeps
[SPEAKER_03]: pushing it that direction because she just
doesn't understand the culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: She doesn't understand the history of the
strains, but she's in charge of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's disappointing because I
feel like that happens a lot in corporate
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada and America, obviously in Thailand
is that you have corporate money coming in
[SPEAKER_03]: and corporate money choosing who is to
head the spearhead these campaigns.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the time, the people with the
money and incorporations do not have
[SPEAKER_03]: access to the people who have the
knowledge or have been keeping this
[SPEAKER_03]: clandestine stuff, keeping track of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The archivists, they just don't have
access to these people or even know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they wait to be approached by these
people who tell them, I am that person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I almost feel like they have no way to
check, do checks and balances on if this
[SPEAKER_03]: person is full of it or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's almost like to me, it feels
random on who they choose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you're going to be the lady.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be the guy to represent
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know a lot of Thai people or people
in Thailand right now that are super
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in land races and preservation
are a little upset about that because,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, now she's representing certain
strains as their heritage strains that may
[SPEAKER_03]: not even be they could be, you know,
Dutch hybrids of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they will always be pushed as their
heritage strain now because she said so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's it's fascinating the politics
that go behind all this stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: because you never really realize how much
it's going to affect potential future
[SPEAKER_03]: written down history.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I found the article from April 12th of
2019.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're talking two years ago and it says
there's 126 companies in Colombia at that
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's two years ago, but only 16 for
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: 126 have been cleared to grow and have
huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: But only 16 of those 126 were qualified to
produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Says these companies are allowed to
register genetics in batches of 10 at a
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the phytosanitary tests will mandate
them to cultivate a test batch,
[SPEAKER_05]: engages properties before it can go to the
market or register the genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Several well-known Colombian land race
strains will be featured.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are going to try to do that,
that heritage strain type thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Santa Marta Gold, Chiba, black.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, they choose someone like
Charlie to spearhead that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone that actually knows their business
or got a mustafunk or someone cool,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he's not there, but it would be
nice to consult.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure they'll need testers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do we know about the political
climate in Colombia?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we talked a little bit about cartels in
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you think this interplays with
moving the product from Colombia through
[SPEAKER_03]: Mexico?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's going to have to pass through
Mexico to get to the US unless it's done
[SPEAKER_03]: on airplanes, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I don't know why I would assume
that they can't do it on airplanes if it's
[SPEAKER_03]: legal, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still in like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Outlaw mindset.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to smuggle it.
[SPEAKER_05]: 747 packed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the way UPS will pack certain carrier
planes, they own them and use them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that size, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they'll be perfectly protected.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll keep them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows how they'll seal them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They may even back seal them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they'll glass bottle them
like some of the boutique companies in
[SPEAKER_05]: Northern California, but they'll
definitely, they've learned their lessons
[SPEAKER_05]: over decades.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they may have some that they ferment
on purpose and help bring about changes in
[SPEAKER_05]: the smoke qualities.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know when it will be, but once
we're federally legal, I bet they'll have
[SPEAKER_05]: their lobbyists already waiting and
already have their plans made.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may even right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when it happens, they'll rush in and
there'll be all these companies in America
[SPEAKER_05]: fighting saying, we need to have tariffs.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to have tariffs and stop them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll be interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Washington, DC battle.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it almost, I mean, it kind of
would be common sense that a lot of these
[SPEAKER_03]: companies, because we know a few years ago
that a lot of people moved down there and
[SPEAKER_03]: started doing this, that they are in these
what were once cartels, maybe,
[SPEAKER_03]: or maybe what is backed by clandestine
money in Colombia and Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have way more money than a lot of the
corporations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is what I've been trying to tell
people, like a lot of the people that are
[SPEAKER_03]: in the US right now, a lot of the major
companies, let's, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: smuggle schmoys, something like that level
of bigness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they may not have enough money at all
to be able to compete with the
[SPEAKER_03]: international market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's just a fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're not talking the hundreds of
millions of dollars that we have in
[SPEAKER_03]: America to invest in some of these
cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking like billions and trillions
of dollars being invested.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of these people, these companies
that were started by actual growers,
[SPEAKER_03]: in some cases, getting investments from
doctors, lawyers, chiropractors,
[SPEAKER_03]: that money is not going to hold any weight
when these guys come in.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to get crushed because
there's no way, just by simple economics,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the way it works is, if someone
has x amount of space, and it's 10 times
[SPEAKER_03]: the space that you have, and they can sell
it for pennies on the dollar compared to
[SPEAKER_03]: what you can afford to sell it at,
and they can afford to take a loss for 10
[SPEAKER_03]: years, there's no way to compete.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just how all capitalist markets
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a new market where, I guess you could
say this is not a new commodity,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's going to be considered a
commodity in a broader sense for the world
[SPEAKER_03]: term that people can invest in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a commodity like pork
bellies or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when those come into play,
it dumps out any mom and pop chance of
[SPEAKER_03]: being able to never compete again.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I was in charge of a big cannabis
operation in the United States,
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely have my representatives in
Colombia, Thailand, and tropical areas
[SPEAKER_05]: right now, which I wouldn't doubt.
[SPEAKER_05]: If Spain has such a large presence down
there from the people like Charlie that
[SPEAKER_05]: are the growers, then they have friends
who own stores and companies in their
[SPEAKER_05]: countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's plenty of millionaires,
and there's quite a few billionaires these
[SPEAKER_05]: days.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes more sense in South America,
I guess, or Mexico, or maybe even Thailand
[SPEAKER_05]: for the cartels that are doing other
things illegally, cane and opium,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then they make billions of dollars,
and now they can put it into something
[SPEAKER_05]: legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like washing their money.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like laundering their money to
retirement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you think Mexico is going to
interplay in this whole transition?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Mexico is a bit behind Colombia as
far as how people are set up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The politics are going to be much
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the level of political
corruption in Colombia, but I'd imagine
[SPEAKER_03]: it's somewhere in between Mexico and the
US as far as corruption in politics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wonder with the powers and the
money that the cartels have in Mexico,
[SPEAKER_03]: how they will be prepared to enter the
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because with all that land in Mexico and
as cheap as land is in Mexico,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it seems like that and the climate
are the determinant factors on where a
[SPEAKER_03]: person can grow cannabis, essentially,
on where these farms will start popping up
[SPEAKER_03]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gustavo Petro is a former guerrilla
fighter, and he is now the president in
[SPEAKER_05]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that makes a big difference because he
has a much different view, much more down
[SPEAKER_05]: to earth.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not like the high end only money
person.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's an economist, politician,
but he was a former guerrilla fighter,
[SPEAKER_05]: and he's been in president since 2020.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Mexico has too much corruption and
murder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Colombia used to be the kidnap capital of
the world, but Mexico is far and above it
[SPEAKER_05]: now because, I don't know, it's just so
split into so many factions.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you had only four big godfathers and
godmothers in Colombia or five,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was very organized.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Mexico, if you look at all the
cartels, the maps that show like 25
[SPEAKER_05]: different ones and they're trying to
combine and then others are fighting the
[SPEAKER_05]: others, I think Mexico will lag far
behind.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it's so close to the United
States that will have a spillover
[SPEAKER_05]: beneficial effect for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like think automobiles, everything
was Ford and Chevy, and then suddenly
[SPEAKER_05]: Toyota and all these other countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, German, okay, Volkswagen was
always here too, and BMW, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: But suddenly, when the imports started
flooding to the United States,
[SPEAKER_05]: they came in with some great quality and
stole away a lot of the market,
[SPEAKER_05]: and now they've been playing catch up for
years, Ford and Chevy.
[SPEAKER_05]: With electrifying, it's going to be
interesting because Tesla kind of broke
[SPEAKER_05]: the ground, but now there's companies in
China that make electric cars that are
[SPEAKER_05]: $7,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's gonna be hard to compete with
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if we tariff it 100%, it could 14,000
for an electric car just to use in your
[SPEAKER_05]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_05]: And around shopping and stuff,
those will sell like crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Affordable, affordable electric.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that'd be insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, it's funny is,
you know, I collect a lot of different
[SPEAKER_03]: things that I've talked about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And over the years, I've watched the
guitar market specifically and the
[SPEAKER_03]: knockoffs that have come and how fast the
turnaround time is on guitar knockoffs now
[SPEAKER_03]: is literally, it went from probably five
or six years from a model being released
[SPEAKER_03]: to where it is now, you were able to buy
that model bootleg in China pretty easily,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, for $300 to $400 as opposed to
$10,000 or $15,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: That much?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, that much of a difference
because they're doing like, they're doing
[SPEAKER_03]: like custom shop, like, like artist
edition versions, like perfect replicas
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can get and sell for 500 bucks
because they're doing it in mass,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're doing it so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they're down to they're down to
about two months, two months after each
[SPEAKER_03]: line is released per guitar maker.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a high selling line, they will
have it knocked off in two months now as
[SPEAKER_03]: opposed to six years.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no turnaround time whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I imagine it's like that with a lot of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: China is able to reproduce and produce on
such a level and on such an affordable
[SPEAKER_03]: level that we couldn't even begin to
understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Six cents a gram production price they're
predicting in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're going to see a replay in the
weed market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mexico could certainly compete in their
more tropical areas like Oaxaca and
[SPEAKER_05]: Guerrero because people live in the
mountains and they grow their own beans
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's a much simpler life like much of
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Colombia has some big cities, though,
and a port on the Caribbean and a port on
[SPEAKER_05]: the Atlantic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they can ship right from the Atlantic
side, right up to LA or San Diego,
[SPEAKER_05]: or they can ship right to Miami from,
you know, Buena Ventura.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is the one that's by Santa
Marta and it, you know, they could pick up
[SPEAKER_05]: a little Jamaican along the way,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you ever see a country like China
entering the cannabis market based on
[SPEAKER_03]: culture and religious aspects?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thailand and look at all of Southeast
Asia, you know, Kalimantan and,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the guys on the forums from
Australia, certain people, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: Wally Duck and Rocket Bong and a few bunch
of others.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've gotten strains from Sulawesi,
Kalimantan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are these are land races that
aren't polluted yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: There aren't any Dutch citizens,
well, hippies.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more difficult of a society to just
go over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Rob Clark's been there and so has
Shanti Baba, because they're both big
[SPEAKER_05]: fishermen and they love to fish from the
shore type.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Rob holds some records in New Zealand,
the annual things there that they have.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has world records.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have photos.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have his permission to pop them up
if he'd let me.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some amazing stuff he sent me of
him barely holding a 50 kilogram fish in
[SPEAKER_05]: his arms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like Papa Hemingway.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got white hair now and white.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's in his rubber clothes because he's on
the beach, you know, pulling these in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, he loves it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's his thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently Shanti Baba and he were
thinking of maybe even getting a little
[SPEAKER_05]: tiny resort in former Borneo, Kalimantan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?
Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wild in Borneo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over to some place where the people
running it were longtime friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, longtime friends and seed nerds
like strain nerds that you'd sit there and
[SPEAKER_03]: nerd.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, that'd be amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if it would ever be the time that
Americans can go to Colombia and not get
[SPEAKER_05]: kidnapped or bothered because from,
you know, someone from Spain speaking
[SPEAKER_05]: perfect Castilian Spanish, you know,
they're going to fit right in.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, Americans are still viewed,
I believe, in many of the countries like
[SPEAKER_05]: south of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's going to someone's going to be
willing to pay for you if I can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, maybe it's only 10 grand and not 10
million.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you were really special.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's only 400, you know,
but that's that's months of someone's
[SPEAKER_03]: livelihood there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's enough for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could get a special endorsement says,
do not kidnap.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was watching something the
other day on it was a guy that went to
[SPEAKER_03]: Pakistan and he was going there to go up
through the Kunduz Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, he was going from like the
Khyber Pass over the Kunduz Valley and up
[SPEAKER_03]: through Pakistan up through Nepal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone that he met along the way
were just the most kind, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: sweet people.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cultures there are absolutely insanely
sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like most of them, he'd be saying
like, have you ever seen Taliban out here?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, I've never seen a Taliban.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have Taliban.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe down in Peshawar, you know,
like in the big city.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're like, they've never been up
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like so they they one thing that they were
impressing in this video the whole time,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Pakistan people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were impressing like Americans are very
welcome here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love Americans.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love people from other cultures.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of these places he was going
were Greek, Greek descendants from when
[SPEAKER_03]: Alexander the Great passed through that
pastoral area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the Hunza Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the Hunza people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where this guy was staying with
a lot was with the Hunza people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just seem so nice and friendly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wonderful, wonderful culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a little booklet I got in the
health food store in the early 70s on the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole Hunza story and their diet.
[SPEAKER_05]: They eat a lot of apricots, which has a
lot of benefits.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're they don't eat a lot of meat.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they do, it's probably goat meat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They like to yak.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Hunza Valley until maybe 10 years ago
was very difficult to get to.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to trek for pays to get there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I know there is a road that leads in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the people are probably still
just as friendly.
[SPEAKER_05]: They called it like the Garden of Eden,
like it was a paradise hidden.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these people lived in perfect harmony
and whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have different districts,
different little regional voting areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not even voting like people in
charge that were voted in.
[SPEAKER_05]: By their their tribe because they were
such good people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that the dude who went there,
it was mostly because of the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: Shangri-La story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he was trying to figure out like
where where this was kind of considered or
[SPEAKER_03]: where it was just going in that area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, if I remember correctly,
it was either the Hunza people or
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere close to there where they were
saying they are not Muslim.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are looked at as second hand
citizens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really quite.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not given proper representation in
parliament in Pakistan and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're not a Muslim culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I thought that was absolutely
fascinating that this little tiny bastion
[SPEAKER_03]: of like free people exist in their own
little area in Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're just so sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: They seem sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I never been there, but they
seem sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was thinking about the Kogi people,
who were all white and they live in the
[SPEAKER_05]: Santa Marta Mountains, there's a beautiful
movie that came out maybe 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's called Message to Little Brother,
I think was the name of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I researched this the other day again,
and it's about an hour and a half long
[SPEAKER_05]: documentary.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can't go into the Kogi highest
villages.
[SPEAKER_05]: They they have them blocked on these paths
up into the Andes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get that far.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they won't let you be on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have the right to because it's
their land.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they they consider everyone else in
the world like us little brothers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were this was an environmental
movie showing how they have noticed the
[SPEAKER_05]: snow is no longer on top of Santa Marta.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the weather is changing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and it's because of little brother not
knowing what he's doing and toying with
[SPEAKER_05]: nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And right next door is Venezuela.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's parts of Venezuela and then
going to Guyana that are on almost
[SPEAKER_05]: unexplored.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that's the upper end of the
Amazon, which is also very little
[SPEAKER_05]: unexplored.
[SPEAKER_05]: And fortunately, there's people helping
the tribes there maintain their lands and
[SPEAKER_05]: hold back the people who chop down the
rainforest to make the palm oil
[SPEAKER_05]: plantations.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We live in interesting times, that's for
sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I I look forward to seeing Santa Marta
gold coming in original.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be so cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or what Hakan some strength of what Hakan
that no one knew existed because the
[SPEAKER_05]: people there were guarding it became legal
and they were no longer criminals.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had friends who were in the city who
knew how to bring it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it'll happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think that there's a good shot
that we have these Colombian gold and walk
[SPEAKER_03]: ins, even in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: seed collections, I'm sure, you know,
even even with Rob Clark and and and
[SPEAKER_03]: others like that, you know, Watson,
I'm sure they have these old stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Watson said a million times that
he has everything that he's ever touched
[SPEAKER_03]: and see stored frozen forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I hope that they do bring
these back out and grow them at point of
[SPEAKER_03]: origin type places, you know, like grow
them, go take it back to Colombia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow it at point of origin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring some of this natural stuff back that
that has been wiped out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one 1977 Guerrero seed that a
friend found in his desk.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not viable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And down the road with the advances in PCR
and DNA and RNA, it's very possible that
[SPEAKER_05]: they'll be able to deconstruct it just by
breaking the seed and taking the the
[SPEAKER_05]: remnants of whatever's in there and the
genetic code.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Re-engineer it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if this is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's very possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's GMO, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very, very, very possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I shouldn't imply that it's easy,
but it's definitely very possible to take
[SPEAKER_03]: something that has its genetic code.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they understand the genetic code
and how to reinsert it, it'll take years
[SPEAKER_03]: to understand the DNA map of cannabis and
what goes where and why.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's at some point they should be able
to have a would you call that like a blank
[SPEAKER_03]: canvas type seed that they can inject this
code into?
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely think that's in our very near
future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And something like that will be absolutely
so important to have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tissue culture is at a cutting edge right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the company that's really the most
advanced is in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they recently opened in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_05]: I contacted them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe a year or two years ago,
called them in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said at this point, having a
single seed like that, it isn't feasible,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's on its way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they feel very confident that they
will be able to take a seed, like you
[SPEAKER_05]: said, and somehow take what's left in it
and inject it into tissue culture and then
[SPEAKER_05]: grow it again and then cross it and make
new seeds of the exact same strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's not too far out.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't think so at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kerry Mullis is the cool guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a surfer too, who invented PCR
basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he died just a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: He wrote a really cool book that I have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he did a lot of acid when he was in
college.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he more or less saw the RNA helix or
whatever on acid.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what allowed him to then make
the final steps and make PCR real.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he worked for a company at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they got the patent for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got the Nobel Prize of chemistry that
year, by the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And his friend said, you should just quit
your job and then do it on the outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he estimated it would be worth this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is 20 years ago when he wrote this
book, I believe.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said it would have been worth about a
quarter billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And today it'd be worth probably 20
billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because PCR is used in everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you work for a company, they own you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they own your soul.
[SPEAKER_05]: All these books are nonfiction,
almost every single one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have probably 40, 50 fiction books.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now with the internet, I can skip most
of these books.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, they're still my friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't let go of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every move that I do is insane,
mostly because of my book collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many boxes of books.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know a lot of these are online.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, there's a lot that
aren't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the ones I've been trying to
scan in and get out there for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I really have this fervent desire
and belief that in order for us all to
[SPEAKER_03]: progress and get at the level to where I
wish people were when it comes to breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: and cannabis breeding and taking it
seriously, we all have to have access to
[SPEAKER_03]: the same information and be on the same
playing field, to have expectations of
[SPEAKER_03]: people to put in the work and to know
what's what.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I'm not making that available and I
have the resources to, then I'm part of
[SPEAKER_03]: the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm determined to get it all scanned.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had 10 feet of National Geographic
graphics at one point because my
[SPEAKER_05]: grandfather gave me a subscription when I
was nine years old and for the next 15
[SPEAKER_05]: years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when he died, a friend of mine
picked up where he left off and kept
[SPEAKER_05]: sending them to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: But once it went digital and I realized
you can search every copy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For what I need in my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave mine to the boys and girls clubs
and it was 600 pounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was so happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was so happy to give them away because
they would use them to cut out photos and
[SPEAKER_05]: watches or do whatever they're doing in
their class.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now in high times, that's a different
story.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give those to the boys and girls club.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely going to hold on to those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you need to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are special.
[SPEAKER_05]: Share them with people like you and other
friends.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like since since high times has put the
whole archive online, like I have several
[SPEAKER_03]: and I still find myself picking them up
every time that I see them for whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, man, I know I can just go
access it online.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's something about having a hard
copy from the 70s, being able to smell it
[SPEAKER_03]: and flip the pages.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's something about that that I'll
never be able to walk away from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smell of books, the feel of books.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I underline.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not keeping a book so that it'll be
valuable later unless it's one of the ones
[SPEAKER_05]: I collected as first editions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I index my books and I open the front
page and it's got my index.
[SPEAKER_05]: And.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just a small one where I,
you know, I wrote that many.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like page 91 is about shin splints.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about ligaments and.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that's what the beauty of books.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I never I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never really taken notes in books,
but I had or notes on books.
[SPEAKER_03]: Period.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always memorized what I could.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I when I was doing a lot of research,
I ran into a guy that just blew my mind
[SPEAKER_03]: because every single book, he had a long
list of everything he had ever read about
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he'd be like, have you read this book?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd be able to read real fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, this is so useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I would have done this for every book
that I've ever read, I could be helping a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of people like real fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I'm making a habit to do stuff like
that, to make notes, to, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it's super important.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is probably the best book on it's
called The Rocks Begin to Speak,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's by Levan Martinow and about
petroglyphs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And but this guy, he was raised on his
background.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's part Native American and he was
raised and this is how I index my books.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, all all the pages that have
things, word order, clarity, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of archaeologists thinks he's full
of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's no longer alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, he was the first to start,
like he said, rocks broke the silence.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've used his techniques personally in
even a magic cannon.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's lots of petroglyphs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's one that's very simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a circle with a dot in the
middle of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it means something.
[SPEAKER_05]: There.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you see this on the rock.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said he walked around the boulder
and on the backside, there was a spring.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had anyone in it didn't matter what
language you spoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all spoke sign language or rock
writing language.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you go to other countries like
Central America, South America,
[SPEAKER_05]: Asia, there's petroglyphs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, you know, hieroglyphs, all the glyphs
in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just wonderful to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's amazing stuff like that to
even be found in the United States,
[SPEAKER_03]: because United States, like when we think
about our history, we think of it
[SPEAKER_03]: traditionally being, you know,
600, 500 years old from the European
[SPEAKER_03]: conquest.
[SPEAKER_03]: But realistically, like like you said,
magic, there is a beautiful I've never
[SPEAKER_03]: seen petroglyphs in person, but I can
imagine the energy, the the vibrations
[SPEAKER_03]: around stuff like that has got to be
magical.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my favorites that I've found,
I think I sent you a link to the NFTs I
[SPEAKER_05]: made because I was searching when NFTs
first came out a few years ago,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I searched OpenSea and Rarible and all
these sites and no one had done anything
[SPEAKER_05]: with with weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I found one, finally one photo of a
of a flower some guy had posted on
[SPEAKER_05]: OpenSea.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And wove them together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of my favorite, most rare
petroglyphs I've ever found with my first
[SPEAKER_05]: grow partner, Doug, the second actually,
showed men on horseback.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was early Congistadors because they
have helmets.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a fairly rare thing to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a few in northern Arizona and
Utah as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is not in Madjag Canyon proper,
but five miles away on top of a mesa drops
[SPEAKER_05]: off into another canyon.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friend and I were hiking over to look
over the edge and see these other canyons.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were considering other grow spots and
we found this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's it's pretty stunning to see a
horse shape and a guy on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's got a helmet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this dates back to the first
conquistadors in the 1600s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Documenting seeing these guys come through
or like trying to figure out what they
[SPEAKER_05]: were seeing in the 1500s and 16s because
they conquistadors went through Arizona
[SPEAKER_05]: all the way up to the Hobie Reservation.
[SPEAKER_05]: They came also from Santa Fe, which was
their capital at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mogollon was one of the first Spanish
governors.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Mogollon was named after Juan
Ignacio Flores Mogollon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, I didn't know that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was for four years.
[SPEAKER_05]: In 16, like 10 or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was the governor.
OK.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see they're on horses clearly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're humanoid forms and they all
have headdresses on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the horse was introduced, as you know,
by conquistadors to North America.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were stolen many times.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they were traded that often
because they were too valuable in the
[SPEAKER_05]: early days.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Native Americans got some.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the Plains Indians, I mean,
there was hundreds, there was tens of
[SPEAKER_05]: thousands of wild horses at one point,
just like there were millions of buffalo.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were the main ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to go over rough terrain in the West,
the conquistadors, they don't show up in
[SPEAKER_05]: many petroglyphs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this one is beautiful.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like a freeze frame of one of
them talking, like looking back and
[SPEAKER_03]: talking to one of his other people,
like that they were, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like giving them orders, his hands up
directing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's three clear ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marching across there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then below that, at the back left,
it looks like another human feature,
[SPEAKER_05]: like he's on a horse perhaps, too,
or he's falling off.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then below, it's difficult to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the larger version that shows this
whole boulder.
[SPEAKER_05]: This section you're looking at here is
about two feet wide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, three feet wide and two feet tall,
this photo is.
[SPEAKER_05]: But each of those horses, petroglyphs,
are about, I'd say, eight inches tall,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe 10.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we saw that, we were like,
oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, they're not common.
[SPEAKER_03]: Has this been documented in any petroglyph
books, this picture that you've taken?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been wanting to go get with my
friends at Coconino National Forest.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've known them for 40 years, the
archaeologists there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a new head archaeologist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter Pillis was the previous
archaeologist, and he loved petroglyphs,
[SPEAKER_05]: too.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two huge sites outside of Sedona,
Honaki and Palatki.
[SPEAKER_05]: Palatki is open to the public.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honaki is where tours go, and they walk
you through and they describe stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Peter came down once and gave a
three-hour class that I was fortunate
[SPEAKER_05]: enough to be a part of with three other
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they went over what they were saying
about stuff, and then he told them if they
[SPEAKER_05]: were full of shit or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were 90% totally wrong.
I bet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like saying, this is the Shahn's cave.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, well, actually, in the
Sinawa, which means without water,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's the nickname the ancient people of
the Verdi Valley.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, there was no documented signs of
shamanism at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they called this the Shaman's cave
because of the petroglyphs that were
[SPEAKER_05]: associated with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then he would go through and then say
what was more likely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had already been a grower 20 years
before I met Peter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I shared some things with him,
but I never took my petroglyph book.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have all these as photos, which I've
since digitized, as you can tell here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was stunned ever, ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been to Newspaper Rock,
but this big one that's up near the Hopi
[SPEAKER_05]: Rez and other areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the largest in Northern Arizona is
called Newspaper Rock.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a site that was used for many
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: People would add to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like a newspaper they akin it
to because it had so much information that
[SPEAKER_05]: was obviously packed into the rock over
many decades, not just one person sat down
[SPEAKER_05]: for two years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ancient graffiti?
[SPEAKER_05]: This takes to do one of these figures.
[SPEAKER_05]: This patina is called desert varnish.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it appears on rocks as they get older,
certain types.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is volcanic rock.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it gets this brown or black.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to peck into it, it reveals the real
color of the lighter rock underneath.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it takes hours and hours to do one of
these.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're using another rock in your hand
that's hard, like maybe a piece of granite
[SPEAKER_05]: or something, and maybe a point so that
you can peck the design you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, this might have represented more
than one person leaving their information
[SPEAKER_05]: over many years.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the top three at least,
or the front two here, were probably
[SPEAKER_05]: simultaneous in one stretch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they spent a week doing this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think the part that catches me is
the guy in the middle with his hand up
[SPEAKER_03]: directing like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's almost obvious that he was
the boss.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever it was, they were portraying him
as the boss.
[SPEAKER_05]: He may have had a stick in his hand to
whip the horse with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it may have been they were portraying
that he had something.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was hitting the horse to make it go
faster.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know the Spanish used either.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be another interesting thing to
study.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's definitely something on his head.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the guy up front here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Had these been rival tribes in the Plains
Indians, they were lots of headdresses.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was the late 17s, I think,
or maybe mostly in the 1800s.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are going back to 15s and 1600s when
the first horses came through in the
[SPEAKER_05]: Sinawa and the Mogollon people saw them
passing through.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were just like, what the heck are
those?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they didn't even know what horses
were, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine?
[SPEAKER_05]: A horse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these humans on top of them,
just riding them around.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were wearing armor and helmets
because they were worried about getting
[SPEAKER_05]: shot by arrows.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How quickly, though, like the Plains
Indians adapted to be able to or Native
[SPEAKER_03]: Americans were adapted to be able to ride
horses and became very proficient
[SPEAKER_03]: horsemen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bareback, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just amazing how they adapted to
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it helped them hunt and made their
life easier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I they call them dog soldiers,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: The people that rode the early horses.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were they they were comparing horses
to large.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it feel like to be around these
petroglyphs?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get any like I know it's kind of
hard to quantify spiritual spirituality
[SPEAKER_03]: and feelings and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But did you ever get any kind of spark of
energy or any kind?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of sounds so weird saying that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But did you ever feel anything around
these petroglyphs?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, but it's hard to quantify.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you said, sitting next to a fire,
we made underground fire pits so that the
[SPEAKER_05]: flames wouldn't be visible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sixteen hundred feet above us was a small
Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ruins of it, just two foot walls.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the outlines created made about 20
rooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and down below the boulders that next
near the creek that had some of these
[SPEAKER_05]: petroglyphs had outline of that structure,
you know, 16 rooms, little squares.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they they had some very interesting
communication and to feel first that next
[SPEAKER_05]: near the creek that had some of these
petroglyphs had outline of that structure,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, 16 rooms, little squares.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they they had some very interesting
communication and to feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to be growing weed in the middle of
all that was very, very powerful.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we had a farm somewhere and just had 10
acres, it'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: But being surrounded by this and at night
hearing a creek flowing by and bears
[SPEAKER_05]: smashing through the bushes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the only thing that divides you
from the people who wrote those messages
[SPEAKER_03]: is time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, what a small barrier in some
ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And understanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And understanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to talk to you about one
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something that I feel like it
like I talk about it a lot, but I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: younger.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even in my generation, it was almost a
loss or unless you were into maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: tattooing or even plumbing or part of a
union job or something like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is apprenticeship, learning a craft
under someone, learning, learning the the
[SPEAKER_03]: apprenticeship apprentice meant apprentice
mentor role where you snap to it,
[SPEAKER_03]: do what you say, you know, because you're
learning and how that applies in modern
[SPEAKER_03]: days and how much of that is missing now
in your time when you wanted to learn to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were there guys that you could apprentice
under?
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you have found an apprentice in
the 70s?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say or 60s to learn to grow in 76
when my dealer friend from Tempe said,
[SPEAKER_05]: let's grow our own.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I already had a green thumb as far as I
worked on five acres of garlic with some
[SPEAKER_05]: other hippies in Cottonwood, Arizona.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love taking care of plants in my
yard, vines, anything that could make it
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I planted a few trees already.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I kind of knew soil culture a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Comfortable to step in then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I didn't know is anything about
the needs of cannabis as it grew and
[SPEAKER_05]: especially when to harvest it and how to
manicure it, how to dry it, manicure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was self taught with my friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had never grown either.
[SPEAKER_05]: And luckily we had the growers guides and
later marijuana botany and all these
[SPEAKER_05]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I frequently say the word.
[SPEAKER_05]: The written word has always been my guide
and my mentor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would buy books and books and books on
everything and just read and get ideas and
[SPEAKER_05]: ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't apprentice as a carpenter or
plumber or anything like that today.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, with the advent of more
artificial intelligence doing other
[SPEAKER_05]: things, really, if you can fix air
conditioners or heaters or plumbing or
[SPEAKER_05]: electricity or build things, you're not
going to have to worry until it's like
[SPEAKER_05]: George Jetson time and robots that can
walk around and do everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that that day is going to
come, but probably will.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe 50 years from now or 30 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're they're creating robots to fight
other humans, which is stupid or other
[SPEAKER_05]: robots.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, you know, being an apprentice to
a great mentor would be fabulous.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know people who have gone to work in
Colorado if they grows and learn the
[SPEAKER_05]: basics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And after a couple of years, they come
home and they they've learned what they
[SPEAKER_05]: needed to know to feel confident to do it
themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so.
[SPEAKER_05]: But jumping out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like you mentioned, if you're not
invested in it and you haven't put 10 or
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 years in, you you can always just quit,
like you mentioned, and walk away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas someone who's spent a whole lot of
years learning how to refinish furniture
[SPEAKER_05]: or build furniture or anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a nephew who's learning about
furniture right now, and he's refinishing
[SPEAKER_05]: it and starting from scratch.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think he has a teacher other
than.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe YouTube, you know, and that's that's
a legitimate method of learning now that
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't there when you're doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to change out my headlights
and my Tacoma because they're 10 years old
[SPEAKER_05]: and they they're fading.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've bought three cleaners to put on,
you know, and wipe the glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's polycarbonate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it works for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it goes back to being bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I looked online at a guy who shows how
to replace them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's like 10 different electrical
connections.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you could take a photo every time
you got to a certain spot, you're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: pull this one off and this take a photo.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you pull it out,
take a photo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I got to a dealer and paid them to
do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took them an hour and a half to put two
new ones in.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would have taken me two days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I made a mistake and then had to
troubleshoot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which wire did I leave off or put on the
wrong one?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it costs one hundred fifty dollars a
light to have them do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was worth every penny.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I bet those guys who did that in an
hour and a half, they apprenticed for many
[SPEAKER_05]: years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mechanics who can do stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in awe of I never need to get to that
level.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I changed my course.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ever did was change a starter in my
Volkswagen van.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did that myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt very proud.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to have a 66 bug and the idle pin
would always mess up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I learned that if I got duct tape and a
pencil eraser and put it on that idle pin,
[SPEAKER_03]: that it would fix it every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about the most auto mechanics I've
ever done is the old eraser.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You turn it on its head and found a
workaround, which I did, which I've seen
[SPEAKER_05]: some great mechanics back in the days that
could do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Duct tape, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And bailing wire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got to have bailing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you're off road and you hit that
muffler and it's hanging, you can strap it
[SPEAKER_05]: back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's also the idea and this kind of
goes along with the idea of a mentorship,
[SPEAKER_03]: apprenticeship, and it's becoming a part
of a group.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, when you become a part of a
forum, when the forum days were around and
[SPEAKER_03]: big, you know, I remember my first time
coming on the forums and trying to figure
[SPEAKER_03]: out how first, what am I?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do I say without looking stupid?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I integrate into this group?
[SPEAKER_03]: That I don't quite understand some of
these subcultures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was a punk rock kid in my area
growing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really relate to the deadhead
community very much, but that's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: this community is the hippie community.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got to learn to integrate and
communicate with people I've never really
[SPEAKER_03]: integrated with or communicated with or
understand their cultural subcultural
[SPEAKER_03]: level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't really seem to have that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we have are social media where you
just blast out whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but back then you had to
integrate yourself into a group to gain
[SPEAKER_03]: access, not even to gain access,
but to to learn from each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point, you know, to share,
then cuts were shared between the group
[SPEAKER_03]: because you trusted each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: You knew each other, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was over a period of several years
where a lot of these groups and
[SPEAKER_03]: friendships were formed and bound.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I talked to the guys today,
like in my in our Patreon Discord group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see how some guys try to assimilate,
you know, in some groups don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just it's very different than the
forum era where you where you watch these
[SPEAKER_03]: personalities kind of try to assimilate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas now it's just like lots of
clashing personalities all falling on top
[SPEAKER_03]: of each other and nobody really
understanding assimilation into groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very fascinating.
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean like ICMAG is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bunch of personalities all
screaming at each other as opposed to like
[SPEAKER_03]: a group working together.
[SPEAKER_03]: ICMAG had the great, you know,
SD's finest group.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: The San Diego's finest cuts on ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those guys did really good for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's so far and few between.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you have the land race groups on
ICMAG that all kind of pulled together,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have some good groups.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, yeah, you know, had a huge following.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tom Hill eventually got so fed up with all
these people hounding him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he he would just blast people.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was one of my early heroes of the
forums because he didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that he would just go off on
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was that he would do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was correct when he was saying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and he was a geneticist.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got off with the top of if he and Rob
Clark were sitting down or someone who
[SPEAKER_05]: really knew genetics well, he he would
have no difficulty, you know, talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about back crossing and just all the
different mathematical formulas involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you knew what how many would be this,
how many would be that way, what gene
[SPEAKER_05]: expressions would do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's beyond me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can kind of grab the concept.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm growing a hybrid and I have 10 of
those come up and I look at them,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll see differences in them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure I could scientifically say,
well, one quarter we're going to be this
[SPEAKER_05]: cross, you know, express these recessive
genes and go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to have conversations with him is
is very humbling on a breeder level.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go going back to the
apprenticeship.
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine being an apprentice petroglyph
artist in the Native American days or
[SPEAKER_05]: someone who made projectile points,
whether they were spear points for the
[SPEAKER_05]: paleo Indians 10,000 years ago to run up
and kill Buffalo or the archaic period
[SPEAKER_05]: that came next.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were adult adult points that were
look like large arrowheads and they would
[SPEAKER_05]: boost a spear throwers spear.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally, the bow and arrow showed
up in the southwest and little tiny
[SPEAKER_05]: points, which are sometimes called bird
points.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had to be very tiny and sharp and
lightweight because they're going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: shooting through the air on a stick.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you put a big point on their points
that that arrow would just go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those to find and to find their ancient
work on the ground when you're hiking is
[SPEAKER_05]: mind boggling to to know how long it would
take to be an apprentice and get skilled
[SPEAKER_05]: at making those when they had such a tough
life to live every day that they couldn't
[SPEAKER_05]: just take a whole day to make points
unless they were a special and they were
[SPEAKER_05]: so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe women, they they believe that
there was great women point makers,
[SPEAKER_05]: too, because they didn't go hunting as
much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were taking care of the home
front and they would have possible time,
[SPEAKER_05]: at least before the advent of people
growing crops and corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where you had to be out, you know,
taking care of the plants and stopping
[SPEAKER_05]: animals from eating them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've covered a lot of territory today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love petroglyph stuff, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was like it was like I was
connected with everything around me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, I just started
questioning everything I'd ever been told.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, by the time I got high,
that very first time when it started to
[SPEAKER_01]: hit me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got high.
