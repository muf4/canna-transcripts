[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_02]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_02]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_02]: seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_02]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Syndicate is a collection of seed makers
that want to push back against all the
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_02]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Matthew and I'm here today with Little
Hill Cultivators.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today we're going to be talking about not
just the legal scene, but some of his past
[SPEAKER_03]: in the cannabis world, like his whole
adventure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm real stoked to talk to him today.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been around a long time and welcome,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pleasure to meet you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long have you been growing and how did
this whole adventure get started?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think 02 was when I popped my first
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet Tooth number three.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in college and couldn't afford to
smoke weed as much as I wanted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happened upon Overgrow.com and kind of saw
the blueprint there.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people were real sketched out
early on when they found Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have any of those concerns at all?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It felt a little weird, but I didn't
register.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't post for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then eventually I just had some
burning questions I needed to ask and I
[SPEAKER_05]: got them answered.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was super, super helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very helpful tool for starting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's kind of how we all got our
little like people just kind of slowly
[SPEAKER_03]: step into the forums when they first get
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, do I really want to engage some
of these people are kind of brutal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, just who's looking at this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like 02.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like the internet's still kind of new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love looking at the pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the things that really drew
me there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you think about what kind of strains
were popular at the time when you were
[SPEAKER_03]: hitting Overgrow?
[SPEAKER_05]: The two that I remember the most are Sweet
Tooth number three from Breeder Steve and
[SPEAKER_05]: Cinderella 99 from Brothers Grimm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were very popular and everybody was
raving about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely at the tops of Spice of Life
and Brothers Grimm was very early too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and looking back on it, all that
Spice of Life stuff was great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big yielding frosty plants, great smells,
easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had some good stuff there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he really did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then later on with Legends too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever get me to try to do that
stuff?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I did grow LUI.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure I did grow that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's very similar to Sweet Tooth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a big center cola, mold prone,
big yielding, frosty, fruity smelling.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually, skipping ahead 20 years,
somebody showed me some Northern Lights
[SPEAKER_05]: five that you guys did.
[SPEAKER_05]: He flowered some out and the smells I was
getting off that Northern Lights was very
[SPEAKER_05]: reminiscent of Sweet Tooth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't smelled those smells in a long
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's whip it back around to how long
have you been kind of working inside the
[SPEAKER_03]: legal system of candidates?
[SPEAKER_05]: The legal part, let's see, California
passed Prop 64 in the end of 16.
[SPEAKER_05]: I voted no on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same.
[SPEAKER_05]: As most people did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then 17, the county came through with
structure to become legal within the
[SPEAKER_05]: county to become registered.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that kept the county off my back,
which was the biggest fear at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in 18, the state licensing thing
came online.
[SPEAKER_05]: So January 18, I submitted my application
and sort of bit the bullet and went for
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what have you been growing recently
during that time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you only have, with California's
medical scene, I know in a lot of other
[SPEAKER_03]: places you can only grow what they allow
you to grow inside their thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it work like that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the license, the county allowed me
for 10,000 square feet of flowering
[SPEAKER_05]: canopy, which was maybe a slight reduction
of what I had been doing previously.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had to change things around.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a big flat up on a hill.
[SPEAKER_05]: I basically abandoned and came down to the
valley floor.
[SPEAKER_05]: One, because I felt more comfortable kind
of being out in the open down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then two, it was just for regular
regulations and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was going to be easier to operate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus I have power down there and I did not
have power up on the hillside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it just made a lot of things easier.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kind of abandoned outdoor growing
and converted everything into greenhouses
[SPEAKER_05]: to light depth all my square footage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had always felt like light depth was the
future.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pulling off two crops, getting that first
crop out the door and kind of getting some
[SPEAKER_05]: revenue coming in instead of just
hemorrhaging money until God knows when
[SPEAKER_05]: you might actually get paid.
[SPEAKER_05]: The outdoor I usually just sat on for a
few months anyways after the season and
[SPEAKER_05]: having a big depth would allow you to do
that and not need to make a fire sale.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your thoughts on, Mike?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of random and candid,
but auto flowering versus light depth.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as being able to run those multiple
cycles, is one more advantageous than the
[SPEAKER_03]: other, you think?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can grow a wider range of what's
popular with light depth.
[SPEAKER_05]: With auto flower, I know they've come a
long way.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the outdoor license, you used to not
be able to pull tarp on outdoor license,
[SPEAKER_05]: but now you can.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have some elevation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be tough to pull off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't start very early outdoors and I
can't go very late outdoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: So trying to pull off two crops outdoors
without tarp, like maybe an auto flower
[SPEAKER_05]: crop in the spring summer and then replant
with something full term.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be tough for me to squeeze in.
[SPEAKER_03]: This all goes back to probably what we're
going to talk about in a little bit is
[SPEAKER_03]: market demand too, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's driving the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: If an auto flower might actually work,
it doesn't necessarily mean that it will
[SPEAKER_03]: work in the market, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The market's competitive, super
competitive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Growing from seed, you're going to have
some variation and figuring out which seed
[SPEAKER_05]: is good stuff to run and then getting a
ton of it because you're going to run high
[SPEAKER_05]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: When the price was higher and things were
not competitive, had I had an outdoor
[SPEAKER_05]: license, I definitely would have schemed
it up because then you can plant your
[SPEAKER_05]: autos and then in between your autos,
you can plant your full term stuff and get
[SPEAKER_05]: those in veg time early before you
actually chop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, what were we talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move into how you got started on the
floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the first thing that you did
before you started growing your crops?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's just from the bog stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So on overgrow, when I found it,
bog was posted like great pictures of the
[SPEAKER_05]: plants he was growing and he had these
long running threads of keep it simple,
[SPEAKER_05]: stupid, how to start growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: His methods were really simple and he
would chime in every now and then if you
[SPEAKER_05]: had a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I basically just copied his formula on my
first grow and it worked well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought some sweet tooth number three
seeds from Gypsy, but I forget what the
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds direct or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It did great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It grew great weed too.
[SPEAKER_05]: His formula was so simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just a rich soil mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blood meal, bone meal, lime, green sand,
kelp, warm castings, and then just using a
[SPEAKER_05]: pure blend original ferments.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, I grew great weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was outstanding and knowing what I know
now, I veered away from it over time and
[SPEAKER_05]: experimented with other stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And eventually came back to rich soil mix,
compost teas.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't do ferments, but I certainly will
be experimenting with that in the future
[SPEAKER_05]: because you can make them really cheap on
site.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That saves some money, but feeding the
microbes, having a rich soil and feeding
[SPEAKER_05]: the microbes just to me grows stellar pot
every time, even if you screw it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tough to beat.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tough to beat and at scale,
I don't like going to the store and
[SPEAKER_05]: spending tons of money on nutrients,
organic or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I feel like if I can just mix it into
my soil in the spring after a soil test
[SPEAKER_05]: and add water, that's ideal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I came in during a much different time.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as nutrients and the hydro store
boom and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I came in, I had to go through the
time of understanding that it was like a
[SPEAKER_03]: used car lot and the guys that work in the
hydro store aren't really growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to go through that bump and trying
to play magic magician with all the
[SPEAKER_03]: different nutrient bottles because I was
pretty sure one was going to finally make
[SPEAKER_03]: it more dank than the others.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's cool to hear someone that started
with something super simple and didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have to go through that crap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was the wisdom in Boggs thread
on his how to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, he started way before all
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kind of did too.
[SPEAKER_05]: There weren't a whole lot of options in 02
like there are now or like there were five
[SPEAKER_05]: years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know it's something I commonly see
with people, like something's wrong in
[SPEAKER_05]: their grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they think it's their nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, oh, it's not your nutrient
line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's some other variable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the same shit in those bottles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just marketing and company making
it for different pick one and dial it in
[SPEAKER_05]: and dial it in for the strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's not your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever's wrong in your thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's not the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: The nutrients are probably fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just figure it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I've been watching your
Instagram live feeds and I highly
[SPEAKER_03]: recommend other people like follow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at is it at little underscore hill
underscore cultivators?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: On Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been some of the more fascinating
content I've seen in a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I watch it every time you upload
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the other day you were
talking about specifically the legal
[SPEAKER_03]: market and not knowing exactly where your
flowers go or where direct people to get
[SPEAKER_03]: them or what name they'll be under.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was totally fascinating.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the way the legal market set up is
everything a cultivator cell has to move
[SPEAKER_05]: through distribution sort of like same as
alcohol in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of sort of sort of like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some exceptions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't sell direct to consumer or direct
to retail.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to move it through a distributor
who then sells it to another distributor
[SPEAKER_05]: or a brand that's a distributor or has a
license with a distributor and they sell
[SPEAKER_05]: it to retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I don't most of the time I don't
know where my flower ends up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who ends up buying it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what brand it's in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what stores it's in and that
disconnect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of time the distributor I move
it through doesn't know either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so like I'm kind of used to that since
back in the day you didn't really ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's like OK like people are hitting
me up like trying to find my flower or or
[SPEAKER_05]: they like my feed and they want to you
know support me or you know I actually
[SPEAKER_05]: grow good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like I've got also at the same
time I've gotten great feedback from the
[SPEAKER_05]: one store up here in NorCal that actually
attaches the farmer's name to the to the
[SPEAKER_05]: produce they buy organic and Mendo can.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Santa Rosa in Hoplan they are retail
but they also have distribution for
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're able to buy wholesale.
[SPEAKER_05]: They package it but they keep the farm
name and logo with the product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you're looking on their menu you
see all the farm names next to the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's that's super cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're one of the few places that do
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to me it's a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know like you don't just you don't you
don't walk into like a wine store and just
[SPEAKER_05]: buy cab or buy Merlot.
[SPEAKER_05]: You you see the vineyard or you see the
winery where it's made and the location
[SPEAKER_05]: and all those things about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and so that's a cool thing that they
do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just off of those three pounds I sell
them a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll get one or two people hit me up
saying hey man this was great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet you know and they appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm I'm stoked to hear that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think they're stoked to know that
they're actually talking to the grower and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not some like you know social media
sure you know person running running the
[SPEAKER_05]: social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That happens a lot too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean it's my operation is just me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean I have help but like it's it's just
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's there's no team in the sense that
like it's my business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and I mean I certainly have help on
the farm.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I couldn't do it without them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like there's no administrative
administrative office.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's my living room table.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's wild to me man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just felt we did an episode recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: We called the name game just about like
trying to explain to end level consumers
[SPEAKER_03]: that maybe aren't as nerdy about strains
and don't grow and aren't as dialed in to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we're doing trying to find
a way to reach across to them to for them
[SPEAKER_03]: to understand like look if you want to
know exactly what you're smoking and use
[SPEAKER_03]: its medicine you have to be a lot more
aware of what farms making it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need consistency.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need you know reliability and all of
that just all of that was so missing in
[SPEAKER_03]: what's going on right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know how they can rationalize
this as a medical system when there's
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing medical about not being able to
give repeatable reliable results.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's you can change the strain name any
time you want at any at any stage through
[SPEAKER_05]: the through the cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can a brand can be buying a strain and
run out and buy either if they can't
[SPEAKER_05]: source the same strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it was a good seller they'll just
throw something else in that bag under
[SPEAKER_05]: that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a brand like I don't know how that's
good business.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know and even if they do find the same
strain it's probably from a different
[SPEAKER_05]: grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then now there's varying qualities and
is it actually the same strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they think it's the same strain is one
you know grown inland is one grown coastal
[SPEAKER_05]: is one grown organic is one grown
differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they say like you know in the farm to
table type type atmosphere like know your
[SPEAKER_05]: grower like know where your food comes
from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well know where your weed comes from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's I mean I'm a farmer right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm super biased but like to me that's
a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I know where all my food comes from.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like I know where my meat comes from.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know where my eggs come from.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like the fact that I'm supporting my
neighbors with that as opposed to you know
[SPEAKER_05]: some asshole in Missouri.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or somewhere you know with a billion
dollars in a bunch of different companies
[SPEAKER_05]: that doesn't really give a shit besides
looking at the profit report.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had this experience of the day when we
bought some lily O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is when I was doing my little
experiment to see like if dispensaries in
[SPEAKER_03]: Bakersfield because you know Bakersfield
sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like this is the worst place in
California for weed ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no connoisseur quality
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wanted to see what dispensaries had
to offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: My lady liked the lily O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: we got.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it was a lily but it was a
good O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: So two days later called the same place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Deliver the same stuff again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a berry like a berry gorilla's move
this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's labeled lily O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so of course I hit them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like bro this is not even close to the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like yeah different phenotypes
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know like phenotypes speak to me bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's such horseshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah it's horrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean that's funny because Node Labs had
a picture of their O.G.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kush on their Instagram and the picture is
is is Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like yeah everybody knows it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I chimed in a bunch of other people I
know chimed in like dude that's Gorilla
[SPEAKER_05]: Glue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's it's obvious that's not an O.G.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah what do they know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's just some person on their social
media.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny as you mentioned weed shitty in
Bakersfield.
[SPEAKER_05]: For a while up here this was years and
years ago when you had a bag of not so
[SPEAKER_05]: great O.G.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The joke was to call it Bakersfield O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fucking great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or San Fernando Valley or whatever it was
like oh this looks like Bakersfield O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a it's a weird spot like people
not from California don't quite understand
[SPEAKER_03]: how lame Bakersfield is but it's a very
special special hole.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about some strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're talking about strain names.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to keep them stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about High and Lonesome's
Poodle Nest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this is one of your your classic
favorites.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah it's my all time favorite smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in like the 2010s and before maybe
the eights the seven six.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was mainly just growing a Purple Oracle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Grape Ape because that's what was
popular and I really liked the flavor of
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The high was not as good but like that's
what people wanted especially down in the
[SPEAKER_05]: Bay Area where I'm from.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I know it's kind of a bitch to
grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really slow veg.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the smell of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know it's nice and dense leafy but
dense.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got a hold of the Poodle Nuts from
from 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a 30 ounce.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had we had traded some cuts because we
were both down in the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he selected the Poodle right.
[SPEAKER_05]: He selected it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was an Urkel phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: He ended up running with like for
production another phenotype that was more
[SPEAKER_05]: that was a taller plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It probably was more Kim D related.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it might have still had some color
but the Poodle Nuts was an Urkel phenotype
[SPEAKER_05]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Squat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Purpleed up the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same branching leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The branching the larphiness in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_05]: The nug structure was different and it
just had it had that Urkel smell with the
[SPEAKER_05]: fuel which back then I just said it was
like Urkel with some spiciness to it
[SPEAKER_05]: because gas wasn't really a term people
threw around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was purple gas.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the first encounter with purple gas
I ever had.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean it it took over right away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like as soon as I started growing that
over a grape ape.
[SPEAKER_05]: It vegged a little faster.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a much prettier nug.
[SPEAKER_05]: The nug you know very swollen calyxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still leafy still squat but not as squat.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can stretch out a little bit more
if you tried.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to I want to a cannabis cup up and
humble with it with some indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Poodle nuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in like one in a landslide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know there was there was some good
weed up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I bet it just had everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just prettier than anything like
off right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just prettier than just any green
weed up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bet that helped.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was super tasty.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and people people took notice.
[SPEAKER_05]: We smoked so much weed that day you
couldn't tell high at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though I think I'm pretty sure it was
a that was one of the categories.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're taking like two puffs off of you
know 40 joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you just you can't tell high.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's all flavor bag appeal smell all
that stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it gets by the end of our party
sessions to every living when there's 60
[SPEAKER_03]: jars up there and it's over three days.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like at some point you stop
evaluating high because you're so fucked
[SPEAKER_03]: up all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah you just can't anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean if you smoke the right thing
you can cut through.
[SPEAKER_05]: But sure it's it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is few and far between on something
that'll cut through over a day long sash.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have another one or Betsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a old school one out of San Diego.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Bud Bud Euler up and humble sourced it
from Del Mar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grew it indoors and it was it was novel
you know really smelly unique structure
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of branchy purple stems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he gave it he gave it to CSI who grew
it outdoors one year and the next year it
[SPEAKER_05]: was half his garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then so so CSI passed it out to a few
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Including me he passed it to a few people
before I had an outdoor spot and I saw it
[SPEAKER_05]: catch on quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think I ran 10 beds of it on my
first outdoor year in a in a I think this
[SPEAKER_05]: was 11 and yeah 10 beds did great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was half my garden the next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good sign dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just such a unique strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could take three cuttings off it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take the tops like October 7th and then
give it two more weeks and then take like
[SPEAKER_05]: almost the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then wait for all although there
wasn't really lark.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just small buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were still dense though on the inside
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then let those go as long as you can
and they would purple up and then take
[SPEAKER_05]: those and they'd be smaller.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you mixed it into your other pounds
it gave your pounds some color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean back then people didn't really
grade too much and it kept its smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know by next April it still smelled
great in the bag when you were selling it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's that's unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of especially a lot of the hype the
more hype stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just it's not bred to do that or it's
not selected to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: No not at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not selected to sell now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Betsy's slowly making its way through more
current circles and it's fun to watch like
[SPEAKER_03]: growers from a different generation grow
her and like experience her and be like oh
[SPEAKER_03]: my god what is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know it's nothing like what we have.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a blast from the past.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably got a lot of skunk genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's it's almost definitely Dutch
origins right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I would think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean it's it's it's it's it's it was
a winner and it I mean it took over
[SPEAKER_05]: people's gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's how good it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like almost almost like as long as you
could sell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I sold it under mango kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because his name sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shitty name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is like like of course it's endearing
to people who know it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of the reasons it never caught
on was because of its name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's its sister to the cut bull rider
which totally caught on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean you have great with bull rider
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like using a fake bull rider to put on his
clothing store now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it still has some name value.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Betsy just never caught on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it definitely caught on in gardens up
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Up here Trinity Humboldt Butte.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's kind of funny if you if you meet
somebody who knows Betsy like it's not
[SPEAKER_05]: that hard to trace back to who we know in
common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh I bet.
[SPEAKER_05]: This happened to me last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like oh you know Betsy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's figure out who our common friend is
because you know the circles are kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tried explaining that to people too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a lot of how clone circles work and
how they've always worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you see people that aren't
necessarily connected to anyone pop up
[SPEAKER_03]: with a clone it's usually either
ill-gotten or fake just because of how
[SPEAKER_03]: tight those circles were and how well
everybody knew each other and how yeah how
[SPEAKER_03]: close people were to their words stuck to
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you knew that if it was making outside
the circle you're someone who probably
[SPEAKER_03]: stole it or it probably wasn't it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know if it's from a random outside the
circle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean in the circle people share pretty
freely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never hoarded genetics and if
somebody wanted it I'd do my best to get
[SPEAKER_05]: it to them because it's a it'd be a
benefit you know to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that surprises people the most is
when they come from outside to inside like
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the clone circles that they they
realize how open it is once they get
[SPEAKER_03]: inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like nobody's really like trading nobody's
really even caring.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like oh you want that cool here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's they assume it's a matter of
knowing somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're all being trusted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trust trusting somebody that OK I know I
know you I know you're not a cop and yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: or a shithead and and like I don't know
like I don't really know anybody that
[SPEAKER_05]: hordes clones for the most part.
[SPEAKER_05]: The people that do I know right away like
they're just on some other shit and they
[SPEAKER_05]: think I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why they think that their
clone is so special that oh I don't want
[SPEAKER_05]: this clone to get blown out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like dude like you're growing what a
couple hundred pounds of it maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's it's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like no one's going to experience it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody's going to hear of it or know it or
anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's no way the market's going to
get over saturated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now occasionally that can happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like look with like blue dream or train
wreck or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like I mean that that's few and far
between.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah that's a good point dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just you're you're going to be better off
openly sharing because then people openly
[SPEAKER_05]: share with you and you're going to have
access to more stuff and you'll benefit
[SPEAKER_05]: greatly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the same time you'll probably be
able to get those genetics back if you
[SPEAKER_05]: lose them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know the best advice I was given
in cannabis was our buddy CSI told me
[SPEAKER_03]: never tie yourself to one clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never get emotionally involved with one
clone because it leaves you stuck in a
[SPEAKER_03]: corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once that's out you're done.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have no moves.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was amazing advice because from all
the other angles they're like now you're
[SPEAKER_03]: emotionally tied to one thing and you sit
there obsessing over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the point of that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean it's also like things are so trendy
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: That if you're not open minded enough to
what's next or what's better and you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: think anything's better than this stuff
you have from 2005 like you're getting
[SPEAKER_05]: passed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're getting passed up you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even like the chances of what you
having being that great are not very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a few strains make a comeback like
Sour Diesel or OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to bring the poodle that's
back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been trying for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will get her back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been looking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've gotten some mislabeled cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I even got one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it was the real one or
not.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I lost it due to my own cloning
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was flattered out and I'm like oh shit
this is rainbow belts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like I made that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I got it back and I'm like oh
this isn't even poodle nuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is London pound cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I even bread with it and I'm like shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I got this whole breeding project
going on and I've got all this London
[SPEAKER_05]: pound cake S1 and cross to Kim D and.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did London pound cake express for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: What does she smell like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you know if it's a 75?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of fragrant and veg and it's
kind of squat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't notice right away.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it kind of just started smelling
more like gelato to me and it didn't have
[SPEAKER_05]: that Urkel and fuel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah it threw me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took a while for me to kind of like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Realize that it wasn't the real one and by
then everything's pollinated and yeah it's
[SPEAKER_05]: good weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like it's it's not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact I wish I hadn't lost it but I
basically just gave it up because I was
[SPEAKER_05]: pissed and didn't keep a mother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know but now I was real realizing like
oh man it's pretty good weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's funny dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah that's the other thing about poodle
nuts that I'll never forget.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Urkel has a similar trait where in veg
when you take cuts it smells very stunky
[SPEAKER_03]: in the room.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So poodle nuts was like seriously I could
be in my living room taking cuts and my
[SPEAKER_03]: chick in the bedroom be like give a stunk
walk in.
[SPEAKER_03]: People say talk about weed being stunky in
veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: That plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's anything more stunky
than poodle nuts in veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another plant that used to really smell
besides like Urkel was the genius cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh I never got to grow her.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah it was it was kind of a weak finicky
plant and lateral branching and cool
[SPEAKER_05]: unique nub structure and good skunky smell
to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great high.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was also very skunky in veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: CSI has mentioned that one a few times to
me over the years and I've never I wish I
[SPEAKER_05]: had made some seed with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly I don't have any more Apollo 11
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew Apollo 11 a few years a few times
and it was good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I wish I had more of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's part of my seed stash that got
lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew a lot of 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never never grew much 11 but 13 I grew a
ton.
[SPEAKER_05]: It probably wasn't too different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I don't I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was all a lot of grapy expressions on
big jack hair type buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No it wasn't great at all for me though.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Apollo 11 was just skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very weak stems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a great commercial plant but a pretty
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like not a huge stretcher but
still had a very narrow leaves.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So poodle nuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah I have some I had some old S1s from a
from a from a from a run from 2010 that
[SPEAKER_05]: I've kept in a bag in the fridge and I got
three to pop this year so I have I have
[SPEAKER_05]: three S1s growing outdoors right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all look very similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: The the tallest one of the bunch is is
very close to the original smell I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like the leaves are all green which is
unusual where the other two the leaves are
[SPEAKER_05]: starting to purple because you know it's
fall it's almost October and the temps are
[SPEAKER_05]: the temps are cooling off.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them doesn't really smell at all or
nothing close to what what I'm looking
[SPEAKER_05]: for.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then one of them is like very Urkel
kind of down there but it doesn't have the
[SPEAKER_05]: spiciness to it or the gas to it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean that's that's what I got out of
those.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have clones of all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to I'm definitely keeping them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have my plan next year is to run.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a bunch of hybrids of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason I wanted it back was to make a
sour diesel hybrid with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I had done that accidentally back
in the day and the one seed I got out of a
[SPEAKER_05]: sour diesel was just a diesel tall diesel
structured plant with purple flowers and
[SPEAKER_05]: that poodle nut smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a great potent high.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking the sour diesel helped the
high a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want that plant back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we only grew out one but you know my
buddy agreed that it was a good plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to make that cross again.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just crosses good to to to cushions to
O.G.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew some triangle to poodle nuts from
Sochi last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very impressed very impressed with how
well the smell carried over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The color didn't carry over the structure
didn't really carry over but the smell
[SPEAKER_05]: those turps were there in that in that
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me and me and high lonesome crossed it to
the blue body stuff we use which is like a
[SPEAKER_03]: really short squat blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it made for this beautiful blueberry
version of the poodle nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stuck to that structure and just
super blueberry berry turps on top of all
[SPEAKER_03]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well I have some of those seeds they're
going to get popped.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I gave you the last of high and
lonesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what it was is poodle nuts crossed
to poodle nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was poodle nuts to like a brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I made those.
[SPEAKER_03]: He made those a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope the pop they're old maybe never
knew he made those.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have bought some.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he only passed them to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there with you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are getting there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's the F fives of dog walks
that still exist here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those don't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have those.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then did high and lonesome make those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was just taking not the poodle
nuts but other lineage just.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to ask him.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it was used poodle nuts in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have to ask him maybe that might
just be open pollination.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well I'm popping a bunch of crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got it crossed to Kim 91 from Zochi.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got it crossed to north fire cookies for
that that old song raves about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What else do I have it crossed to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I'm missing a couple now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out old song.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out Zochi rest in peace.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a bummer.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was he was doing cool things that
reading company.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too bad he had to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of shocking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've done a lot of grows of modern
stuff too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously you're good friends of CSI.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk some about your experiences
with the skills and serve stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that's going to interest a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm growing out now.
[SPEAKER_05]: His skittles to Sherbert cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I've got 20 something females
going.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had one plant completely herm out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I killed it before before it blew
pollen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was it was very hermy very
surprising.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I heard me up the wazoo on that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was almost more male flowers than
female.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad I caught it anyways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's 20 something of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would all but to smell like Sherbert or
maybe all but three smell like Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then two of them are I would say the
bud structure looks very skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the smell is Sherbert various heights.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the shorter ones is definitely a
skittles phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then one of the medium height ones is
a skittles phenotype smell wise anyways.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then one of them is probably the most
pungent of the bunch.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like a Sherbert strawberry smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I of course I didn't have cuts to
that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went I went back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was last week and we took we
took cuts off the bottom and those those
[SPEAKER_05]: cuts off the bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have little flowers on them but they
will revert fairly quickly when after you
[SPEAKER_05]: root them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done that a bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually sometimes prefer it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because then that I mean that allows you
to wait for one and then like and not end
[SPEAKER_05]: up with this big veggie plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also like you can if you don't want to
take cuts off everything you can just wait
[SPEAKER_05]: for the smells you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took cuts of everything and pretty quick
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them are going to get cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see any skittles type stuff as far
as turps go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Off two of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a have a have skittles smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean for two out of out of my 18 20
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just so people know that's kind of a
range to expect even even in like skills
[SPEAKER_03]: as ones how dominant the actual really
really desirable turp is in a lot of those
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've noticed a lot of skittle crosses give
off like a strawberry scent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which isn't bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not skittles.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to me skittles is it's just one of the
best smells in cannabis period.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like an extreme.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like an extreme grapefruit to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grapefruit rinds is what I get from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also if you think like green skittles
sometimes that it's that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely like if I think of the old
sweet pink grapefruit clone now it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: that the extracts of that is what the
skittles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well I wish I had that cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew it once a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again a cool plant probably northern
lights really great smell to it funky
[SPEAKER_05]: structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I still had that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That just was that it had that real just
like skunky funk that that weed used to
[SPEAKER_05]: have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you don't see that at all really
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: No you don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's that's part of why
especially with prices being so low I feel
[SPEAKER_05]: like there is room to experiment a little
bit or also it's more important to
[SPEAKER_05]: experiment and do some phenol hunts even
though space is at a premium just because
[SPEAKER_05]: like you can't get stuck growing all this
same garbage that people think they want.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't show them something else
they're not going to know they like it
[SPEAKER_05]: more.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and and so it's that chicken or the
egg thing like why is everybody buying all
[SPEAKER_05]: this fucking purple gas garbage that that
the high is not that great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the flavor is just meh.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and it's like well that's all we're
growing right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're letting them demand the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Show them show them what good weed is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully you can find some that will
still test high enough to actually get
[SPEAKER_05]: bought in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's kind of like another barrier
as a lot of this old stuff won't test
[SPEAKER_05]: high.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again a lot of this old stuff
hasn't been tested with two thousand
[SPEAKER_05]: twenty three parameters which everything's
over 20 percent now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know bro all my blueberry stuff like
all that blueberry work I've done is all
[SPEAKER_03]: testing like twenty six twenty blueberry
test at twenty six or twenty eight bro in
[SPEAKER_03]: your life.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blueberries not super potent.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just what I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: All my blueberry even pure blueberry is
testing like twenty eight twenty five
[SPEAKER_03]: which maybe maybe the blue bonnet maybe
Lone Star work it's special which I think
[SPEAKER_03]: you did.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like that even still like being able
to take blueberry that high even in one
[SPEAKER_03]: move in an outcross still is not really
feasible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think a lot of these old lines if
they were tested under today's parameters
[SPEAKER_03]: might actually like really shock the shit
out of people where it has that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not because they're more potent now but
because everything tests higher now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lads have to put out good results or they
don't get business.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't ever get business from people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so dumb to be buying based off THC
percentage.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know people think they're getting a
better value but the reality is they're
[SPEAKER_05]: just getting shitty weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean that's that is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know it goes back to the education
part.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you get how do you get the end user
who are not growers to want to be
[SPEAKER_03]: interested enough to learn about like
maybe sativa indica and hybrid are not the
[SPEAKER_03]: best description to the high.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you like how do you explain that
like THC percentages are is like a seven
[SPEAKER_03]: 1970s 1980s thing that we've moved on from
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like yeah I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I think you just do the old free
sample like try it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Try this first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds obvious.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you can do things like tastings
or have events where you can like pass a
[SPEAKER_05]: joint to somebody like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how you get.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how you spread it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how you like help especially the
younger generation realize that you know
[SPEAKER_05]: what they think is that great is not that
great.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know and there's so much else out
there and there's there's such better
[SPEAKER_05]: highs out there and then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean so people maybe don't realize like
in 2000 say five to 2010 the only things
[SPEAKER_05]: testing over 20 percent were like OG and
chem dog.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like old SOG super silver haze will
get you absolutely ripped and it will cut
[SPEAKER_05]: through any other thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you're smoking you'll get
high all over again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's like 19 percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean even things like poodle nuts
which aren't never tested super high would
[SPEAKER_05]: test like 18 19.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I had it as high as 23 which for
that time period was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean I don't know what it would be now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would probably be you could probably
hit over 30 with it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think you could.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just buying off of like the numbers are
bullshit anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are you really buying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like people used to buy weed based off
smell because that was the best
[SPEAKER_05]: determining factor of the quality of the
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know the flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what gets the mouth watering.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know it's you know so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had a collective write me on IG the
other day and asked me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have one of your strengths here but
we were about to put it on the menu.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do I put it under indicates it's
either a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had I actually sat there all stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like let me have this discussion
with you kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know like it because it's you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like retail when when when clubs
dispensaries started opening they latched
[SPEAKER_05]: on because that was the general consensus
is that these narrow leaves are sativa and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like up euphoric busy speedy high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Indica's where these broadleafs
and their couch lock and then there's
[SPEAKER_05]: hybrids and they just latched on to that
because they wanted to sell the consumer a
[SPEAKER_05]: feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you need to tell them something.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like what do you want to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want like a daytime thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're trying to chill out at night and
they want to sell.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just want to sell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know something like it's a fact and
it's not a fact at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not even the taxonomy of the
plant has nothing to do with the chemicals
[SPEAKER_05]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even then I don't even think you can
tell chemically the difference between
[SPEAKER_05]: sativa and indica.
[SPEAKER_05]: I doubt it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't tell by terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean they can both have to really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gonna say even like we like to
trolley as the penalty.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that kind of raises that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean you know if you show these
people a real sativa or a real narrow leaf
[SPEAKER_05]: drug cultivar they would probably thumb
their noses at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's you know that's another discussion
about like the newer kids on IG that are
[SPEAKER_03]: like buying land races and stuff that you
know like they're going to buy some Indian
[SPEAKER_03]: land races and blah blah blah and you have
no clue that they don't even want to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: like this jungly thing you have to flower
as a seedling this big you know or it's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be 20 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's a lot of what you can call
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have the patience for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to get anything that
they're going to be able to sell to
[SPEAKER_05]: anybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to get made for very little
like spindly hairy weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they're going to just decide that
that's no good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And go you know go get purple purple gas.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean it's like there's no floral
structure really there and I don't think
[SPEAKER_03]: that they understand that there's blood
that even looks like that without full
[SPEAKER_03]: structures.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely a different thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And watching the new generation move in
and try to navigate the weird world of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis from the start is really really
funny to watch because I did it myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know exactly what they're going through.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made every idiot movie you could make.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're they're growing up thinking Sour
Diesel and Blue Dream or Sativa's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean Sativa I mean Blue Dream just based
on its genetics is 50 50 at best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For folks out there call call what you
think is an indica a broadleaf cultivar
[SPEAKER_05]: and call what you think is sativa a narrow
leaf drug cultivar and and leave the
[SPEAKER_05]: sativa in the in the indica stuff for you
know the chads.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean you got pins made a distillate with
with a sativa or indica label on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So trying to explain that to people too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's why there's no point even picking up
a distillate pen that says hybrid indica
[SPEAKER_03]: or sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there is no difference in any of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all it's all hybrids anyways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly people react different to
different terpings.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for some people most people most people
something broadleaf is really going to
[SPEAKER_05]: like be a couchlock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or have a more sedative high.
[SPEAKER_05]: But other people it's going to make them
get up and clean their house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know and it just it just reacts with
people differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's your body chemistry and what's
going on with you at that moment is going
[SPEAKER_05]: to react differently and set and setting
and find the same weed all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you find something you like you're
probably never going to see it again.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know like I learned this later on in
life because I was never a big psychedelic
[SPEAKER_03]: kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never really got into that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But learning about set and setting and
psychedelics and I never understood how
[SPEAKER_03]: people haven't applied that cannabis
because it's just there was set and
[SPEAKER_03]: setting the heroin.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're set and setting with all kinds of
drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did some studies where people would
overdose on the same amount of heroin if
[SPEAKER_03]: they were using it in a place they weren't
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So interesting versus their own home where
they're comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So setting is a major part of everything
whether it's cannabis or anything you're
[SPEAKER_03]: consuming.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know so I think that's where this
thing's left out quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like yeah absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like people get paranoia and anxiety
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's because of where you're at in
your headspace or maybe where you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like maybe you're not comfortable around
these people or maybe you have something
[SPEAKER_05]: on your mind that's that's wearing on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's not a good time to get loaded.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah yeah people overlook that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also like with with with increased
potency with with the way things are it's
[SPEAKER_05]: like don't smoke the whole joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just yeah take a puff see how you feel and
then go back to it you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to learn that myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know like going as a kid I would just
pop off like hard all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as an adult my hormones changed
like I there's times when my chick walks
[SPEAKER_03]: by she's like you just take a hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't like it's the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your first hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just take a hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do not need to smoke the whole bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like yeah it's certainly something I
learned that I couldn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was kind of more of a nighttime smoker
anyways when I was a heavy smoker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless there was like some social function
where we're smoking during the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I kind of learned especially as I
started growing more and more weed and
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of put my ass out there a little bit
more before legalization that it's instead
[SPEAKER_05]: of like relieving all anxiety it started
amplifying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then so I barely even smoke for a few
years because I just wasn't enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when I would smoke I had no
tolerance and I'd get ripped.
[SPEAKER_05]: And paranoid and feel uncomfortable for 15
minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it wasn't fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then as time went on I kind of learned
set and setting or I just call it time and
[SPEAKER_05]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's certain activities that I
know will be enhanced and better if I
[SPEAKER_05]: smoke out first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like before I go on a mountain bike ride
or before I clean my house or before I got
[SPEAKER_05]: a bunch of like monotonous work to do in
the greenhouse where it's hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great time because you just put
on some music and you zone out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't really have to think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just get to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's the same thing like when you're
like I used to trail run.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great for that because you don't
you're in your head just thinking about
[SPEAKER_05]: other stuff besides how tired you are how
far away from the car you are or whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: else is going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of a sudden like you realize oh my
lungs aren't burning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I could yeah I could do another mile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's for me that's that's where it
really works.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's and I spoke more now because I
know when are the right times.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's super important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that's something I had to learn
myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I know if I'm having a super bad like
stressful day that it's probably like a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of people use it to release stress
when they're having a bad day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it will spin me out and put me in a
bad black hole no matter what.
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter if I'm like because I dab all
day like even as we're sitting here I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: dabbing and it doesn't really affect me or
make me too paranoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's certain times where if I'm in
a real bad mood and I dab to the moon just
[SPEAKER_03]: like not anywhere good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I need back rubs please.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in that sense it is a medicine and
we're kind of using it medicinally to
[SPEAKER_05]: improve things but also like knowing when
not to not cure all.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I figured out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I'm super annoyed over something
it's actually good to smoke out because
[SPEAKER_05]: then I just kind of stop dwelling on it
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and you know I just kind of move on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know now he's so opposite throw like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me hyper obsessed when I'm like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh it's worse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people just got to figure it out for
themselves and it's not for everybody
[SPEAKER_05]: either.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for most people that figure it out it
enhances their life greatly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very specific especially for me this
whole journey like I've had a love hate
[SPEAKER_03]: relationship at some point with cannabis
because it's put me in such bad mental
[SPEAKER_03]: zones.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once you figure that out the set and
setting part the time and place it's it's
[SPEAKER_03]: it does change a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you realize it's not one it's not a
cure all and it shouldn't be a cure all it
[SPEAKER_03]: shouldn't fix all of your moods.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not weird if it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've been going a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a specific TKS one that you like
a lot or have you been going a bunch.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have one I got from Roots nursery.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny when you talk to people on the
legal side and if you can establish that
[SPEAKER_05]: they're from the old days like there's so
much cooler and there's more passion and
[SPEAKER_05]: they actually know what they're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that these guys were absolutely that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we just talked about tons of shit
and he grew out I think he only grew out a
[SPEAKER_05]: pack of S ones but he selected a good TKS
one and it's a very much O.G.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know how T.K.
[SPEAKER_05]: it is on that spectrum where like T.K.
[SPEAKER_05]: is on the earthy side and like SFV is on
the on the pine soul side.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a little early for it to really
tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's I've seen it indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it grown out indoors and it's
just O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so yeah I'm I'm stoked to be growing
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to grow it again next year for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's my favorite side of T.K.
[SPEAKER_03]: personal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah yeah I I was always fond of SFV like
any to me but to me like any well grown T
[SPEAKER_05]: .K.
[SPEAKER_05]: or any well grown O.G.
[SPEAKER_05]: is super dank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah I don't care which one it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to enjoy it like 100 percent
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's grown well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's yeah that's you know that's
that's all I really care about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And does it check the box and is it grown
well if it's grown well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well it's super dank and people that have
never smoked it are just going to be blown
[SPEAKER_05]: away.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and I'm growing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm growing it again because I stopped
growing it just like everybody else for a
[SPEAKER_05]: long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you realize that like you know
I'm guilty of following the hype too.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just because I'm a commercial
cultivator I got to grow what people want
[SPEAKER_05]: even if it's not as good as what else I
could grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I got away from growing O.G.
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of people are growing them again now
because they're realizing like you know
[SPEAKER_05]: this this fucking carbon fiber or whatever
is fucking great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know and and so like you know the
price is the same either way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'm growing fucking O.G.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to grow some good smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to grow something that like maybe
you know somebody associates with my name
[SPEAKER_05]: at some point and and and and just
realizes that like holy shit like O.G.
[SPEAKER_05]: still king for a reason you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or one of the kings.
[SPEAKER_03]: For this season I've been getting asked
more from actually honestly not even from
[SPEAKER_03]: seed buyers from breeders and other
growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey did you keep any O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: cuts bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because nobody kept them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody fucking kept them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody kept them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't fucking believe O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: is rare now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well it's rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and and and it's and it's tough to
source stuff that nobody has anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not not just because but like it's hard to
find the person with it but like
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody's going to bullshit you at some
point and just give you a cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think I source the SFV from these
same guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were skeptical as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they they first they tested it for for
hoplite and viroid and that's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then now they're they're flowering it
out next to the TKS one to see is this
[SPEAKER_05]: really SFV what's going on with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're they're skeptical as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're not releasing it till they know
what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you source SFV too?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a good conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh I didn't see.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even ask them where they got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt like that wasn't any of my
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would just let them kind of do their
thing.
But.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with SFV where would you source it to?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's the original source for SFV?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who brought that online?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who brought that exactly?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's not Josh D.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean at this point it was spread around
so much that like you could have
[SPEAKER_05]: legitimate SFV and not know like really
where it came from at one point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody had it at one point.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that it's disappeared like pretty well
disappeared as far as like this cut SFV.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one person who brought it to the
table and held it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's never been that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now that it's kind of like me and CSI
were talking about this specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to get your opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how do you how do you even go about
sourcing an SFV?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who would you go back to?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wouldn't go to Josh D.
[SPEAKER_03]: for SFV because his cut was never called
SFV.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone else named.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know either.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would have to be somebody from Southern
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who put that moniker on it
and I don't know that there even was one
[SPEAKER_05]: SFV.
[SPEAKER_05]: There could have been multiple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know people people would really
get nitpicky with what's oh that's a good
[SPEAKER_05]: one or that's not a good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like dude like if you grow it well
like it's a good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't grow it well like OK OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh I don't like SFV.
[SPEAKER_05]: The SFV I saw was garbage and now SFV is
garbage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just saw some Bakersfield OGs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have Bakersfield OG bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah you know yeah you don't you don't
know the seed line didn't help.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know he released it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on out and then Darkheart Nursery
started selling SFV and I asked them
[SPEAKER_05]: myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't fucking know.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just employees that don't fucking
care.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they would use the description of
swerves.
[SPEAKER_05]: To on their SFV and I was like y'all
don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did y'all grow this from seed or did you
source a cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like just fucking tell me like they
wouldn't even know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody fucking knows anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody there knows anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know they're really good employees.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah they didn't want to get fucking
peppered with questions from a grower
[SPEAKER_05]: who's fucking anal about that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: No no.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that's the hard part with a lot
about with a lot of these nurseries is
[SPEAKER_03]: that you'll find out like you go to them
and these are people who are supposed to
[SPEAKER_03]: be holding the clones and like libraries
for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't give a fuck about genetics at
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like when you're talking about this
nursery you're working with that they were
[SPEAKER_03]: cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they called?
[SPEAKER_05]: Roots Nursery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Roots Nursery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's a rarity to find like a legit
person running that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super rarity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm shouting them out to maybe throw
them some business honestly because I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't want these guys to disappear.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're they're doing good stuff and they
have good cuts and they're doing they're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing phenoselections.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing breeding but they're also
holding some of that older stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So so and they know what they're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're they've been around.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just half hour on with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on to the Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about this bad girl.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a bunch of seedlings from CSI in
2019 to flower out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got I think he gave me one hundred and
twenty but I think we ended up flowering
[SPEAKER_05]: out a hundred and eleven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for whatever reason maybe some didn't
make it or maybe they were just runty and
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't want to bother because runs
weren't going to runs weren't going to
[SPEAKER_05]: make the cut anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not for what I was selecting for.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know there there were some shorter
plants that had great noses on them from
[SPEAKER_05]: the from the T one thousand.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what Phoenix is is T one thousand
to TK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a T K back cross and I mean it's
really cool looking through that many
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never looked through a hundred a
hundred plants before from the same from
[SPEAKER_05]: the same line just to see the spread and
then and like you could put them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the plants would either be like
green or G types or like would have purple
[SPEAKER_05]: leaves but still green bud and be and have
more of that musky or cookies scent but
[SPEAKER_05]: they would look like cookies crosses as
opposed to just your cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the Phoenix is from that group and
then the outliers were like one plant that
[SPEAKER_05]: looked absolutely like cookies like
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you scroll down my feed to 2019 there's
a bunch of pictures of it really pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: really really frosty.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of a it was kind of a short
not very vigorous plant though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I doubt CSI has a cut of it anymore but
but that's the one he wanted from me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's yeah like a couple T one
thousand phenotypes which were shorter but
[SPEAKER_05]: like had great turps on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: The bud was kind of leafy but like so this
this one that I selected it had it was
[SPEAKER_05]: extremely vigorous top 10 percent vigor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great calyx to leaf ratio.
[SPEAKER_05]: The bud didn't really purple up like it
can a little bit and I'm sure indoors it
[SPEAKER_05]: would be easier to manipulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But but even even even grown out late in
the fall like you might get some calyxes
[SPEAKER_05]: near the stem to to purple up but it
doesn't really want to purple up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's it's got good potency.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got good yield vigor like I said.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the main thing I was looking for
is like I want something with like big OG
[SPEAKER_05]: structure and good yielding but I want
some of that burkle turps in in that
[SPEAKER_05]: flower in the flavor of it and it and it's
the only one out of all of them that had
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So so that's why that's why I selected it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I've kept it and I passed it to
CSI's brother and they grew it out last
[SPEAKER_05]: year and they're keeping it and they're
still running it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which speaks a lot which like you got to
give it to other people because like it's
[SPEAKER_05]: my baby but like you give it to somebody
else and see what they think about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know does it stay in their garden or
not.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how good is it really.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you're super biased and that's why
you totally passed it out like hey I think
[SPEAKER_05]: I got something good here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know like I don't I don't want to pass
on something that's bunk you know but I
[SPEAKER_05]: think it's good but like I also understand
my own bias towards it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just I'm I'm growing a bunch of it
outdoors right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's looking and smelling great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait to smoke some.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more flavorful than your traditional
TK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's got those Urkel turps to it
but it's got the TK potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is a tough thing to kind of try to
match up for some reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: Urkel turps just mean low potency or or
sort of that more like lethargic high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean look at cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a to me in my opinion like some kind
of O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: Urkel hybrid like right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you're seeing and there's not a
lot of people like people don't brag about
[SPEAKER_03]: screaming potency in cookies but it's like
they're taking it one direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a chance to take it a better
direction with more turps and better
[SPEAKER_03]: potency.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not it's not a pretty a plant as
cookies is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more traditional looking but it's got
a really good calyx to leaf.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean that that alone just kind of
makes it and it and it I've grown it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've grown it indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've grown it in a very climate controlled
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've grown it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've kept it in the middle of summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's different in all in all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks different.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it it might check all the boxes
depending on how you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean it's it was really pretty grown in
my climate controlled greenhouse and grown
[SPEAKER_05]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a little bit more trouble trying to
get it to yield there for some reason and
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure why yet but outdoors or in a
depth.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's chunky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have let's see what's the next
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh one more thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I called it Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_05]: I called it Phoenix because it's the only
mother I kept through the twenty twenty
[SPEAKER_05]: fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: My whole place fire ran through my whole
place and and I lost some structures.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lost the crop for the most part and it
was a it was a very hectic fall that year
[SPEAKER_05]: to say the least and I'm still barely I'm
still struggling to recover from it
[SPEAKER_05]: honestly but that's why I called it the
Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_05]: It needed a name.
[SPEAKER_05]: The the the back cross didn't really have
a name.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was calling it back to the triangle for
a while which which I thought was a good
[SPEAKER_05]: name.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Caleb came up with that though.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I've just decided to call it
Phoenix and yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what he does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's memorable.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll show some love to heart attack.
[SPEAKER_05]: Heart attack Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's from 707 Seed Bank before he
wasn't even was 707 Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's it's a Kush cleaner phenotype
which is a OG to Jack's cleaner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jack a Jack cleaner back cross mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the back cross mail.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a back cross mail that Loran
originally did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was using that mail and then he
gave the mail to 707 Seed Bank and because
[SPEAKER_05]: he loved it so much and he made a **** ton
of the same cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this heart attack Fino was just like
one out of ten to one out of twenty would
[SPEAKER_05]: be this early flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a little shorter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very frosty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jack Terps with like some like puke smell
on the back end.
[SPEAKER_05]: And not not the not the best flower like
it could get really larfy in the middle
[SPEAKER_05]: but it was early and that was that's
that's why it it it appeals to me is you
[SPEAKER_05]: know back when I run an outdoor I I had my
garden like basically four strains and I
[SPEAKER_05]: would start with like early you know
middle late.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the harvest was always staggered and
coming in because you only have limited
[SPEAKER_05]: dry space.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, that was one of my earlys along
with purple rec and yeah, I I grew the
[SPEAKER_05]: **** out of it for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Luckily, my buyer didn't mind the the the
Jack Terps but which I know a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: buyers just would thumb their noses at for
a while for sure and yeah, I think I think
[SPEAKER_05]: that's changed especially on the legal
side.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm sure you know these Terps come
and go and trends come and go and I think
[SPEAKER_05]: that a lot of people haven't really had a
good and it's like a pretty bud too
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's so frosty.
[SPEAKER_05]: So and it's good smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tasty.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's got a great high good potency.
[SPEAKER_05]: It also washes really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I think I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'll make a comeback.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm gonna do a I'm gonna do a little
Fino hunt next year of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: With some uh I made I made F twos with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I took a few Kush cleaner uh males and
and crossed into the heart attack cut that
[SPEAKER_05]: I was that I was using and it's it's based
on the actual F two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, is it the actual F here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I because I use that one female I
wanted, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and then just multiple males just to
you know, get everything in the mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there was one you just mentioned and
we almost forgot and that's the purple
[SPEAKER_03]: rack which is uh absolutely one of my
favorites of all time for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Purple rack was also really early.
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny story about that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also got that from forty ounce.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um I think I got it at the same time I got
the the poodle nuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: He bought the seeds from from DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um it was the Reserva Provada line which.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I came out with mine was just seeds they
bought from guys up here in Norcal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh one of my one of my friends up here uh
he accidentally seeded his garden one year
[SPEAKER_05]: because he missed a male and uh I forget
what line that was.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like I wanna say it was like old
time or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe the sweet tooth or god, I don't
remember which line it was but he sold
[SPEAKER_05]: them all that seed and they bought it out
as I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't was whatever that you could
probably find it in the in their old
[SPEAKER_05]: cattle catalog or something uh whatever
that line was but then so I get this and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like it's great weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like it's like train rack on a on a
shorter plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh still purples up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, really good yielder like
absolutely chunky.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um super dense buds but still dense but
like a train rack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Structure to the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and still had rubbery stems.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just a shorter plant and uh you
know, I'm I'm showing some jars to at a
[SPEAKER_05]: friend's house in Humboldt one day and and
uh I probably had the poodle nuts with me
[SPEAKER_05]: and I forget what else I had but maybe
some sour diesel and I showed him this
[SPEAKER_05]: purple rack and we're just talking about
it and he's like, oh yeah, I I made these
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, he uh he made a couple of crosses and
sold them to DNA and then like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I circle back around.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even know this person at the time
and yeah and then now now he's a really
[SPEAKER_05]: good friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: And uh I brought him from the seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: He wait.
[SPEAKER_05]: He never found a phenotype like that when
he popped the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that was like **** This is the one I
was looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it gained a lot of popularity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um it got brought out to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was popular there for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a buddy in Hoplin grow it for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um uh I grew it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew it outdoors for a long time just
because it was it was early.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was heavy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um it kept its smell, you know,
you know, until well into the next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um the high was meh.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's kind of you know,
but other than that, like it it checked
[SPEAKER_05]: every other box like huge yields or huge
yield potential early.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just that's just all that's winners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh purple wreck was one of the first
purple uh strains I could smoke or it
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't give me any pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would give me paranoia instantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Urkel was always one of the
ones that got me so bad every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still live.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like this one was like eight twenty
percent Urkel and like mostly train wreck
[SPEAKER_05]: but you can kind of taste and smell the
Urkel like on the back end which just kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of nice about it and I mean I love train
wreck back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one of the reasons I wanted to
start growing and so I could grow my own
[SPEAKER_05]: train wreck and yeah of course I couldn't
get a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course not.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean and then and then once I did,
I grew it out once and it was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh, this is great and then I got an Urkel
cut and I'm like onto the next one.
[SPEAKER_03]: After the big hunt, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: After finally tracking it down after many
years, I grew I grew some S ones out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew some hybrids from uh from Jojo
Rizzo and they were good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew his S ones out.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um his uh sour diesel crystal locomotive
was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um I don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I did grow crystal locomotive too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just pure and that was also really frosty.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just wasn't train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um but those S ones were train wreck for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This locomotive is shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally underrated strength back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had some of those seeds in my lost seed
stash as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still got some in the fridge from a
friend.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ever want to run them?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we can talk about something maybe
more modern that's in your garden which is
[SPEAKER_03]: the uh mochi runs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to talk about that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mochi runs is just a shot in the dark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh strain I bought from a nursery.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh just clones I bought from a nursery.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um just wanting to run something that kind
of like was what the market was wanting
[SPEAKER_05]: which is candy gas and uh I was I was
pleasantly surprised with how well it
[SPEAKER_05]: grew.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of vigor, a tall plant, really
really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really frosty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um great.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, has that runt smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um I don't know who bred it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um I don't even know if if if if that
nursery selected it or not but just just a
[SPEAKER_05]: just a great plant for what the market
wants right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a great for a grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And runs is fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not super into growing runs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really want to grow runs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um but this plant just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the things that runs is but like
without the headache of a of a kind of a
[SPEAKER_05]: finicky plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one nice thing about runs is it
doesn't want a lot of food and I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: feed a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, I don't push my plants very hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um you know, I feel like that's one of the
ways just to fuck up the flavor of it and.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely one of the ways you can
get light yields too if you don't if you
[SPEAKER_05]: don't have it dialed in but.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh it yeah it's got that it's not super
it's not super hungry like uh like like
[SPEAKER_05]: well I mean a runs plant is not super
hungry so I I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the some of the purples can be
like you know food hogs and and uh I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: know just just good weed and honestly I
don't know what's mochi about it or I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't know nothing about it just a shot in
the dark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, who knows, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think uh it's supposed to be a mochi
gelato cross to runs if I remember
[SPEAKER_03]: correctly but.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what any of that means.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's probably that's I mean it
probably is what it is but.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be ice cream cake to runs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get into some philosophical
stuff here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um what's Heddy's for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh and and how much you've got some
Heddy's and how much do you grow for
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself and for your own taste?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you've talked a little bit about
this but like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heddy's for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, I know I got some Heddy's from Old
Sog this winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: He he grew some destroyer out which is
like I think it's Thai Columbian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's uh meow Thai.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He sent me a a bunch of different
phenotypes and one of them, the number
[SPEAKER_05]: five was just a fucking head ringer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um absolute head ringer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Head and shoulders more potent than than
than all the other phenotypes he sent me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was that's what I will call some
Heddy's.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um for myself, like I grow especially this
year, I'm growing way too many strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'll just snag what I like the most.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um so, I mean, this year, it's definitely
gonna be those Poodle Nuts S1s.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely gonna be some of the
Skittles, uh phenotypes from the Skittle
[SPEAKER_05]: Sherb but I'll keep some Sherb as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um Mochi Runs for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh Phoenix for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just basically, I like, I like
smoking flavorful stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care about potency as much because
it all gets behind if I'll just smoke more
[SPEAKER_05]: if I if I need to get more stone like I'll
smoke Mendo Perps all day and I'll just
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just smoke twice as much,
you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um because Mendo Perps isn't potent but.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super flavorful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um so, yeah, those um what else am I gonna
keep?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, definitely the OGs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got I got two different OGs from 707
Seed Bank that he collected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um one's the 707 OG which is a a three
back cross to to SFV I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll definitely be keeping some of
those for the head and the 707 Kush which
[SPEAKER_05]: is OG to is Kush for back cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll definitely be keeping those.
[SPEAKER_05]: He says that one in particular.
[SPEAKER_05]: Motorcycle driving by.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He says he says that one in particular is
a a serious head ringer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'll definitely keep some of that when
I'm trying to impress some friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh what else do I have going?
[SPEAKER_05]: But I really wanna.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I have some actual Skittles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pure Skittles going too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll definitely be keeping a few jars of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um if well done Skittles is just so tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like the tastiest weed that that's
that's what's in my jars for the most
[SPEAKER_05]: part.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you're like trying to
understand what something is I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but like if I don't like it,
I'm not even gonna get through the jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm with you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Heddy's Heddy's is different for
everyone and I I think it just tends to be
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever gets you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes the edge off that you like the
most.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever edge you need to be taken off.
[SPEAKER_03]: That you like the most and it sounds like
even though you grow for the market,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're still growing stuff that suits what
you love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I I find that like bulk for market
but you can still get off the stuff that's
[SPEAKER_05]: good that maybe isn't gonna check that box
of super high THC with the strain
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody wants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, some people's Heddy's has to
be potent because they smoke a lot and and
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally get that but you know,
I'm a time and place smoker so it it
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't so I can and I like smoking tasty
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you ever smoke extracts or anything
like that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so much anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't I don't make them either anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, no, I don't dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: I stopped dabbing a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just my tolerance is not that high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, dabbing just, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't really affect my tolerance of
flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why but it's so weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I get so much more high off flowers
than I do off dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wired so **** weird, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I I will hit a live rosin pin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, it's for the flavor and and
rosin pins just happen to be super
[SPEAKER_05]: convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like II know a couple people that make
them and I and I know, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I they're using good flour in their
process and I'm there's no **** and you
[SPEAKER_05]: know, they're they're just hustlers on the
traditional side and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They make a really really good product and
I go into a store like I wouldn't even I
[SPEAKER_05]: wouldn't trust, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever they say it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't know if it's that,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's not something I've been
learning myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those rosin pins, the disposable ones are
great and yeah, I just I always have one
[SPEAKER_05]: from a friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I've ever tried a rosin pin
yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's it's just it's just super
flavorful.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's what I'm looking for when
I'm getting high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like have it taste good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want that taste to be natural,
not some **** you know in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I want to taste what this weed smells
like, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the added turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no added turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no added anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, clean.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, it's like, you know,
it's my neighbor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like, I'm supporting them over some
**** company, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that matters to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a philosophical topic that I'm
really interested in with the the breeder
[SPEAKER_03]: syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of what I've been trying to do is a
a group based effort to kind of push back
[SPEAKER_03]: on kind of everything going on in a push
of education.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you've talked a lot about like the
difference between unions and co-ops.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe is what the way you had worded
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk a little bit more about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's like something I'm super
interested in and I don't really know the
[SPEAKER_03]: definition between the difference between
union co-op.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, I'm talking co-ops and people
say unions sometime.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like growers need a union.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, no, we need a co-op.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unions for labor, for for labor to
organize and get better rates and get
[SPEAKER_05]: treated better.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm all for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, businesses take
advantage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if they have a monopoly on the
employment or if they collude with each
[SPEAKER_05]: other, you know, to keep your wages low to
to enrich themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Co-ops is for producers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Small, mainly small producers.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, it could be big producers.
[SPEAKER_05]: But really, we're talking small producers
that can't afford to market themselves,
[SPEAKER_05]: can't afford to capture these economies of
scale that the big boys have.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, Sunkiss did this with orange
growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ocean Spray did this with cranberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Ocean Spray, that name that
everybody knows because like you think
[SPEAKER_05]: Ocean Spray, you think cranberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cranberry growers like probably up in
New England or somewhere started it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just a brand they started.
[SPEAKER_05]: And collectively, you know, they're
selling their cranberries through this
[SPEAKER_05]: brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're licensing the name that maybe some
other company buys their cranberries
[SPEAKER_05]: through the co-op.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they license the brand,
the Ocean Spray name.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you want to make juice with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to make sauce with them or
whatever the case may be.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of value in that name.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those growers are negotiating better
prices because now that co-op is one of
[SPEAKER_05]: the big players collectively made up of
many small farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, together, they're one of the major
players.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you did the same thing with
cannabis and took all the 10,000 square
[SPEAKER_05]: foot farms up here, you'd have,
I don't know how many acres, 80 acres of
[SPEAKER_05]: canopy space, which is a ton of weed to
make us one of the biggest players in
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd have them collectively marketing and
creating brands for all that product to
[SPEAKER_05]: flow through.
[SPEAKER_05]: And since the growers own the brand,
they capture that added value.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now they're not selling wholesale or
they are selling wholesale to the co-op,
[SPEAKER_05]: but then they have equity in the brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they capture it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the markups, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's really what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like individually, we can't afford to hit
every store and try and sell our product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the cost of marketing,
the cost of sales, the cost of packaging,
[SPEAKER_05]: all those things can be combined.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everybody pays a little piece and then
we capture all the value.
[SPEAKER_05]: And ideally it's a big enough company that
it could even vertically integrate at some
[SPEAKER_05]: point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And instead of striking distribution deals
and extract deals and edible deals and all
[SPEAKER_05]: these things, we could all just do it
in-house or we like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's our brand, which would be the only
authentic brand in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, flow cannot try to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They tried to co-op the image of the small
farmer for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they did.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of the day, all they cared
about was raising a bunch of money to get
[SPEAKER_05]: to tell investors, look at all this weed
we're going to get from these guys,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and look how much product we're
going to move and give us these
[SPEAKER_05]: investments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're great at doing that,
but what they were shitty at was selling
[SPEAKER_05]: weed and treating the farmer right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So rather than just co-opting an image,
like we are what we say we are.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not an image.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's us.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so we'd be the only authentic
brand in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, there's dairies that do this too,
like Tillamook.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you know, let us all do this
in-house and let these small farmers that
[SPEAKER_05]: are forced to sell wholesale and barely,
I mean, you're either barely making it or
[SPEAKER_05]: you're slowly dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I could get a hundred more dollars
a pound at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it be through, you know,
some type of dividend at the end of the
[SPEAKER_05]: year or however it would work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that, that makes it all happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm making a living.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's just farming.
[SPEAKER_05]: The margins are tight.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're probably going to, they're going
to be tight forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and it's tough to do selling
wholesale and competing on wholesale
[SPEAKER_05]: prices with the glass houses that are just
putting out thousands of pounds a month.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's terrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it drives the price down on everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's their fucking business plan
is to drive the price down so low and just
[SPEAKER_03]: take losses.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can afford money because they've got
all this investor money to, to collapse
[SPEAKER_05]: the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then hopefully they want to be the
last one standing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they're the last one standing and
all these small farms up here,
[SPEAKER_05]: go out of business, these towns go out of
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole economy up here goes out of
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your, your friends, everybody's in the
weed business up here in some aspect,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's, you're an accountant working
for a bunch of growers or hell,
[SPEAKER_05]: even the fucking police, you know,
grows, what are they going to do with all
[SPEAKER_05]: their time?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the most of their families are
involved in the grows.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I mean, their families are involved
in the grows.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been making a living robbing
growers for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're funding.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's no, if they don't get plant
counts and they're going to lose their
[SPEAKER_05]: budgets and which means they're going to
have to cut jobs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I hope they do lose their jobs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to stay in business.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, you know, the whole economy
is tied up with this thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you go down main street by
Garberville or Hayford, these towns that
[SPEAKER_05]: are like a hundred percent pot for the
most part, 90%, there's no tourism.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no really other viable industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe logging a little bit, but.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, it's just a bunch of
shuttered businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that means that that many less jobs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the people that worked at that
restaurant, you know, the, the,
[SPEAKER_05]: the 15 people it employed, they don't have
jobs now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's up in North tower right
now, like Trinity Humboldt Mendo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is it looking, can you visually see
places closing down?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you can see a whole strip in a
building of all the businesses are,
[SPEAKER_05]: are shuttered.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're, they're done.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a result of the weed market.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a result of the collapse of the weed
market.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, these are, these are businesses
that technically have nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_05]: weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, of course the growth stores have all
consolidated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's only a few bigger ones left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, which is, is fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it was bigger go home because for a
while, like everybody wanted to open a
[SPEAKER_05]: growth store and they did.
[SPEAKER_05]: So every little hole in the wall might be
a good growth store and half the time
[SPEAKER_05]: they're just doing it to get, you know,
super discounts for their own grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and so I don't know,
there's, there's, there's still a few up
[SPEAKER_05]: here that are, that are going to survive,
but like, yeah, go through Hayford,
[SPEAKER_05]: just shuttered businesses, restaurants,
um, salons, uh, daycares, uh, like people
[SPEAKER_05]: are moving.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, there's just not as many people
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's, it's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: The economy up here has always been boom
or bust.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's since, since white man showed up,
it's been fishing and logging and tan
[SPEAKER_05]: barking and a little bit of prohibition
alcohol running and, uh, gold up in
[SPEAKER_05]: Trinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and it just boom and bust,
boom and bust.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anytime you have that, that, that natural
resource extraction business, it's all
[SPEAKER_05]: boom and bust.
[SPEAKER_05]: And.
[SPEAKER_05]: When logging busted in the eighties,
seventies, eighties, um, all these little
[SPEAKER_05]: mill towns, you know, lost their mill,
which was their main source of jobs,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is why the town was created in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the people just kind of stuck
around and grew weed and towns didn't die.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then medical came through and created
a huge new, a revive the boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you had the green rush,
which, you know, these, these little towns
[SPEAKER_05]: were humming in the spring and harvesting
and humming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like every other truck had like,
was full of like supplies and potting soil
[SPEAKER_03]: and tourism from the migrant tremors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tons of business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you'd had all the tremors come in the
fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, you know, they would be in
town spending their cash at night at the
[SPEAKER_05]: bar or buying clothes or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they, they, they, you know,
they brought a bunch back home,
[SPEAKER_05]: but like, they still spent money there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like go to any bar during harvest season.
[SPEAKER_05]: On like a Friday night.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was packed, you know, shoulder to
shoulder.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most of the people didn't speak
English.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people from all over the place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, so it's, it's not like that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you don't have this huge influx of,
of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, if you weren't in the pot
industry and hated pot or cannabis for
[SPEAKER_05]: some reason, cause you know, you're just
like that, which there are people up here
[SPEAKER_05]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: All they see is the negative aspects of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if they're like, even if they're
benefiting financially, like even if
[SPEAKER_05]: they're plumbing business or you know,
whatever business is still benefiting,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, they would, you know, they,
they see all the people on the street and
[SPEAKER_05]: they would get all grumpy about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know, man, it's just like,
that's probably what it looked like in the
[SPEAKER_05]: early logging years and the early gold
rush years was they're just like people on
[SPEAKER_05]: the street, you know, trying to get on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, I mean, that's how their answers
probably ancestors probably showed up here
[SPEAKER_05]: the same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know, you know, so it's,
it's sad to see, and it's sad to see a
[SPEAKER_05]: whole like sort of culture and industry up
here sort of slowly die or it's,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's dying.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's transitioning to something else,
but I just feel like if we could empower
[SPEAKER_05]: all the small growers to unite and this
has been tried and people are still trying
[SPEAKER_05]: to do it now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I've definitely tried.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just trying to like spread the
idea to people that like, oh shit,
[SPEAKER_05]: like this could work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tough to get growers to agree on
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as soon as you join something,
that's the last time you get everything
[SPEAKER_05]: your way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, it's very, it's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: United.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're, we're the biggest player in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we have the best product.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have, um, the best genetic.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have, I mean, just the know-how up
here, the knowledge base, um, and every
[SPEAKER_05]: facet of growing, including compliance
and, um, extraction and like most of the
[SPEAKER_05]: innovators are up here, you know,
and especially on the traditional side,
[SPEAKER_05]: like that's the real heart of the,
of the culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's still up here as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all those genetics that people have
never seen before are still up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it's generational.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I don't know, just like to me,
it's a no-brainer, but it's just,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's very hard to get people to come
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, it, it certainly is helping right
now that the price is so low and people
[SPEAKER_05]: are realizing and like, oh shit,
like, but damn, like if I could just
[SPEAKER_05]: package up my ounces and get like 30 bucks
or 40 bucks an ounce, like that's more
[SPEAKER_05]: money than I'm getting wholesaling right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm like, how am I going to do sales?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, like, why don't you get
together with all the other farms on your
[SPEAKER_05]: road and, and, and, and make one,
one brand and everybody just chips in to
[SPEAKER_05]: buy those 10,000 Mylar bags and,
and, and, and you fill them up with the
[SPEAKER_05]: best stuff you have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you, you know, you, you, you hire
somebody to do sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so like, you're all paying one person.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're just paying like, you know,
one fifth of that person.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's my dream.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I think could be the savior of
a lot of people like me that like better.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if I was in this for the money,
I'd have quit already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, the money was nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's no avoiding.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no getting around that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that was good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't be here without it because how
else, how the hell else would I buy land?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I would have left a long
time ago and a lot of people have,
[SPEAKER_05]: they've it's like, okay, this,
this isn't profitable anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go on and do something else
or live somewhere else or on the flip side
[SPEAKER_03]: of what you just said, you took your money
and bought land.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people didn't, they bought toys
and didn't reinvest in this.
[SPEAKER_05]: All I ever wanted to do is grow weeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that was my toy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I, I want to spend my money on
a sweet greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, not a, you know, whatever a
sports car or a giant truck or something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or for kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dogs are good enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dogs keep me busy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, so yeah, that's my whole spiel
on co-ops and a boy, if anybody sees this,
[SPEAKER_05]: that, you know, if you're a legal grower,
hit me up on Instagram or something,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's going to take like minds to
get through all of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've seen no other way through this.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I started the breeder syndicate,
like the name, the idea behind the name,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like a, a, a bringing together of a
group of people with like minds,
[SPEAKER_03]: like that want to come together and
achieve a goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want, I see what all, what I was
seeing when I was starting this was
[SPEAKER_03]: humble, you know, Trinity County.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even from there, but I have a lot
of friends that are from there and their
[SPEAKER_03]: families are there and I care about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I realized, oh my God, no one,
no one that's been doing this their whole
[SPEAKER_03]: life has retirement plans.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just no retirement plans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there, there are things we can do to
make it a softer landing pad for a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people take away for us to be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's things you can establish and even
thinking about shit like that seems very
[SPEAKER_03]: high in the sky or, or thinking about
having a, a conglomeration of people to
[SPEAKER_03]: push back against the legal market by
bringing one big brand together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so doable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is, you know, it's been done
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's also, there's all these other
small co-ops you never hear about,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they're just buyers co-ops for like,
so that mom and pop hardware stores can
[SPEAKER_05]: buy drywall at a cheap enough price to
compete with Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's all that company exists for is
to just buy drywall and bulk and
[SPEAKER_05]: distribute it to all these like mom and
pop hardware stores.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they do exist and they allow mom and
pop to survive and compete, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: by capturing economies of scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, you know, that's, that's,
that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, even just in the legal realm,
you know, like when it happened,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you know, half my friends converted
to legal and half of them didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most of them are not growing anymore
on either, it doesn't matter which side,
[SPEAKER_05]: but most of them, most of them aren't,
you know, either they went legal and then
[SPEAKER_05]: gave up on that and, and, and went back to
the, to the traditional side or,
[SPEAKER_05]: or they got jobs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and the people on the
traditional side, you know, they've gone
[SPEAKER_05]: from outdoor to indoor because there's,
there's tougher enforcement now and
[SPEAKER_05]: they're, they're red tagging your
property.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everybody's kind of transitioned a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, just depending on how,
how well you were situated for the
[SPEAKER_05]: transition, it was, a lot of it was just
luck that I'm still here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've, I've been fortunate to have a lot of
good luck.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just by like, it's dumb luck.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, I didn't foresee everything
working out how it did.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just happened to work out that it,
it worked out for me because just,
[SPEAKER_05]: I happen to have a good property for it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've, and I've made sacrifices to have
that property.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the part that's not luck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's the part that's not luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are reasons that you can make
kind of luck, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when it comes down to it,
like, yeah, like I could, I could have
[SPEAKER_05]: easily bought a property closer to town
that wasn't so remote and tough to get to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that was kind of good for the old
days, but it's a huge pain in the ass now
[SPEAKER_05]: to live a life.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, I never could have
afforded this property close to town.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, it was cheap because it
was so remote.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's, that's all it comes down
to.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's 90 minutes away from any type
of town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, that's out there, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that used to be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's, now it's not so much,
but I admire it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still fortunate to be in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm not going to, I have at
least one more year, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: before I really got to look and see if
this is working or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hopefully, hopefully people will get
together and realize their, the power and
[SPEAKER_03]: collectivism because there's true power in
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there are reasons why people
don't know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The need to capture added value to your
product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, some of the trade
organizations are working on consumer
[SPEAKER_05]: direct sales for small farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a, there's a thing called the Ship
Act at the national level, which,
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it hasn't been voted on yet,
but it would be a writer on some other
[SPEAKER_05]: bill to say, like when that, when legal,
federal legalization does happen,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're giving small farms under such and
such a size path to retail sales
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves, as opposed to having to go
through dispensaries and stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, that's what the small farm
needs to survive is, is, is, is farmers
[SPEAKER_05]: markets, you know, let, let that small
farm sell direct to their consumer.
[SPEAKER_05]: People want that anyways, but then they
can capture these, cut out the middle man
[SPEAKER_05]: and capture the added value of making
retail sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, the wine industry already does
this with their wine clubs and their
[SPEAKER_05]: tasting rooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you can come to the vineyard,
come to the winery, taste, taste what
[SPEAKER_05]: there is to taste, buy a bottle or two or,
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hang out every, every farm's not going to
be set up to do that, but collectively we
[SPEAKER_05]: could definitely set something up like
that and join our, our wine club.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let, let us send you an ounce a month.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you know, buy a subscription,
get an ounce a month or, or, or whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: it ends up being.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, those winery, when you go by to
wine country and buy wine there,
[SPEAKER_05]: like you're paying, you're paying an
inflated price.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not getting it cheaper because
you're at the source.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're paying more for it.
Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even want, I don't even want to
charge more.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to charge retail, a fair
retail price just so I can make a living.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And show people like, yes, like this weed
is better than what you're finding in the
[SPEAKER_05]: store.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Once, once enough farms are able to do
that and like actually have a client base.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully they can sell direct,
but the, to the people that can't get
[SPEAKER_05]: shipped weed or the people that can't show
up to the farmer's market, they're going
[SPEAKER_05]: to look for it in the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that'll drive sales to these
dispensaries that are fighting us tooth
[SPEAKER_05]: and nail to not allow us to sell consumer
direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that is so important.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I think it's one of the most
important things to talk about is the
[SPEAKER_03]: power of collectivism and being able to,
to push back against the corporate shit
[SPEAKER_03]: going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I saw this with 64, like I was like,
Oh, they're probably going to make it more
[SPEAKER_03]: illegal for us to grow more illegal for
corporations to sell weed, which in turn
[SPEAKER_03]: makes it more legal for them to grow weed
with the right licenses and more expensive
[SPEAKER_03]: for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they'll break us money wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, I mean the old, the old cow
growers association has a Kyle Allen,
[SPEAKER_05]: like he had to fight tooth and nail just
to not set California up as like a six
[SPEAKER_05]: license state, like some of these other
East coast states where, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's just six licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it to let, to let these small
farms, like, uh, one, one of his buddies,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, uh, Casey O'Neill said a long time
ago, if you don't have a seat at the
[SPEAKER_05]: table, you're on the menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, and that's exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why, you know, getting behind
these trade organizations that,
[SPEAKER_05]: that are made up of small farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's one broad trade
organization made up of these small farm
[SPEAKER_05]: trade organizations that lobbies at the
state level to, to, to push back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to, to these, these huge money,
corporate interests that can pay lobbyists
[SPEAKER_05]: and lawyers to write regulations for the
state to say, no, you got a whole region
[SPEAKER_05]: up here that needs something else.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there, there are voice and that's why
you gotta be, you gotta be a little
[SPEAKER_05]: politically active in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that goes back to the two 15 days too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to educate city councils.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to, you had to, you had to be,
you had to be an activist if you're going
[SPEAKER_05]: to be in cannabis, because you had to
like, you had to, you were pushing through
[SPEAKER_05]: new, like Virgin territory and you weren't
just going to set up a shop and just do
[SPEAKER_05]: business, you know, cause there's going to
be forces coming back at you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you got to be active and pushing
against them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like that old term, all politics
is local.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like realistically, a lot of people pay
attention to the, the, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: nation's news every night, but pay
attention to what's going on immediately
[SPEAKER_03]: around you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It matters so much more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's on your city council or your board
of supervisors or your planning
[SPEAKER_05]: commission.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, especially if you're in business and
any business in that area, that's going to
[SPEAKER_05]: play a much, a much bigger role in the
success of your business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause they might just regulate you out of
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause somebody's going to be in their ear
wanting one thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're not in their ear,
chirping about the other thing,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're, you're, yeah, you're, you're going
to get put out of business.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're, you know, you're going to,
you're going to let Walmart move in unless
[SPEAKER_05]: you say something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're done.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Walmart's definitely in your,
your supervisor's ear.
[SPEAKER_05]: You better, you better be in the other ear
talking about, nah, this is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can afford the lobbyists.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have to be as smart and as
active, more active and smarter,
[SPEAKER_05]: more active and just unite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, we've always been independent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when the price was high, it was easy
to be independent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's just like, no, like you
gotta, you gotta be, if you want to do
[SPEAKER_05]: this, you gotta be thinking 10 years
ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you want it to look like and start
now because somebody else already has that
[SPEAKER_05]: vision.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what they do for a living is
manipulate things for their benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and we're kind of all just all
learning to come out of the shadows and,
[SPEAKER_05]: and, and kind of learn how the system
really works, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, dude, we've almost hit two hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to have you back again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can talk about tons of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know people are going to enjoy this
and like forum stuff to talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So dude, it's been an absolute pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about some of your,
the places where people can find you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Instagram, Little Hill Cultivators.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can hit me up, DM me, define my
product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know MendoCan and Organican don't
have any right now, but they should soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, they, they've, they've been supporting
the small farms up here for a long time
[SPEAKER_05]: and, and, and, and giving us our
recognition sort of, they also do a cool
[SPEAKER_05]: thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are in NorCal, like in November,
December, they do this cool thing every
[SPEAKER_05]: year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've been doing it since before 64,
where they'll sell a taste of the,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, it's called a harvest box or
something like that, where it's got 28
[SPEAKER_05]: grams, like individual grams from 28 farms
of 28 strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you can like, it's, they call it
the taste of harvest or something like
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so like, they'll go through all,
you know, they get entries, maybe 60 farms
[SPEAKER_05]: submit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they just pick out the best 28.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been lucky enough to be in it for
the past, I don't know, maybe four years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I hope to be in it again this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't, like that hasn't been settled
yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, listen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, still support them because they've
been supporting small farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if I don't make it, like,
I don't, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they're still doing good work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and right now that's the only place,
um, I think you could, you could find me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they definitely don't have anything
from last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think they're going to get re-upped
with some sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've already smoked it and I'm fairly sure
it'll, it'll, it'll do well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, that's where you can find me.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any props you want to give to any of the
homies from the past, future, present,
[SPEAKER_03]: any of it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All, all, all, all my, all my buddies up
here, CSI, 707.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I seem to have like a lot of friends on
Instagram too, that, that do good work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, uh, my old mentor, Seaweed,
uh, um, his name didn't really come up on,
[SPEAKER_05]: on, on this run, but, uh, it did on that
last one.
[SPEAKER_05]: We forgot to record.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for people that don't know,
we had like an hour's worth of awesome
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff not recorded because I didn't hit
the record button.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is round two, but yeah,
it gets us more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to Trinity County, um, and the people
trying to make it happen up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they're, they're a rare breed and
tough people and, um, so props to them and
[SPEAKER_05]: then Humboldt Mendo as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's kind of been through the
wringer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you for your time and we will
be having you back again soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, we'll see everyone again next
week.
