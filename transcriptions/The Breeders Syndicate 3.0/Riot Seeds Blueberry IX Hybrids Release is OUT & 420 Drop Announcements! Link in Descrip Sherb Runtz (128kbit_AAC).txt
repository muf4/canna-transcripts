[SPEAKER_00]: Hey what's up everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to give a quick quick video
about some of the new blue drops we have
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as some of you know I've been working
on the blue bonnet stuff for around five
[SPEAKER_00]: years now and one of my main goals in
doing all this was to go through DJ
[SPEAKER_00]: Short's full supply en masse some of the
hybrids made with some of his stuff and to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of find out what the true best
blueberry was and when I say blueberry I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't just mean the strain I mean
something that looks as beautiful as DJ
[SPEAKER_00]: Short's blueberries looked in his
photography over the years since the 90s
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as having extreme blueberry turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's blueberry jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of artificial blueberry
smells that are so strong they can
[SPEAKER_00]: overpower OG Kush in a room any kind of
dank anything you have going on they
[SPEAKER_00]: should be able to overpower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took about five years to perfect a
seed line that I felt best represented it
[SPEAKER_00]: and I feel like we've made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I feel like it's in seed form
now I feel comfortable saying that feel
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable telling people that every pack
you can find multiple different
[SPEAKER_00]: expressions of like blueberry slushy
blueberry candy blueberry bubblegum
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry you know jam blueberry compote
you know like all sorts of blueberry and
[SPEAKER_00]: from there we decided while we were doing
this last line to include some of the more
[SPEAKER_00]: modern lines that I had been ignoring for
many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my good friends Spindle had some
really really dank modern lines that he's
[SPEAKER_00]: been you know selling a flower of that
some of his fan base enjoys and that he in
[SPEAKER_00]: turn as a blueberry fiend has enjoyed as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took in some sherb cream pie I don't
know who that's from or exactly what's in
[SPEAKER_00]: it but it's so sherby it's so frosty great
calyx to leaf ratio not seeing any mold in
[SPEAKER_00]: any of it and we cross that to the the
blueberry in cross and we're calling that
[SPEAKER_00]: blue cocky because you know cream pie blue
cocky is kind of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to farmer Dan for that beautiful
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that there's lines out there
called blue runs blue sushi all this other
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to smoke a bunch of white runs early
on and I thought it was pretty decent for
[SPEAKER_00]: what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this run we decided to add white
runs and make a true blueberry runs like
[SPEAKER_00]: let's make a candy strain of blue and
something that appeals to the masses
[SPEAKER_00]: because the overall idea like I've been
I've been very much against isolating
[SPEAKER_00]: myself from the cookie crowd the sherb
crowd the gelato crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've dabbled in it but I haven't really
fully reached into it and in order to do
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to do to bring the younger
generation into understanding genetics we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to tap into that and I felt that the
blueberry in cross into like a white runs
[SPEAKER_00]: would be an excellent way of doing that
showing that you can breed you can breed
[SPEAKER_00]: lines that have these true blueberry turps
cross them into something and make them
[SPEAKER_00]: something unique you don't just need to
smash like into like into like into like
[SPEAKER_00]: and take the easy route.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one is the trot berry now
dosey dose out of all the cookies crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: I think archive probably nailed it the
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some really really good stuff
coming out of dosey dose nonstop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another line that I've really liked turp
wise was the trot cherry and I had a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to have a trot cherry dosey dose
and that also made it into the blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: in cross line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll combine insanely well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope you guys enjoy what you get
but overall my main purpose is the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry in cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a lot of them um there's actually a
blue candy direction there's a blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: jam direction and then there's more of the
blueberry kush direction so it's heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy blueberry jam with some of the kush
nuances of the earthy cushy type uh
[SPEAKER_00]: expression so there's something for
everyone in there it's currently available
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of them have already been shipped
from the pre-orders pre-orders got the
[SPEAKER_00]: best price however if you're a part of our
patreon you get 30 off each pack when you
[SPEAKER_00]: order um cost five dollars a month to join
our patreon and that usually is there to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the trolls out and stand kind of damn
good job and when they do sneak in they
[SPEAKER_00]: still get booted pretty fast because you
guys know how i roll you know like no
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance for bullshit anyways um yeah go
check that out in uh 420 i've got some
[SPEAKER_00]: great announcements we have mad elite
joining us finally with some of his i-95
[SPEAKER_00]: work i know a lot of you are looking for
og kush and c form um as far as regular
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds go i don't think anybody's done
better than mad elite and i can say that
[SPEAKER_00]: wholeheartedly um his chem lines as far as
regular lines go nothing beats it nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: has come even close his resurrection line
i feel like was the epitome of chem 91 and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything chem 90 was chem 91 was when
they originally popped that seed i get i
[SPEAKER_00]: finally get why that line and cut was held
for so long and so popular once i smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: that um we're gonna have some resurrection
stuff in there uh sfv across to chem d
[SPEAKER_00]: i-95 headband i can d i-95 snowdog chem d
i-95 east coast sour diesel chem d i-95
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's it's a plethora of riches on top
of that we use sativa heads because there
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's a growing contingent people are
finally getting that like longer flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: strains can be just as dank as any um the
high is what matters to a lot of us you
[SPEAKER_00]: know like it's not just the hype not just
the name and in hopes that we're smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: what all these other people are talking
about and he has a bunch of mango hay
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff dropping and in my opinion shanty
baba's work was pinnacled by mango haze
[SPEAKER_00]: and neville's work was was obviously
neville's haze but i think mango haze is a
[SPEAKER_00]: is a worthy competitor and uh yeah and
with people who buy two packs of that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can also get some shoreline cross to
vietnam black and the cough so there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of opportunities for some really
really dank stuff um baselines for other
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders to work into their own work which
a lot of us breed for breeders i feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: what i do is breeding for breeders much
less so than commercial croppers though it
[SPEAKER_00]: does work for both um there's nothing
better than being someone who breeds for
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders though in my mind like that 's
the biggest accomplishment so anyway i
[SPEAKER_00]: just wanted to take a moment to uh let you
guys all know about this stuff um it's up
[SPEAKER_00]: it's already shipping it ships pretty fast
because it's all packaged up ready to rock
[SPEAKER_00]: so um yeah be a part of the blueberry
revolution before it's gone because it
[SPEAKER_00]: will be gone and um because this iteration
i feel is the pinnacle of what i've done
[SPEAKER_00]: it may be where i move on from blueberry
finally after the past five years even
[SPEAKER_00]: though that's like been my life uh my life
goal to to leave something behind that was
[SPEAKER_00]: better than what i started with and uh
yeah i mean that's our motto you know
[SPEAKER_00]: leave the plant better better than you got
it before you're gone so yeah anyways um
[SPEAKER_00]: join our patreon discord uh ufc 300 this
weekend so we can be watching that
[SPEAKER_00]: together and uh all kinds of other cool
