time, kick back and enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like the show, feel free to like
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's your second viewing,
we ask a gentle person's agreement that
[SPEAKER_01]: you click the subscribe button.
[SPEAKER_01]: It costs you nothing, but it helps us
tremendously with the sneaky YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: algorithm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leaving comments, telling not so his voice
lulls you into a trance works as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope you take the time to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to put out the best possible shows
for you we can and want to build this
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again from all of us at the
Breeders Syndicate family.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was like, it was like I was
connected with everything around me.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of a sudden, I just started
questioning everything I'd ever been told.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, by the time, by the time I got
high, that very first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it started to hit me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mouser's not with us today, but we do have
Mad Jag and Raho for episode number four
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Mad Jag and Raho Chronicles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we were talking a little bit
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of wanted to go over some of
someone that we mentioned a lot in the
[SPEAKER_01]: past few episodes, who is R, the
connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been going over some of his past
work and we all have a special admiration
[SPEAKER_01]: for the guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we keep bringing him up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we thought that would be kind of a neat
idea to talk a little bit more about some
[SPEAKER_01]: of his work and what we admire so much
about the man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So welcome, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you had a happy New Year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you want to jump off at?
[SPEAKER_01]: We were the first article we were reading
was a five year review.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: September 1979.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found High Times, I think, about when it
started in 1974 and started reading it
[SPEAKER_00]: avidly and collecting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once R showed up, I don't know what
issue it was exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really cool to have someone who was
in New York City right in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and had access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, he had lots of dealer friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had access to all the strains that were
coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that particular issue, the fifth
anniversary, 1979, was largely about the
[SPEAKER_00]: advent of gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Santa Marta gold first showed up,
Colombian gold, and how it blew everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: away and they were just digging it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the course of a year or two,
it made the brown weeds and other weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: like Oaxacan, let's just say, or
Michoacan, Guerrero in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently he said even tie stick it
people didn't want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted something that was gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: All they cared about was that the weed
would be gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he mentions that a lot of the reasons
they were gold were the way they sun dried
[SPEAKER_00]: them or the way they were fermenting on
their trip to the United States in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to hold the ship or warehousing in the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: because they would hold onto it and wait
until the prices got higher in the summer
[SPEAKER_00]: when there was a drought and there was no
harvesting being done immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just holding it in the warehouse
helped change its color.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, he said,
it also precipitated the weeds that had
[SPEAKER_00]: mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that hasn't been initially dried
correctly or packaged.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing that's so important about the
article is he's he's really documenting
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the first times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's maybe the first time a major
market shift based on appearances was ever
[SPEAKER_03]: really documented, you know, and it's it's
swept through the United States markets,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, multiple times over the last 20
years, whether it was moving from you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, just just green bud or a kind bud to
purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody had to have purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of a sudden, you know,
plants and cuttings that had been around
[SPEAKER_03]: for 15, 20 years, just, you know,
foundation lines that people had had bred
[SPEAKER_03]: with and kept around for forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, cuttings got lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were neglected.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got pushed to the side because
everybody had to have, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in order to sell, you had to have weed
that looked like what the buyers were
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that turned into purple, just like R
was talking about in what 78, 70,
[SPEAKER_03]: 79.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody, you know, wouldn't buy it
unless it was gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so the dealers started, you know,
coming up with ways to make not gold look
[SPEAKER_03]: like gold so they can sell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's just it's the same
story over and over again, repeating
[SPEAKER_03]: itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it took place in in Amsterdam,
you know, multiple, multiple times where
[SPEAKER_03]: some new thing came in and everything had
to had to have those superficial traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's you know, the market
drives towards those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we we we assess the product with
our eyes first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smell comes next.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can really get a really get all the
different senses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, in today's market,
unfortunately, I think like that that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: thing of the past, being able to see it,
smell it, you know, touch it, feel the
[SPEAKER_01]: consistency with with the invent of mylar
bagging and, you know, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It at the corporate level that people have
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy to me that people can't smell
their bud before they smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, look, that's, you know,
always talking about these same things in
[SPEAKER_03]: 1979.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, you know, people people
lamenting, you know, cookies and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, mylar bags that you can't see
what's in them and, you know, a sticker
[SPEAKER_03]: with a lion's side, you know, I mean,
but it's it's this is an old story.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been going on a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It drives.
[SPEAKER_03]: It drives breeding in in the wrong
directions, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the other things that I noticed
about our in his in his ability to be
[SPEAKER_01]: prophetic was his really famous article
that pissed a lot of people off,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was banned the Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember that article at all is
banned article where he in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: prophetically tells everyone that,
you know, this thing's going to come in,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to dumb down weed weeds,
never going to be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he was more of the trippy sativa,
you know, like he liked that high that
[SPEAKER_01]: that clear headed high or that speedy racy
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he felt like Indica's was just going
to completely come in, dumb it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the market would be mostly Indica
dominant because of the ease of growth for
[SPEAKER_01]: for indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it almost like told the tale
of what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with cookies and push like
prophetically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Timing the timing on that article was
right on the money because, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the the AFI, the Indica's had basically
made it into every nook and cranny of the
[SPEAKER_03]: American market by that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody wanted seeds to grow an AFI could
find them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was just so much variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you think about the various
paths that these seeds took, the
[SPEAKER_03]: connections that were made, you know,
the it's it's amazing to think about that
[SPEAKER_03]: that network of of genetics just just
exploding overnight and spreading around
[SPEAKER_03]: the country because two years earlier,
you know, it was scarce as hen's teeth,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, getting getting Indica in 1980,
1981, you know, hard to find rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, you know, not maybe not in the
hills of NorCal, but everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in two years, it was turned,
you know, up overnight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just it was everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody had their own seeds and were
growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can expand on this just a little
bit, because it's something I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: drive home to a lot of the younger people,
because I think and based on how often I
[SPEAKER_01]: see people make claims of having these
Afghanis from the early 60s and so and
[SPEAKER_01]: even 40s in some cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we can we kind of drive home the point
when Afghanis when you both saw Afghanis
[SPEAKER_01]: in the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Either one of you on that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for me, it was when I met Rob Clark
and bought my skunk number one seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: he had Afghani number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was the first time I had heard
of it or really seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just he gave me a little free hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every pack of a few compared to the mass
of skunk number one that we bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I I know I grew them maybe in a little
side patch or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was it definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was part of the genetics of skunk
number one anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had Afghani in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the leaves were medium sized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They they weren't these needle,
beautiful, long needle sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was it piqued our interest and we
were going, wonder why these leaves are so
[SPEAKER_00]: wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do they look straight at any part?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember them being smaller plants
compared to the rest and thinking,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the hell?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even remember growing those
Afghani number ones, but that's where I
[SPEAKER_00]: first heard of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when when Clark told me the genetics
involved in skunk number one, I went,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's in here, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't totally agree with our on that,
because we have the ability to have all of
[SPEAKER_00]: them now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can have land race,
beautiful sativas from Nepal, some remote
[SPEAKER_00]: little zomia that you've discovered and a
real seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can have pure Afghans if you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess was it Tom Hill who had maple
leaf or deep chunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, deep chunk.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't that a pure Afghani or a hybrid of
a few Afghanis?
[SPEAKER_03]: He he says it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says it's pure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The maple leaf was Neville's stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: As it as it spread around, you know,
he sold it under different names and other
[SPEAKER_03]: people got the seeds from him,
did their selections and sold sold stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Under different names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was one of the early baselines,
the maple leaf from him, one that an
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghani that kept passing into other lines
under different names.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Supposedly, the the the the maple leaf is
the possibly supposedly the back end of
[SPEAKER_01]: super skunk and what is making super skunk
so skunky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, you know, it's Afghan tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, Afghan tea is maple leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I say maybe is because
there are also some theories, even among
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville's old partners, that it was really
Afghani one renamed Afghan tea,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is possible, you know, especially
knowing Neve.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like very possible because he
disliked he disliked, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam the skunk been quite a bit by that
point and giving him credit for one of his
[SPEAKER_01]: best lines when he already had half the
credit for NL five pays, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: was probably not Neville's idea of things
he was going to let happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know some of the other partners kind
of share that Afghani one theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He certainly, you know, spoke had nothing
good to say about Afghani number one when
[SPEAKER_03]: he was back on the forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was interesting the language
that he used.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very nonspecific.
[SPEAKER_03]: He called it toxic in a bad way.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he needed to say, like, there's that
good toxic, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the it's a bad toxic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes to the point of like I saw
him like it constantly referencing Afghani
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even at points where I'm like,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you bringing it up right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're talking about superstructure
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's bringing up Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just like, it's almost like he's
guilty to me, not guilty, but maybe his
[SPEAKER_01]: conscience coming out and being like,
well, here's a little hint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a little hint for the people
actually give a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little little breadcrumbs that I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be all in my head, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there were there were a lot of
good lines around that didn't turn into
[SPEAKER_03]: these legends that are sought after.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the ones I wonder,
you know, what happened if they if they
[SPEAKER_03]: would ever pop up again.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, Khyber, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was that looked a lot like stuff I
grew at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it was fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I always wanted to get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But by the time I discovered seeds online,
you know, it was already yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was already kind of the market was all
screwed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dutch and totally screwed everything
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, it's interesting,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Side note, I just got this in.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, this in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that me and actually
CSI mostly I found out about it much
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were told about it by Mustafunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is from the breeder of the
Pakistani Chitral Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the whole record of the dude who
bred it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Isidoro Rodriguez.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's all in Castilian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be fun to try to read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the breeding of Chitral is all laid
out in here in pictures and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So props to Mustafunk for putting us in
the right direction on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there is a guy you need to get on the
Internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All this Santa Marta, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecuadorian or Peruvian or Bolivian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were more into coca, but I'm sure
someone there had the ability to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working for the article.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell me the the date on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: For which?
[SPEAKER_03]: For the R.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the fifth.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is September of nineteen seventy
nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seventy nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seventy nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it talks about the past five years
that he's been there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's in the first division he has at
the age and plenty of variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they have the rise of the exotics,
which is hilarious considering what they
[SPEAKER_01]: consider exotics now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the narrowing of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the Colombian Gold Rush.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rise of Fool's Gold and the decline of
Colombian.
[SPEAKER_01]: The advent of Sin Samia, which I still
think magic has something to do with and
[SPEAKER_01]: the embryonic third generation and the
first signs of new hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: The age and plenty of variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I don't know if I should be
reading the whole thing, but generally
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking, we have the menu here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's an Ethiopian emperor stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice little dense nuggetry there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And along with some kush, some this is an
old picture of Afghani if it's seventy
[SPEAKER_01]: nine kush smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember these pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when this magazine came out and
the colors on that page from that
[SPEAKER_03]: Ethiopian emperor stash, the bright
emerald green and the red.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just just gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way it was kind of similar
condition to that, what they call kush
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke down below it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they both look like this wasn't
something that was manicured.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, put in and protected.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was something that was thrown in a
baggie and carried around in a backpack
[SPEAKER_03]: for for several weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it looks like that.
And.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't see a lot of seeds in the in
the kush that Ethiopian definitely lit my
[SPEAKER_03]: imagination all the all the while back
then.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think about, you know,
could there be some something special in
[SPEAKER_03]: an Ethiopian wine?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, especially these old ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has the menu here from the week of
June 16th, 1974 for the prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it shows like Mexican commercial at
200, Oaxacan tops at three thirty,
[SPEAKER_01]: Michoacan at five fifty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have the Colombian reds,
multi and gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember when I was talking to one
of the guys who would bring in Colombia in
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida, you would always talk about how
you had to buy a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombian rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe he called it, which was the
multi like they're referring to here,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like all of it kind of compressed and
combined the reds, blacks, gold and the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom end of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for every 10 kilos of that you
would buy, you'd be able to buy like two
[SPEAKER_01]: kilos of the black or one kilo of the red
or one kilo of the gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always thought that was fascinating that
there was like some kind of market trade
[SPEAKER_01]: like that where you can get you had to buy
a certain amount to get the higher tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like Panama reds at the top in 74 as
far as the the highest priced demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six hundred a pound, whereas, you know,
commercial Mexicans at 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: So three times the price of shitty
commercial Mexican being in all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's talking about the rise of exotic
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, by the end of the first year,
in addition to all the goodies on that
[SPEAKER_01]: menu above, almost every time you showed
up at Crosby's or similar smoking saloons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess there were smoking saloons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere, which that sounds fascinating
for the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it needs more saloons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: New exciting sighting sample example of by
surprising second generation dopes by the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The menu would include the following
premium priced entries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the Chaco Chiba or at least Chiba
sixty five Colombian per ounce wacky weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what our talks about all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seventy five an ounce and the Santa
Barbara gold for 60 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that time, wacky weeds killing it,
whereas the ties at 200 to 240 an ounce
[SPEAKER_01]: per stick at 15 to 20 and Hawaiian at 160.
[SPEAKER_01]: So significantly above the Colombian at
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here, you can see a picture of the
Jamaican lamb's bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very early picture of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's the wacky weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Colombian wacky weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you want to explain why he called
it wacky weed, Rob?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think no, honestly,
I've never had anybody sell me anything
[SPEAKER_03]: called wacky weed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hearing these descriptions of it,
I know Jackie and I probably both are
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking this sounds familiar,
but it's like Madjag source of the candy
[SPEAKER_03]: bar, the black, highly compressed super
super weed that was sliced off with a
[SPEAKER_03]: razor blade like cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's.
[SPEAKER_03]: You hear similar kind of attributes or
traits to the effect to this, but it's
[SPEAKER_03]: it's definitely not the same thing
because, you know, there was just that one
[SPEAKER_03]: farmer up there crafting that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never saw anything like like what they
said of wacky weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nickname in 1970 in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a weed that I never saw again
that they call cartoon weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you smoke this, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't stop laughing from the moment
you took the first few puffs and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just everything became a cartoon in a
sense that you couldn't hold back and stop
[SPEAKER_00]: laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: More typical from when people eat
cannabis, you know, they get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: giggles and then maybe into just laughing
so hard they have tears running down their
[SPEAKER_00]: eye out of their eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cartoon weed, wacky weed, you know,
nickname.
[SPEAKER_00]: Names that I guess if you smoked wacky
weed, you'd get whacked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just overly powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he refers to in a lot of these
articles as he almost refers to it as if
[SPEAKER_01]: he thinks maybe it's either a strain or
expression or something that can be gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: more than once from the same farmer and
that it's an actual.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like he's talking about like it's
a strain, but I think more than likely it
[SPEAKER_01]: was just highly compressed, really high
end Colombian where the oils have really
[SPEAKER_01]: soaked in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to that bud, maybe even hash
coated like our oil hash oil compressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it sounds like it just made
people absolutely stupid and lose control
[SPEAKER_01]: of their limbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fellow I knew in Chicagoland in 1970,
71 had high school kids making tie sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the same same little splinters of
they were like bamboo stakes, little tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would pay these kids to sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was good since Mia early stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had them wrap the buds very
carefully on these sticks because he could
[SPEAKER_00]: quadruple the money he charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was an early entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lately, a lot of people have been
talking about the Choco Chiva Colombian,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially since we did the Choco Chiva
chocolate tie episode a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right here, it talks about the
entrance of the Chiva, at least that
[SPEAKER_01]: region in Colombia where stuff was
imported from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says, well, tie was certainly the
most clamor among the new treats served
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think not enough credit has gone to
Chiva, which for the sake of historical
[SPEAKER_01]: justice deserves a footnote as the first
high level breakthrough to second
[SPEAKER_01]: generation quality grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're referring to Chiva maybe as a
second generation type Colombian gold or
[SPEAKER_01]: gold type.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chiva hit the stage shortly before time
and opened up a lot of minds to the higher
[SPEAKER_01]: possibilities of grass, opened up a lot of
wallets, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a closer to a psychedelic than any
other previous grass available
[SPEAKER_01]: breathtaking, rushy, super energetic and
cerebral grass and demonstrated to the
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana marketers that people would pay
seventy five dollars an ounce,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost double what they were accustomed
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the grass was like Chiva, a quantum
leap above the ordinary, Chiva established
[SPEAKER_01]: the reality of the high priced gourmet
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, the supply began to match
the demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was talks about Chiva followed
by other Colombian specialties like the
[SPEAKER_01]: wacky weed and the tie and and other stuff
like that coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it talks about the nearing of the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the first things to go was the
Panama red.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, I know like there are people
that sell different kinds of Panamanians
[SPEAKER_01]: out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as what a true Panama red is,
I don't know if anybody agrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can either of you comment on Panama red or
your experience with the red?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you have any?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I didn't know whether what
I got was Colombian red or Panama red.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to think it was Panama red.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was certainly an amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The weed itself was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's pretty, pretty lame
descriptive words, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I just looked up to see if when we gave up
the Panama Canal to back to Panama,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to figure out what might
have, you know, besides, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe they just got tired of growing weed
down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, you know, but what what
would be the reasons why something like
[SPEAKER_03]: that might happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like part of that happened during
the Carter presidency, which would have
[SPEAKER_03]: would have been a right around the right
timeline.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure why.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, as far as the quality of
that of that weed, you know, potent,
[SPEAKER_03]: tasty, unique effects, good effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, definitely in a kind of
rarefied air, like, you know, man,
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, I hope I ever get to smoke
something this good again.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it happens, you know it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it just was so uncommon
that talking about it disappearing,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, would have been like what you
mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am never going to get to smoke this
again for the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I already I already believed it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, maybe maybe different people in
different circles got that connoisseur
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff flowing through nonstop like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that wasn't my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about you, Jaggy?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your experience with the Panama?
[SPEAKER_00]: Four finger baggie for fifteen dollars in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nineteen seventy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nineteen seventy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's early, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sixty nine and seventy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Denver sixty nine seventy and
seventy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was right up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the advent of Sinsemea, where seedless
weed was starting to separate itself from
[SPEAKER_00]: the traditional seeded weed and pressed
from the super pressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started to see, you know, even Oaxacan
Spears in entirety, just colas wrapped in
[SPEAKER_00]: cellophane pressed lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, some big bundle in your
arms might only weigh four pounds or five
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds because it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And true, there was more stem that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the quality of the Spears,
it didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Panama Red to me was in that top tier back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nineteen seventy quality wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the smell, the aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember it standing out any more
than Colombian gold or anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it might have had an edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It disappeared at some point pretty
quickly and has has our as our has
[SPEAKER_00]: explained his gold just, you know,
the Colombians don't do anything small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very organized, so they started
shipping not just tons, but freighters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who brought in freighters in like the East
Coast of Florida with two hundred two
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred fifty thousand pounds in a load.
[SPEAKER_00]: He eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had too many employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just the offloaders on the docks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like 30 people and eventually
someone got in trouble and they they were
[SPEAKER_00]: facing big time and they rolled and went
right up the chain to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I probably bought my first ounce of
weed in Denver from his group because they
[SPEAKER_00]: were sending from these freighter loads to
Chicago, Denver, New York, all the major
[SPEAKER_00]: cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Colombian just eclipsed the Panama
Red, along with Mexican, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't until Mexico got really focused
on high quality, you know, the Guerrero
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Sinaloa and the Oaxacan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were mostly people bringing small
loads like airplane loads where they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have to have them sitting in a
freighter for three weeks while it's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up from Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but gold that gold was very big
presence, super presence when it came.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came big.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I think people wanted it so
badly, you know, because you might get
[SPEAKER_00]: some one time that was super potent and
then another one next time that was super
[SPEAKER_00]: moldy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, very difficult unless you had an
inside line to the importers themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, where you could get the tops and the
best parts of each pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a fascinating man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder I wonder if I noticed in a lot of
these bold articles, he repeatedly talks
[SPEAKER_01]: about the disappearance of Colombian to at
some point that that Colombian kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: died off for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it first was a Panama law,
then came Colombian.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder if it was just the the push
of Mexico being so much closer to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and being that it was so much easier to
smuggle from Mexico than having to go all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way down to South America for Colombia
and move it all the way up until they had
[SPEAKER_01]: some kind of in route worked with the
groups in Mexico to smuggle up for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and eventually Colombians did
come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made a return for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he talks about that in some of the
later articles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think a lot of the the rise of
homegrown in America happened about the
[SPEAKER_03]: same time that that cocaine started taking
over as far as what they wanted to fill
[SPEAKER_03]: their airplanes with the smuggle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, those two things happened about
the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So commercial Colombian, you know,
the heyday of Colombian dominating the
[SPEAKER_03]: weed market, it it literally went away
like over.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seemed like it was almost overnight.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just definitely over the
course of one year, it went from,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, Colombian was everywhere to who
wants that shit to you can't even find it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just happened so fast with with good
homegrown showing up around the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: The the Indica show Indica seeds showing
up around the country all around that same
[SPEAKER_03]: eighty two, eighty three.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nineteen eighty three time frame really is
when it when it was everywhere.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a photo here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see if it'll show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes along with what we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the share thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I here go to present.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's call me is green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an article that was I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2019, this was published, but it shows
all the major weed growing areas in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Calca Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cali is right up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the bottom, Popayan down here is a
famous area, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a lot of famous areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all islands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highland Corinto.
[SPEAKER_00]: See Corinto.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple Corinto.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a famous one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not heard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the the quotes that Mar has
here, it says gold looks so good that
[SPEAKER_01]: people became conditioned to the notion if
grass wasn't gold, it couldn't be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the glitters is not great grass and
not all great grass is gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this to me, like as a as a person who
grew up post, you know, it really heavily
[SPEAKER_01]: started smoking in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea of gold or brown weed to me was
just like a bummer, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at some point in the U.S.,
like we've talked about people really did
[SPEAKER_01]: genuinely expect gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people were trying to figure out home
growers were trying to figure out how to
[SPEAKER_01]: get their plants to dry gold because it
just wasn't selling for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what this is referring
to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, this is this is like
seventy six or seventy seven there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seventy nine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is I mean, you just have to
understand that a very small window of
[SPEAKER_03]: time where markets transitioning and
reacting to demand for something like like
[SPEAKER_03]: a color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how and how, you know, growers and
middlemen around, you know, around the
[SPEAKER_03]: world are trying to trying to make what
they have sell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, we saw it with cookies and,
you know, the wide variety of dessert weed
[SPEAKER_03]: out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: When cookies first came out, you know,
it was the cut was hoarded.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And seed seed form, you know, the people
that had it, you know, everybody wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: it, but it didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the market invented it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like what we were talking about that
the other day was, you know, if you give
[SPEAKER_03]: people the the traits that the product
has, they will change all their labeling
[SPEAKER_03]: without change, without changing the
content to the package.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, you know, all of a sudden
everybody had it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody had cookies, but nobody had
cookies.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and that's the same thing with this
gold, except back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we were stupid because it was the
70s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, you could get away with
being stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people would do things physically to
the weed to try and change the color,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, putting it out in the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you want if you want to know how
to kill cannabinoids, that's that's how
[SPEAKER_03]: you kill cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right in the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stick it right out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now nobody gets high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or girdle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like they talked about that
stabbing the stem in the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All that sort of, you know, things to
stress the plant and make it make it die a
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly colorful death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you remember hanging a plant upside
down at harvest was supposed to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: more potent because the reds would run
downhill from in from the stock into the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that that old wise tale that if
you hung it upside down, the THC would
[SPEAKER_01]: spike to the top of the tops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to have the juices.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or people understood trichomes and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our answer is the question on if Santa
Marta was the first gold to hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually looks like Chiba was the first
wave of Colombians.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Santa Marta started in seventy four to
seventy five.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Santa Marta was an authentic high
level gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't have the psychedelic upper
reaches of Chiba, but it was powerful and
[SPEAKER_01]: energetic, a very up high.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than that, Santa Marta set a new
standard for beauty that pleased the
[SPEAKER_01]: physical senses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty to see with its plump blonde
buds bursting with pollen furred flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smelled delicious with the fresh,
spicy, piquant, peppery, flowery
[SPEAKER_01]: fragrance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tasted especially good, tangy,
warm and spicy.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the tongue with a fruity tinge that it
tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate when it does this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tested to its flowery freshness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some pretty good descriptions
of Colombia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you guys agree with some of those
descriptions of what you saw?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, he he he dances around some
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, he hints at some of the
wood or incense type traits that are
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an amazing combination with you know,
the buttery, hashy, citrusy kind of tangy,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think is what I read a word he used in
some of these articles.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, still got that to have those
kind of high notes mixed with the earthy,
[SPEAKER_03]: wooden, incency stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes it very hard hitting as a
combination, you know, incense with with
[SPEAKER_03]: citrus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can can really can really deliver the
goods.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, being 45 years ago, I can't really
tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it would be a stretch,
but I'm sure it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you think it was hashy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you think it was hashy tasting?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I wouldn't call Santa Marta hashy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe those those blacks, the blacks
from Colombia could go that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even even the wacky weed or the candy
bar my friend had, though you had to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: it like it was hash, it didn't smoke like
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It it was well, I'll take that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be equivalent to smoking hash in
a joint because my friend in Tempe used to
[SPEAKER_00]: roll joints out of hash that he crumbled
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were little pin joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: But boy, they were potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't remember this being at all,
Santa Marta being at all hashy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a delicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, you know, it was it was an up high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's what was so special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Haken was similar at the beginning,
just a super space shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you just went up higher and
higher, kind of psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's where they applied the
word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Psychedelic to some weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though at the time, most of us were also
experimenting with psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of hard to decide when we
were accurate and when we weren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a new interesting one, it says a
promising new entry in 77, for instance,
[SPEAKER_01]: was the Manizales Black.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you guys ever heard of this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not by that name, but I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's that at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that map of the Cauca, I think it
was on in that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can look at on my desktop here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think Manizales was one of the
lowland West Coast areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bring up a quick Google view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Mexican there for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Haken tops and right here is a
picture of the Chiba for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, this has been brought up
a lot lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Chiba, the Chaco Chiba, I guess maybe
some seed companies are playing with
[SPEAKER_01]: purported Chiba.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is what it actually looked like
documented back in 1979.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chiba right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: As best we know, it's the real Chiba
anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a real name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the thing is, like I was trying to
remind people, I'm not sure about it this
[SPEAKER_01]: time, but later on, high times would use
pretty much any picture they wanted to and
[SPEAKER_01]: insert it and just put a name on top of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that did happen when they didn't have
a picture handy for something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times, especially during the
80s and 90s and on into the 90s,
[SPEAKER_01]: it became standard practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at like some of the chem dog
pictures, like the pictures of chem dog
[SPEAKER_01]: over the years are not even related to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just stock photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but I think during this time,
these probably are not stock photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, that'll walk in.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's that looks legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when it came out thinking,
yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks it sounds like during the
summer of 76 was the big drought,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the first real hit of drought in the
United States and just getting really
[SPEAKER_01]: crappy weed was coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's one thing that people get
confused about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't understand that the United
States was not just this one monolithic
[SPEAKER_03]: market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so even though high times writes about
it that way often, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just a much better story to just
tell, tell intimately what's happening
[SPEAKER_03]: right there around you, you know,
instead of saying, I think it might be dry
[SPEAKER_03]: in Tucson.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, yeah, you know,
talk about where you are as if that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: center of the world and everybody else
will kind of ride along with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, the market was divided up
into, you know, thousands of little micro
[SPEAKER_03]: markets that you just, you know,
one place you could get one thing all the
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another place, you know, they would kill
to have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they've got everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just you can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: People today, they get really confused
when they read this old stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They think, you know, that's that was
America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: America's too big.
[SPEAKER_03]: For that, for that to be, you know,
it's this is just a tiny little snapshot
[SPEAKER_03]: of and it's accurate, you know,
for for for that moment in time and that
[SPEAKER_03]: place.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's America's big place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was probably accurate for New
York, which is where they thought the
[SPEAKER_01]: center of the world was at high times,
like notoriously, you know, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the group of the 20 most famous
potheads in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: With everybody bringing them all their
best shit on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ed Rosenthal is referenced here.
[SPEAKER_01]: According to the grass growing expert,
Ed Rosenthal, the longer grass lies around
[SPEAKER_01]: the greater the disintegration of the high
inspiring cannabinoids into the crater
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids cannabidiols.
[SPEAKER_01]: The latter, according to Rosenthal,
give us confused, sleepy, dizzy,
[SPEAKER_01]: fuzzy undertone that undercuts the clarity
of the cannabinoid highs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're talking about early CBD and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people say CBD is sleepy
and all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it degrades, it turns to CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manizales is straight west of Bogota.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Colombians coffee growing region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's seven thousand feet elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manizales black would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably pretty potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: High elevation, probably really dark black
weed from the from the weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I always wanted to go down there
and visit my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was the kidnap capital of the world
at that time and into the 90s even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Mexico took over as the kidnap come.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were an American, there was
someone who was always willing to grab you
[SPEAKER_00]: because someone would care about you
enough to pay money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just I just couldn't see doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say they would have gotten all your
stickers, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They confiscated them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right here, he says since Amelia is the
surfer girl of dope, missing the wild
[SPEAKER_01]: trippy exoticism of the best imported weed
and the soaring cerebral central reaches
[SPEAKER_01]: of Thai and Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess when he's referring to since
Amelia here is just a general term for
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like homegrown without seeds,
even local homegrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like based on what he's writing
around here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so one thing one thing you pick
up from that, you know, he's talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: basically it just doesn't have legs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have the depth of power and
complexity and effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, that's honestly those first
couple of years when when domestically
[SPEAKER_03]: grown weed was taking over that market,
there was a lot of stuff that didn't that
[SPEAKER_03]: was harvested before it was mature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you read what he says,
you know, it's kind of like this this
[SPEAKER_03]: empty headed surfer girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get high and then you're not high and
it's over.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's think about it for a
second.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is these are new growers,
their first crop or two, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: harvested early.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks good, but it's not packing the
full punch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not because of genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was because of, you know, growers
learning how to deal with those with,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, how to produce the product that
their customers really want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, in their area, I mean,
they were the pioneers of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't like there was tons of books
or tons of resources to go learn how to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow this properly or when to harvest or
any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also new at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was, you know, just,
you know, bring it to maturity is is not
[SPEAKER_03]: easy, especially when, you know,
this is before the full Indica invasion
[SPEAKER_03]: took place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was still a lot of highly worked
hybrids that were just barely getting it
[SPEAKER_03]: done before with a frost, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It mentions even Congolese black here,
which I'm kind of surprised there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: something called Tanganyika green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never heard of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never heard of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some kind of African grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the forums that I've been on,
there was a fellow from Namibia and he
[SPEAKER_00]: sent me some seeds from the country just
north of him, Angola, and they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been growing weed there for Angola
red is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never grown them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's supposed to be pretty potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that the Lamar Negra Angola red you
got?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's it's actually from a fellow who
lives in Namibia and got them himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Namibia is famous for the the the this
like it's sort of like the lost coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sand dunes that come down to the
ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the longest time, it was closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was closed to people because diamonds
washed up onto the shores that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: released from certain certain geological
structures under water or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's he got on himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who Lamar Negra Mustafunk talked a
bit about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another whole show in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a very well admired guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think I think there may be for
people who are really anal about things
[SPEAKER_01]: being either pure or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where some of the fuzziness comes
in with Lamar Negra.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he did do some cool stuff,
at least a lot of cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this this the whole thing about
the Tanganyika green there and Congolese
[SPEAKER_03]: black and all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, sometimes you read are and it's
like he it's like he's a travel
[SPEAKER_03]: journalist, you know, telling you about
these far off, you know, vistas and
[SPEAKER_03]: castles and, you know, raging rivers of,
you know, far flung, fantastic places.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's he's he's a storyteller.
[SPEAKER_03]: He really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, he understood the power of
evoking this sort of exotic life of
[SPEAKER_03]: adventure around all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was he was he was creating a legend.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for that about all the all the
adventurous stuff people were doing out
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was probably taking a lot of exotic
license with with the stories he told.
[SPEAKER_03]: But man, I mean, what a what a job he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, great wordsmith.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, look at the different generations
he's inspired just sitting here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like many years separate us,
you know, and if not so was here,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a whole nother generation,
you know, in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and to this day, he's still inspiring
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how easy he will be or won't
be to get a hold of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do hope that somehow someone shows him
this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, his name's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can easily find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name's Ron Rosenbaum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anybody does know him and can get in
contact with the author, Ron Rosenbaum,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to speak to all of us would.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, maybe this is our our way to
reach out to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, huge fan of our and, you know,
the idea of of getting him on the show
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, getting us to tell stories
about what his life was like at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, what I mean, because he was
so far ahead of his time as far as
[SPEAKER_03]: lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, geez, man, half the
people on Instagram are basically telling
[SPEAKER_03]: their own stories, basically like he was
telling the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of a generation of outlaws.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Influencer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, you know, viral marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like, you know, skateboarding did in
the 70s for, you know, for that sport.
[SPEAKER_03]: This he was kind of like this did the same
thing for of any of anyone like I know Sam
[SPEAKER_01]: beats his drum and stuff, but I think this
dude probably inspired quite a few more
[SPEAKER_01]: people than Sam did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, I mean, honestly, yeah, with this
position.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with you there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a counterculture hero and a kingmaker
and, you know, the the scribe of of an
[SPEAKER_03]: era.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was I I'm trying to hold back on,
you know, my praise for the guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we can get him on, that would be
the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: What an honor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I wanted to ask you,
remember, I wanted to ask you about what
[SPEAKER_03]: what your conversations with Neville were
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back during those Mr. Nice days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we don't have to do it this time,
but I'm writing it down for the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that would be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just from a personal, you know,
here I am talking with, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the real king of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: No bobblehead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, just like he's another guy,
you know, we share this passion and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember I remember the first time he
responded, it was on the actual forum and
[SPEAKER_01]: it was just like him chiming in a little
bit and responding to me directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember that fucking it's it's it's
not so nerdy to say it now, but I got this
[SPEAKER_01]: like exhilarating feeling in my chest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, I just I just spoke to the
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude responded to me, you know,
like it was that really special feeling
[SPEAKER_01]: where.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I and for me, I had spent a lot
of my my early career as you saw,
[SPEAKER_01]: like rubbing a lot of people the wrong way
with how I approached everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be able to get a response from
someone like that and for him to take me
[SPEAKER_01]: seriously, not only that, take the time to
talk to me and then to have some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: form of respect and admiration for each
other and become peers was probably one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the most special moments of my life at
that time, because I didn't feel like I
[SPEAKER_01]: earned it, but he was still giving me that
respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was special.
[SPEAKER_03]: He made he was very generous that way,
wasn't he?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never treated me like, oh, you're just
some dumb kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you how it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was never like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was one.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to know more about the American
scene, the American clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was more specifically interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while I was asking him stuff about the
old stuff that I was interested in and his
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences, he was asking me more about
Bubba Kush, Oji Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was in those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did they come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: He was more interested in chasing down the
lineages of stuff that he didn't know
[SPEAKER_01]: about and trying to trace it back to his
own work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he was he was absolutely positive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much everything that we were
covering over here by that point had had
[SPEAKER_03]: come come all go gone through his hands
and come back here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, worked and evolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not sure he's terribly wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like he might even be right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most nuts about all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the time, I thought he was a little
nuts on on a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Time has proven it to be more true than we
would have liked, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was a lot of arrogance,
to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how would you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but over time, as I talked to
him, I realized he was able to see and
[SPEAKER_01]: identify traits long before he could smell
the bud just by sight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was something I'd never seen
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone who could identify traits and
lines just through sight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a special, special talent.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people think they can do it,
but not a lot of people can do it with
[SPEAKER_01]: many, many strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be lucky if you could do that with
one strain in your life.
You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for me, it kind of made me a
little sad because, you know, the
[SPEAKER_03]: realization that so much of what's around
is directly related to his work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me sad for all the thousands of
heirlooms that got worked in the hills and
[SPEAKER_03]: the seeds never made it out to Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the diversity that I mean,
just staggering, you know, and for the
[SPEAKER_03]: longest time, I thought it confused the
hell out of me that people seemed so
[SPEAKER_03]: obsessed with, well, okay, if that's that,
then it must be this plus this plus this,
[SPEAKER_03]: as if, you know, they were, you know,
individual plants, like skunk one was a
[SPEAKER_03]: cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when everybody used it, they all used
the same thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And northern lights was a cutting and
everybody, when they used that,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was always the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but damn, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just been so much reuse and
renaming and inbreeding on inbreeding on
[SPEAKER_03]: inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just seems like so much of what we
have to work with today came straight
[SPEAKER_03]: through Neville's hands at one point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think with the resurgence of
legalization, especially in areas like
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino and Humboldt, I'm hoping
anyways, and I've seen some examples of
[SPEAKER_01]: this briefly examples that some of these
lines that didn't necessarily make it to
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville, but stayed in certain areas of
Humboldt and Mendocino and were kept
[SPEAKER_01]: worked by these guys who just wanted
nothing to do with being in public.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those do still exist and being
passed to their protegees, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: as they're as they're going to their next
destination in spiritual journey,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, before that, some of them have
passed it to the protegees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I know Tom Hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you would consider probably a mentor
type is recently talking about giving him
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of the stuff, you know,
stuff that was used to make like PTK,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a lot of those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be interesting,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are little little sections,
little treasure chests out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's way far fewer between
than we could ever want or anticipate,
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like over time, Neville
really was the time capsule to save a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of this stuff, because it's the only way
we still have a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And look, if it does become available,
it's going to be crossed with cookies and
[SPEAKER_03]: OG and cam and instantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just that I sometimes I get depressed
when I think about what's been lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I look around and see what we've
got right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's pretty fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the idea that there could
be some of those treasures out there,
[SPEAKER_03]: like what you're talking about,
just just waiting to pop up again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to stay optimistic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, maybe maybe it'll happen in
my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been waiting a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of this stuff to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we got treasures like you and
Madjag popping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything's possible, guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: With a with a mustache like Madjag's for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we pretty much go anywhere with a
mustache like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It opens every door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you guys want to get anything in
before we sign off?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did not so dog get his handle not so
dog?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was going and meeting up with a
friend to buy some chem dog weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his friend was showing him some of the
bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he looked at it and goes, this is not
so dog, bro, because they used to refer to
[SPEAKER_01]: chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: His dog is like this is not so dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just kind of stuck with him after
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how he actually got his thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oddly enough, it was at a really
well-known rest stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's a hidden part of the
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rest stop action.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I'm pretty sure that's the joke
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got anything, Raho?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, just, you know, always a pleasure
to be a guest here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, thanks for your interest,
Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, it's always a pleasure to have
you two with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yeah, next round, we'll get into it
further.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully I'll do a little more setup
so that I don't leave it all on you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll have some microphones,
too, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brand new microphones should be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be styling with new
microphones.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, we're going to sign
off.
