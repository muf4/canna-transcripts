[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeder Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's everybody doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeder Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to go and talk about the
sequel to what we were discussing last
[SPEAKER_01]: episode, which was the early years of the
Dutch seed bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, kind of last year we,
or last last time, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: we chatted a lot about how they got
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: We chatted about Neville and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of, we kind of took us,
took everybody through like the first
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I see that there's a bunch of
cool questions this week that have already
[SPEAKER_00]: popped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get to that in a little bit,
but we're going to kind of start on we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to kind of start and take you guys
through like the last, say like 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: or so of Neville's influence and kind of
his history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we got a bunch of notes and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll hold up some stuff on occasion to
give you guys some ideas, all that,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, probably the easiest way to
start is to say that in 1990, in 1988,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was kind of when Neville had been in
business, like three years or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when he kind of started to sort
out like favorites among amongst what he
[SPEAKER_00]: had.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had had to he'd collected a number of
cuttings from America by then.
[SPEAKER_00]: He dealt with a bunch of breeders by then.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had bred with a number of these things
for three or four years in some cases at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where his collection started to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: From sort of a hodgepodge grab bag of
things to more of the famous stuff that we
[SPEAKER_00]: all became familiar with when we started
getting into weed history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lights One, Northern Lights Two,
G-13, you know, Hash Plant, NL,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, NL Hazes and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 88 to 90 is kind of really when people
are probably like more familiar with that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he, you know, he's he'd sort of
settled on what worked for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where before he'd been just kind of
playing around with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really didn't know what he'd had.
[SPEAKER_00]: People had sent him stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: People had bought things off various
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, you know, but these are just names
to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: To us, you get NL, you get Maple Leaf,
you get Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all means something because there's a
lot of history behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But probably to him, there was just a lot
of they were just literally names.
[SPEAKER_00]: From dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, early on, he was sourcing a lot of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And later on and over those three years,
he became a breeder as opposed to just
[SPEAKER_01]: sourcing and passing on genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually started working lines,
which is which is where these amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: lines come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he and he had done a bunch of breeding
and he sort of figured out what was an
[SPEAKER_00]: inconsistent pain in the ass, for lack of
a better term, and what was consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Neville was always he was always
sensitive to what people wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he wanted to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to make people happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people weren't happy a lot of times
with incredibly variable stuff that didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: perform well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he, you know, he had started to
figure out what males were good to use
[SPEAKER_00]: repeatedly, what females were champs and
with lots of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to we're going to start
kind of, you know, walking through some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to start with first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should start with we kind of
talked a lot about northern lights last
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was probably one of the things that
we expounded upon the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we could chat about because 1988
is when things dramatically changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that regard, from 85 to 87,
he just sort of sold a variety of weird
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids of northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you kind of got you just bought
straight and now northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a grab bag of all the different
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, by by 88, he had decided that there
was two lines that really made the most
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And L1 and L2.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And L1 was sort of like a broadleafed
Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly you could call it a bubba type,
you know, widely frosty golf ball type,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, nugs, almost maybe slightly
yellowish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was probably one of his most
consistent lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had because he took all the northern
lights and he bred them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in 88, he offered what was called
NL1 F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And NL2 F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could put these up on the screen,
but I can't because I don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just have to read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just have to read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so basically, you know, those two
things, they became and we'll talk about a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these kind of became like mainstays in
cannabis for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They became permanent additions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as that, as well as offering them
pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's figure he gets them in 80,
84.
[SPEAKER_00]: He starts messing around with them in 85
ish by 88.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd had, you know, three years of having
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd taken them to F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was releasing them as a more
consistent variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the for 88 is the first is the
first year that those two things pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also the first year that you
start seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to offering both of those
strains as straight itself, you start
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing NL2 and NL1 being used as breeding
males in all kinds of stuff that he had.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: NL1, there's probably nothing that he used
as much as a breeding male as NL1.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest one, biggest focus on the
company is a male overall, looking back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would say so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can you can look at stuff and,
you know, a lot of the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the stuff that he had,
you know, that he got his cuttings,
[SPEAKER_00]: for instance, like hash plant,
hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He first offered his hash plant by NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets big, but as a cutting,
he offers it as big bud by NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he gets he gets a variety of
things and he starts crossing it by NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: 88 is interesting, too, because,
you know, he had gotten these old haze
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from Sam Skunkman and in addition to
some other people in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 88 is the first year that any kind of
haze hybrid pops up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one that maybe a lot of people
haven't heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's haze by NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was only offered for one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's unique about it is that all the
other haze hybrids he offered used haze as
[SPEAKER_00]: a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: This actually was a female that he found
that he called haze B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this one year where all of a
sudden you could get haze B by NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of all things, it was NL1 Ruralis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first time that haze pops up
that I'm aware of in a catalog in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's that's I do think you're
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was because he hadn't settled on
yet, you know, he was still experimenting
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit, but he'd figured out some
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had also he'd gone to America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had acquired through Jorge
Cervantes connections in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest, in the Oregon, Washington area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jorge had hooked him up with some unknown
growers and those unknown growers gave him
[SPEAKER_00]: G13 and what became known as the Pacific
Northwest Hash Plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those things ended up getting used
pretty extensively in future years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, he he also I don't know if I
don't know if Matt can show it or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he the 87 update.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he offered this 87 update.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that was cool about
Neville is that he he gave a lot more data
[SPEAKER_00]: on what the hell he was doing versus most
other breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was extensive, especially in that 87
update.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really like more data than most
growers back then would have even given a
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm glad he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: He he lays it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, he he starts talking about it
and he talks about basically both the Hash
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant and the Big Bud that he crossed to
NL one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he took that and he back crossed
it mails of that back to the original.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how he became that's how Big
Bud and Hash Plant actually got offered is
[SPEAKER_00]: as separate strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used NL one to BX them for you know,
he so so they're actually you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he never had seed lines of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and he lays out like extensive detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't show it to you on the screen right
now, but he kind of lays out like his like
[SPEAKER_00]: step by step how he figured it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of he knows we're going to be in
it, what you could look for all that type
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's when 88 is when a lot of
that's when a lot of the famous stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: we all know of really pops up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The G13 Hash Plant, I think, pops up that
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, he, you know,
he found some of these some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica strains, these, you know,
he some of these Indica strains were a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more consistent than what he was working
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once you find consistency,
you start crossing them to different
[SPEAKER_00]: things and you start, you know,
you start getting these various hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 8990 is really when like he
solidified the sort of the lineup,
[SPEAKER_00]: as it were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that lineup ended up staying pretty
consistent in in the seed bag catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even going into sensei, a lot of that
stuff ended up getting getting ported
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could kind of look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're thinking about it,
and that way, I would say probably by the
[SPEAKER_00]: late 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the three most consistent females
that he used were an L5 G13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Hash Plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those are sort of the three most
common Indicas that he would use as
[SPEAKER_00]: standard females.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hash Plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the PNW Hash Plant cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still looks very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: After all these years, they still look
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be perfectly honest about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that by modern standards, not
particularly pretty nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as males go by 8990,
you would say that the most common males
[SPEAKER_00]: he used was, like I said before,
was certainly NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also used NL2 a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had Northern Lights 5 by Northern
Lights 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had G13 by NL2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had all kinds of stuff by NL1.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian Indica was by NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Bud was by NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash Plant was by NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That haze I spoke about was by NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll answer one quick question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it coming on the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People talk about the Airborne and the
Pacific G13 cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a little hazy, but it's most
likely they're not pure G13.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're most likely a G13 by NL2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that would be phenyl popping out of
the seeds the Airborne popped from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pacific is a lot different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one has a lot more of a cloudy
history.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know the breeders that offered it and
stuff, but it never quite panned out the
[SPEAKER_01]: same as Airborne as far as producing
quality and stuff similar to G13.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then aside from NL1 and NL2,
the other probably two most common males
[SPEAKER_00]: that he used by 8990 would have been the
haze male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which haze male?
[SPEAKER_00]: The haze C.
[SPEAKER_00]: The haze C.
[SPEAKER_00]: The haze story, we could probably talk
about it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could brush up on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brush on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could brush on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sam Skunkman flees America and he comes
over to Europe and he's trying to get set
[SPEAKER_00]: up and he has skunk one and haze seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from Mel Frank, he has Durban
poison and Afghani one seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has a couple other seed lines that
he collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: California orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was from Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, was that from Rob?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a number of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he had a number of things from
Rob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob followed him out later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early pearl, early girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The early girl, the you know, the pearl
stuff, early pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the Mexicans that that Neville
offered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were from Sam initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were from sourced by Rob.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were from Rob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so Sam ended up coming over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam ended up coming over to to Europe
first in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kind of brought a hodgepodge of various
collectors and and people's lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so, you know, there's there's a
there's a debate between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not a debate anymore because
Neville's passed, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was a long debate that was
likely never to be solved where Sam has a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of stories about the early haze and
how it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville has his own stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be an entire podcast in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But suffice to say that when Sam came over
to Europe, he sold some haze seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sold some haze seeds to the founder of
SSSE.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave some to the owner of Positronix
and maybe someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there was a few people, at least at
least three people are documented to have
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten stuff from some from Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he came over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's been pretty well done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Sam, so Neville, Neville, Neville
story just real quick is there were a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of old seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He cracked a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them did not pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he the first female he got,
he unfortunately killed because it never
[SPEAKER_00]: finished flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a huge pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got another female, which is the bee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I spoke about, which I spoke about
earlier as being the first actual release.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got two males, A and C.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both ended up becoming kind of
famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: C much more so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, he, he crossed, he crossed the A
to basically everything, every good indica
[SPEAKER_00]: he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he made a mistake with his workers in
89 and he lost the male early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never, he never sold, he never sold any
commercial, uh, he never sold any
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial seed of A.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody, everybody that, um,
that gets NL five haze or any of that
[SPEAKER_00]: other kind of haze crosses, silver haze,
all that it's all using the C male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's the one that survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and strangely, um, it seems like
Neville had more success finding fire and
[SPEAKER_00]: the haze seeds that he got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than other people did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and it sounds like he had 10 seeds
total is what it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he, so there's debate in that and
there's camp that believes that he got
[SPEAKER_00]: similar things to everyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just had better Indicas to cross
them to than anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another camp that thinks that,
um, Neville claimed that Sam sold him old
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that he said would have a low
germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rate that were from 69 to 70 and maybe
Sam, and that maybe Sam, when he first got
[SPEAKER_00]: there, sold some original stuff before he
did his open pollinations in Holland and
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that got a hold of that
original first batch of haze that he
[SPEAKER_00]: brought over with him got better quality
haze than people did later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's not really a debate that we can
solve being that it's two dudes from 1984
[SPEAKER_00]: and 1985.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and they disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, but we do have, you know,
all three guys that he, that, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville and the, you know, the guy from
SSSC and the positronics gentlemen,
[SPEAKER_00]: they all agree that they got haze seed
from Sam at the same time, at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time, same year, same time, same bag,
everything, all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we know, you know, we have,
we have, we have documentation from others
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that certainly happened.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's when, um, by 80,
by 89, 90, that's when all the famous
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff you start hearing about,
which is NL five by skunk one and by two G
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 by NL two, um, you know, and L five by,
I think NL five by haze was actually
[SPEAKER_00]: released via catalog, not until 18,
89, 90.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a pretty picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just looking earlier and it's NL
five.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, I think it's a much prettier
picture than on the back of a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: catalogs that they show where it's just
like a jumbled up close shot of some kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of frosty leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is a much better, I think it
gives a much better picture of the bud
[SPEAKER_01]: structure overall growth patterns and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really interesting, uh,
because that's the famous NL five cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a, uh, I'll answer a quick question
just cause I was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just asked where's Tom Hill's
haze fits in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, I would say that,
uh, Matt knows a bit more about that than
[SPEAKER_00]: I, but I believe that Tom Hill got his
haystack from positronics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's the old positronics haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I think it's the old
positronics haze 19 based on all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that's where, um, Tom Hill's haze
comes from one of the, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the, one of the first people that
gave haze to, um, positronics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and let's see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lost my train of thought for a second
answering that question, but the NL five
[SPEAKER_00]: that he was just holding up, maybe we can
talk about that for a second because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville there's, we're talking about on
the previous podcast, how there was always
[SPEAKER_00]: two famous cuttings of five, um,
on the interview that Matt did with uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg Seattle, Greg of Northern lights
fame.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that he got a cutting of NL five
and it was from his friend, Herbie,
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Murphy's Afghan and crossed it to a
Colombian Mexican.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the cutting that he sent
Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville claims he got that cut and he
didn't like it very much compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cut that he found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville story is that he popped a bunch of
NL five seed lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's one of the lines he got from
Greg and most of it was an Indica sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was particularly useful, but he got
this one plant that was what he called the
[SPEAKER_00]: throwback plant that looked pure Afghan
and had no influence of sativa whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you see this short stocky,
dense, budded, frosty picture,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say leads up to, um, to Neville's,
you know, Neville's story being correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and probably having some truth to it
because I would look at that thing and I
[SPEAKER_00]: would not say it had any Colombian or
Mexican influence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would instantly say that looks pure
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would look like a pure Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, and, uh, so yeah,
I mean that right there, that's the famous
[SPEAKER_00]: NL five haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the famous cutting that got crossed
a haze that got crossed the skunk one that
[SPEAKER_00]: got crossed in Northern lights too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's really, you know,
we mentioned it before, but there was
[SPEAKER_00]: never a pure seed line of NL five offered.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was hybrids, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was only hybrids offered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, uh, that's the cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That discusses the NL five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to go into maple leaf Indica,
the big bud stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did we cover that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we covered that too,
too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically once he, once he found that NL
five cutting, um, like I said before,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when he started crossing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became one of his standards in the,
in the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, you know, he had, you know,
like he crossed it to skunk one that
[SPEAKER_00]: became an extremely famous strain,
uh, five by skunk one and L five haze is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the most famous line he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And L five by two is also super famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so, you know, he, and L five,
G 13 hash plant, those became sort of his
[SPEAKER_00]: standard indicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: His, his, his best producing females,
uh, skunk one haze and L two and NL one
[SPEAKER_00]: became his most common, um, males that he
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he offered, obviously he never offered
a pure NL five line or a pure,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, haze line, but he did offer pure NL
one pure L two pure skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I never got to ask him why
the Y of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why didn't you ever offer haze,
haze peer or NL five here?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think, I think part of the
reason why he never offered a haze here is
[SPEAKER_00]: because he, he screwed up early on and he
lost too much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talked about later on wishing that he
could, um, that he could cross the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that he would have been able to cross
the B to the A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, you know, but he, he lost the B
early, um, cause he didn't realize what he
[SPEAKER_00]: had.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lost the A on an accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he sort of ended up with,
uh, he sort of ended up with not very
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like his most consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have left?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and then strangely it seems
like for whatever reason, all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: people that got haze, nothing much came of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter how much breeding or crossing
they did, nothing became famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the later Neville hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like when I was going to, when I was
going to coffee shops, uh, coffee shops
[SPEAKER_00]: were, um, you know, they were full of,
of C five, which is, uh, NL five,
[SPEAKER_00]: he C eight, which is NL five haze a,
uh, a G 13, which is G 13 haze a they all,
[SPEAKER_00]: they all sort of had a G 13 haze C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were full of network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they didn't really carry much posse
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't carry any Sam work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't carry any of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, even though they were easily
accessible, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were standard people in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, there must've been a significant
quality difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to have been, um, and you know,
I think even today is there, is there a
[SPEAKER_00]: famous Sam cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a famous, uh, you know,
it's all the stuff that they do is not
[SPEAKER_00]: really all the stuff that they do is,
is all the stuff that's ordered over
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is, um, you know, is, uh, what you might
call it Neville cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and right now I just want to
take the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If any of you older judge gentlemen were
watching this and have all these cuts,
[SPEAKER_01]: give me a, give me a ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to just to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be able to chat about them and get,
and get further histories on a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of this stuff, you know,
one thing that should be mentioned about
[SPEAKER_00]: this is, uh, all this stuff happened on a
different continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what, uh, the story sounds
pretty straightforward and simple right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, but the amount of talking and time
and energy and interviewing people and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to make sure that like,
it's not just one person's opinion and
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can get other people to back up
opinions on this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a long time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, me and you have been working
steady on this for, I want to say three
[SPEAKER_01]: years now, just me and you together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've done our work on our own,
obviously, but like we have been pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: hard on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's taken a long time to even get up
to this point to be able to say any of
[SPEAKER_01]: these things positively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, when we say I'm positively,
uh, most of what we're saying is generally
[SPEAKER_00]: accepted generally accepted fact for now,
like he said, if there's some old timers
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever with some secret information
out there, that's not well known,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of this history is oral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these old guys have beefs with one
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them don't like one another very
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have their own egos and their own versions
of history and events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, uh, see, there's a guy right
there that just said his 70 year old
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbor has had NL two since 93.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if that's the case, uh, we would love
to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there could be pockets of these
things that survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hard part now is that for a long time,
nobody gave a shit about these,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, about these strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the information was a little bit
more verifiable because there wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody trying to claim rep or trying to
claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this joke, we call it pre pre,
um, where now ancient old, whatever has
[SPEAKER_00]: come out of the woodwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets a lot harder to weed through
who has what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I, I was talking with another
gentleman that we're, we're starting an
[SPEAKER_01]: interview with, um, and he was very
important in the Dutch seat scene and he
[SPEAKER_01]: was talking about some of his old lines
possibly popping up in the U S and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: something that happens every few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone says, I've got this stash of XYZ.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've kept, you know, Mason jars full of
every single one and done reproductions
[SPEAKER_01]: since 80 something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's hard unless you have
extensive knowledge about these old lines
[SPEAKER_01]: and have run some, how are you ever going
to tell him?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's not correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a hard situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a guy saying, you know,
there's some old school growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's pockets in America that aren't
on Instagram that aren't on, on some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these never got on the forums that live in
police States, um, that have kept their
[SPEAKER_00]: circles quite tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they don't, they might not even know
how rare or how cool some of the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been within their little circle
that they've just been growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so we still have hope every time
a bullshit artist comes up, I'll freely
[SPEAKER_00]: admit that there's a small part of me that
wishes it was true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want it to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want all the stories to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want every ancient rare being imaginable
to be accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuts and stuff like the pop up and be,
um, you know, and be available to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, sadly there's a lot of people out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just trying to make a quick buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and when you sell beans, I mean,
think about how many people have been
[SPEAKER_00]: selling beans of a roadkill skunk for the
last two or three years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I haven't seen any roadkill skunk
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to get finished flower with
roadkill skunk turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's figuring that out,
you know, and you can sell beans for quite
[SPEAKER_00]: some time before nobody, you know,
and exactly take a while before they
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that you're not finding roadkill
skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fell a lot of beans and there's people
that have dropped thousands of dollars of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, hopes and dreams, uh,
and spent months hunting and they get some
[SPEAKER_00]: floral citrus skunk one citrus skunk one
resold and skunk one slight, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: slight funk, slight, whatever,
not roadkill, not clear skunk turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's, uh, it's sad in that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, people were asking some
other stuff and, you know, we got a lot to
[SPEAKER_00]: cover, so we'll, we'll move on a bit,
but to say 89 90 is when Neville really
[SPEAKER_00]: established most of the strains that kind
of became famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when they all started popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when they all started popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when he'd sort of figured out what
he had, what was consistent to breed with,
[SPEAKER_00]: what made sense, what lines people liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, he's had this running joke
that people would ask for the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: level of quality imaginable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if he sold them an awesome Indica,
that was a hybrid of two pure Indicas and
[SPEAKER_00]: it yielded like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bitch and bitch and moan and whine
and complain because they wanted the best
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also wanted to crush yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always been a difficulty in,
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, people want the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the greatest turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's lots of people out there in
commercial world that don't want to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that takes longer than nine or 10
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't be a pain to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want it to be larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want it to be finicky or low
heater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Massive yielding frosty, the highest
amount of turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wants 20% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the strongest, most potent weed you
can possibly imagine with crazy curbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want donkey dick buds and I want it
done in 50 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, rarely does that occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same package, sadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, a lot of the, a lot of the
famous strains that we all smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, from a production standpoint are
annoying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially at the last decade or so
it's gotten worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody would ever pick to grow cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, nobody would ever pick to grow Kush
where it's like dink, dink, dink,
[SPEAKER_00]: dink, dink nugs here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't hold themselves up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you were like a commercial
farmer in the real world, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd be looking for some kind of like
green crack, blue dream, um, type
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, solid top to bottom buds,
easy to grow, fairly fast finishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's what, from a production
standpoint, uh, and a happiness
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint, that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, um, even sour diesel,
you know, that yields pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a long time, kind of feathery,
makes a lot of D buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you mess it, it can be really larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, super tasty and it works
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burns really nice, but it's, it's not blue
dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, you know, very white or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that that's just
covered in nubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, so yeah, so, uh, the,
uh, uh, maybe we should talk about,
[SPEAKER_00]: so he created all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville was the largest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was really only two, you know,
there's other people that will claim to
[SPEAKER_00]: have seed banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensi seeds had a tiny seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Positronix had a small seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was other seed banks on Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland, but there was really only two
seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really why we're spending so
much time talking about it is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties, there was really only two seed
banks that were selling a lot of seed in
[SPEAKER_01]: America and in Amsterdam in selling to
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were the first two seed banks
that really offered worldwide sales to
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody that was willing to come to
Holland and buy them or out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: their mail order sheet and send them an
envelope with some money and a list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was super Sativa seed club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and the seed bank, which was Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Div TV seed club, uh, started a little bit
after Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it had similar things to him and had
some of their own stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but Neville was the, he was the
elephant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the big dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, he was the, he was the one selling
the vast majority of stuff that people in
[SPEAKER_00]: America were buying from Holland was
nevils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really, that's really what makes
them so important because the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the seed game is super diversified
now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He basically almost had a monopoly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's why all these strains that are
around today usually have something of
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville's in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that there's a lot of, there's a
lot of Neville work and a lot of modern
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, simply because he was the only game
and he was one of the only games in town
[SPEAKER_00]: and tons and tons of people got his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they bred his stuff into stuff
they already had in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so his stuff got blended in and,
you know, his stuff got super famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the NL five haze became a
phenomenon in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started being great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started being sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they call it the highest haze,
you know, the PIF, the church,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, this, the, that, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of massive, a massive thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the super skunk, uh, you know,
became super famous, uh, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's talked about how super skunk and
NL five haze were his two top selling
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so enormous amounts of those
seeds got sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of what, uh, maybe we can
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 90 catalog is the final catalog of
Neville's ownership of the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I have that one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that there's a couple,
there's the most famous thing that came
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the 90 catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was he released, um, super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, super skunk was, you know,
when sadly, uh, Sam did not like skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you got to say he Sam like skunk
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did not like skunk smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't like skunk aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took skunk one and he tried to breed
the skunk out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is by his own quote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has his own quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was going for more of the citrus
grapes, sweet floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: He liked those aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was going for bud structure and other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't pick the rank skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: He tried to, uh, there's still some,
I'll answer another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The silver Pearl came out as a,
as a single strain, I think in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: two years of the seed bank, uh,
88, 89 and 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He offered silver Pearl and I,
uh, quote me on the, uh, on silver Pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, it's, uh, early Pearl something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, I think it's early Pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be NL five early Pearl skunk one,
something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only see early Pearl improved in this
one and it doesn't list anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, it's something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also released a silver Pearl by
Hayes in those couple of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was called silver Hayes,
uh, at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he called it, he called it silver
Pearl by Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it got shortened to silver,
silver Hayes at Sensi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he, um, you know, there was a guy named
Jim Ortega that we'll talk about real
[SPEAKER_00]: briefly and, um, Jim Ortega, he traded
with Jim gave him Kush for garlic bud,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, uh, maple leaf Indica and Hawaiian
Indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He offered Hawaiian Indica, um,
by NL one in the last couple of years of
[SPEAKER_00]: his catalog, maybe three years of his
catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: He offered a maple leaf, um, pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that may be, uh, uh, Afghan breeder
packs, I think where you could literally
[SPEAKER_00]: buy, um, some of the original seed stock
that Jim Ortega gave him, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how amazing would that have been?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and he, um, and he offered garlic
bud as a pure strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the only thing that never really got
offered is a pure, that never really got
[SPEAKER_00]: messed with too much was Kush for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there is a thing he sold called Kush
by Kush, but he said Kush by Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: which he said he crossed his two best
cushions to, um, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his two best cushions were Kush for an
NL two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what year that one's in?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to show it, but I can't find
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say that one's in,
that one might be an 87.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's at least one of them in that 89
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how clear it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also offered skunk Kush,
which was, and so that's, that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and then, uh, um, so maybe we're
getting pretty in depth here, but maybe,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we should talk about, um,
his fame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Led to issues, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's selling millions of dollars in seed
to America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Reagan era and then the George
Bush era.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the height of the war on drugs,
large penalties, weeds, totally illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there was a situation in which a,
um, a hydro store got raided, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: from whatever reason, some kind,
some kind of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they discovered that this guy was
supplying a bunch of growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that they found money and Neville's
catalogs and they realized that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, they realized that he was selling
dollars in seed, um, to America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you notice in some of these back
catalogs, it always says that it shipped
[SPEAKER_01]: from the U S or like in the high times,
uh, ads for devil's things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would always say ship from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's interesting about that is
this isn't factual, but I believe it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think had partners that he smuggled
seeds into America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would send Neville money and
then he would communicate what you needed
[SPEAKER_00]: and they watched the seeds from within the
U S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he was pretty, um, he was
transparent about that when it was going
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result of that, that meant
that every seed batch didn't have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through customs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just had to get it through customs
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he could sell it within the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can imagine, uh, the DEA and the
government at the time took a pretty,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, poor view of that aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, operation green merchant
happens where they decide to raid,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, everyone, every growth store in the
United for the most part, they rated the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth stores in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a big push.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, Neville gets caught, I believe in
Australia and he gets busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and he ends up spending it a good
amount of time in jail, better part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so that, you know, we're not going
to this, this, this particular episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not going to talk very much about
SSC because we're going to save that for a
[SPEAKER_00]: different time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but what that did is that sort of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, um, led to a domino effect of sorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a domino effect of sorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, uh, super sativa seed club decided to
stop, um, because they saw what was going
[SPEAKER_00]: on with Neville and it was pretty serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville was already in, was obviously in
jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, this gave an opportunity for
others who had seen how, how Neville and
[SPEAKER_00]: the super sativa seed club were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It left a void in Amsterdam, uh,
in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still, it was legal at that time,
obviously to produce seed for,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, pretty seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the only places in the,
in the world where it was totally legal to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce cannabis seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, Neville was sitting in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he was fighting extradition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want to extradite Neville to
America because, um, they wanted to put
[SPEAKER_00]: him in jail for life in prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Australia and Holland, which he was a
citizen of both didn't agree with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was stuck in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and he, um, you know, there was all of
a sudden there was no seed banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no seed banks left.
[SPEAKER_00]: It caused a bunch of, it caused a bunch of
ripple effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a whole bunch of growers in America
got busted, um, to do their relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: with various, uh, hydro stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, Greg Seattle,
Greg talked in his interview with Matt
[SPEAKER_00]: about how, by the late eighties and that
era, they had basically lost everything
[SPEAKER_00]: because of a series of rolling busts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there were heavy presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really going after people,
electricity, all this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, Sensei, which was founded by
Ben and Alan drunkers, they saw an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity and they offered to bail
Neville out of jail and, uh, give him
[SPEAKER_00]: money to help him fight his situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as he sold them their company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the invention of Sensei.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the death of the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sensei, uh, since he absorbed him and
all of a sudden went from a nobody to the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest game in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they bought, uh, they,
they bought his seat back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they start offering, um, you know,
and we actually, the Sensei 91 seed bank
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog is one of the rarest catalogs,
um, because it only was out for,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's obviously only out for one year and
it shows the merger of the seed bank with
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a much, much more limited
catalog than what they offered in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a much more limited one than Neville
was currently offering, but by the time he
[SPEAKER_00]: split.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result of that, uh,
sadly for Neville, Neville went from being
[SPEAKER_00]: the owner of the largest, most successful
seed bank in the world to the head breeder
[SPEAKER_04]: of Sensei.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He lost his company.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lost his self-control, uh, the
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hated him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and he was trapped in Holland for a
long time because the, the America wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to come steal him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got him to America and have him face
charges of life in prison for seed sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland refused to extradite him because
since seed sales were legal and he was a
[SPEAKER_00]: citizen of Holland, they were not going to
extradite one of their citizens for doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something that was legal on their own
country and to go to life in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some other country, in some other
country, he is not a citizen of other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries, not a citizen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he had his freedom, but he was stuck in
Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DEA and Interpol was after his ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he lost the biggest, most,
most, uh, famous seed company and had to
[SPEAKER_00]: give it to Ben and Alan drunkers and work
for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, didn't you lose the castle as well
at that point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lost the castle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was a number of projects he had
that when he was in jail, never saw the
[SPEAKER_00]: light of day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was putting on releasing a,
uh, NL five seed line in 90, in 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he had taken the NL five cutting that
Matt showed earlier and he had BX'd it
[SPEAKER_00]: like eight times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he used NL one, like I said,
with everything, uh, he'd be exited eight
[SPEAKER_00]: times and he was planning on releasing it
in, um, 1991 and it disappeared.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That project disappeared and never got
released again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was some things, uh,
somebody asked if they could see it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_04]: The NL five?
[SPEAKER_04]: The NL five.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, so, so obviously that sucked for
Neville, uh, spending a good 10 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jail is no fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jail foods, no fun being in, in,
in, you know, concrete jungle holds no
[SPEAKER_00]: fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he's no fun.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your company's no, I mean, yeah,
it's like, basically they were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we'll do you a solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you out of jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you back to Holland,
but we want your shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: By a minor competitor at that someone that
wasn't even close to the level.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, since he wasn't even close to where
super city VC club or they were nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're sitting in jail and your
options are keep sitting in jail or have
[SPEAKER_00]: these sort of, uh, uh, greasy Dutch
businessmen, uh, offer to get you out and
[SPEAKER_00]: get you home and give you some money and
buy your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds real good at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he chose the get out of jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, card, but then he lost
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, that was sort of the start
of, you know, by the time that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Matt, Matt can speak to this a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got to communicate quite a bit with
Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've chatted with him a number of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt had a much longer back and forth with
him, uh, much later in his career.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounded super dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, I just mean that, you know,
I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: They communicated a lot more over a lot
more months, a lot more directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, you know, I met him through other
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to go to Holland quite a bit to get
seeds and I ended up meeting them a few
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a young guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like I had some kind of,
uh, you know, massive, uh, information
[SPEAKER_00]: dump from Neville to myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wasn't interviewing him or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little shell shocked, uh,
meeting somebody like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but you know, Matt can attest
that, uh, that was sort of the start of
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's bitterness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, uh, things Neville paid more
of a price than most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, uh, spreading seeds for overgrowing
the government for that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and if you look at it, like he was
owed the most for doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, he felt like most people
lived off the back of his work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not necessarily incorrect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, he never, yeah, he never got,
um, he never, he never got to reap the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits as much of his work as other
people did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, his life got burned down on any number
of different occasions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be said, you know, this is kind of a
personal part, not, um, not, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the greatest thing to talk about with
Neville, but he was a hero.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's actually the reason why he went
from Australia to Holland was uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you know, he was getting,
he was, uh, heavily addicted in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties or he was getting treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so I'm sure, um, that some of his
life issues were certainly self-inflicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you struggle with addiction
like that, your life is, um, your life is
[SPEAKER_00]: tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have, you have, you have ups and
downs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you have issues, you know,
you, you probably wasn't the easiest
[SPEAKER_00]: person to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: He probably had moods, major mood swings,
major mood swings, you know, better days
[SPEAKER_00]: than others, better months than others
type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and then on top of that,
that like, you know, a lot of times really
[SPEAKER_00]: talented people, um, sometimes they're
paying the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so people, talented people can
be very hard to communicate with.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but what I will say about Neville that
was different than most people is that
[SPEAKER_00]: most Dutch which is some, which is
different than a little bit in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly there's lots of people in
America that are just like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, in, he was probably one of the
only Dutch that really loved the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: really did things as far as the famous
Dutch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not making a big general statement
about everybody, but as far as like the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the Dutch are pretty famous for
being extremely business oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll, they'll tell you the truth as
much as it helps their bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it doesn't help their bottom line,
they could give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville was extremely open about lines
and strains and what he used and how he
[SPEAKER_00]: did it, what he did it with and where he
got it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nobody in the Dutch scene that we
know more about who he got strains from
[SPEAKER_01]: and what he did to create strains,
all everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of other seed banks in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have zero interest in telling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had decades to tell you they don't
care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few that might be popping up
that, that, uh, are, are, are pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I wanted to make a qualifier
because he's by no means is the only one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are plenty of, you know,
and that's the sad thing is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, Ben, uh, the drunkers are
still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A terrible interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care about history.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's not their interest at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will tell you to this day that they
have every original plant known to man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feed with all the same plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still make their own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still make their own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even been verified by any number of
different sources that they outsourced it
[SPEAKER_00]: to Spain sometime ago.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they lost a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you can't get actual history out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville, Neville cared while he had the
seed bank, he gave a bunch of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was honest about when he lost certain
strains popped up on Mr. Nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, long time later in like Oh nine,
uh, 10, 11 era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of questions pretty directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the drunkers and sensei are a black
hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't tell you shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Major black hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know that they even know shit
to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think there's some, obviously they
do and they were part of, but I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: that they would have any kind of knowledge
about any of the breeding going on at
[SPEAKER_01]: sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, this is, um,
so, so that's kind of, I guess we kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: segue into sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So headed into sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're headed into sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville, you know, Neville had the seed
bank, most famous seed bank created a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of his most famous strains gets busted,
spends much time in jail, gets bailed out,
[SPEAKER_00]: loses his company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's head breeder at sensei.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so it took some time to
transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Matt and I have spent a bunch of time
analyzing this and, um, I don't know the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way to put it, but sensei,
there was certain famous things like NL
[SPEAKER_00]: five Hayes and a super skunk that they
left alone because the name already had
[SPEAKER_00]: such great, uh, that's that, uh,
it had already been marketed under that
[SPEAKER_01]: name and was already so successful if they
didn't have a need to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually some pretty good comments
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get to them in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can eat shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so anyway, well, this is,
this is super long winded, but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why it's so important is
that the, a lot, a lot, a lot of our
[SPEAKER_00]: famous strains and our named elite cuts
from the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the things that went into the
famous cuts that we all work with today
[SPEAKER_00]: came directly from Neville's work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he was the biggest game in town,
um, probably from 1985 to the late
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he was the biggest force in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result of that, the tons of
people in America were getting his seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and, um, and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, there's stuff coming in that
people are saying that's actually pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll start chatting about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, so sensei buys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed bank and they, in my opinion,
they wanted to obscure exactly how much of
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed bank they had taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted to trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, super skunk and L five
Hayes, some of the stuff that was super
[SPEAKER_00]: famous already, they left alone,
but they were the first company to start
[SPEAKER_00]: trademarking names and cannabis,
which still goes on today and sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's still battles going on about,
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, the, I see some stuff people
are talking about early Shiva shanty had
[SPEAKER_00]: garlic, but in it, anyone remember the
early Shiva shanty that threw garlic,
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanos, uh, that type.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one of the catalogs that actually
talks about that specifically that very
[SPEAKER_01]: first catalog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just reading it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty funny in the sense that
my opinion is, is that Shiva shanty is
[SPEAKER_01]: garlic, but yeah, one of them is one of
them at one point was garlic, but you
[SPEAKER_01]: shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll try not to get too deep into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's kind of a, it's, it's kind of a
nerdy subject, but if you look at the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: bank catalogs and you look at the sensei
catalogs, um, since he ended up using a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of Neville stock photos, a lot of his
verbiage and his descriptions,
[SPEAKER_00]: just much shorter versions of them in his
catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, they, she, garlic bud
disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it becomes Shiva shanty Shiva shanty
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like a hybrid of become
Shiva shanty too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they use the same, they use a lot
of the same verbiage and describing Shiva
[SPEAKER_00]: shanty as Neville's descriptions of garlic
bud and the same picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use the exact same photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, another one that we could talk about
is NL five skunk one becomes a Shiva
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually the only one that they
changed the name that in the sensei
[SPEAKER_00]: description, they actually say it's
actually NL five skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they still leave that in the
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally in the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took it from NL five skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They called it Shiva.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd called it Shiva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that people will
probably find extremely interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or maybe, maybe not, but, uh,
Neville's NL two F three, he always
[SPEAKER_00]: referred to going back early as the NL
two, any description you can find in the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed bank catalog of any hybrids he made,
not only does he call it NL two,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he always calls it a Hindu Kush type.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Northern lights gets ported over
from the seed bank, Northern lights one F
[SPEAKER_00]: three become the Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you can actually tell because they
in the sensei catalog, they list Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: lights as a three time Indica winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: 88, 89, 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can look it up and NL one was the
Indica winner in 88, 89, 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the little tail NL two becomes Hindu
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since he changed the name, uh,
and, and NL two, they use the same
[SPEAKER_00]: picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use similar descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go back, um, even, even straight
up in certain stuff, like they,
[SPEAKER_00]: they sold a skunk Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they called it skunk one by their best
Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville sells a skunk Kush at the seed
bank and he calls it NL two by skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it the same name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the same description except for
they just call it Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NL two doesn't disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gets a different name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absorbed differently too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that there was another seed company
that stole an L two and they sold an L two
[SPEAKER_00]: is Dutch passion and they NL two under the
name Oasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NL two is sort of drops off as a name,
but it lives on in other names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of art of, uh,
that's sort of the start of, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: the rename game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all the real early rename game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just read off some renames from
the renames.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I got, I got to look away at the
camera so I can actually like see this
[SPEAKER_00]: little chart I got going on, but Neville
called it silver Pearl by Hayes,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, since he calls it silver Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, garlic bud becomes Shiva Shanti.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like, like I just said, and L one
becomes Northern lights and L two becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: Hindu Kush big skunk, which was big bud by
skunk one at the sea simply becomes sensei
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ash plant by NL one by Swazi becomes
African queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my other nickname that a lot of
people call me African queen, big bud by
[SPEAKER_00]: NL one simply becomes big bud Hawaiian
Indica by NL one simply becomes Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was really only a few of the most
famous like skunk one, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, NL five Hayes, super skunk that,
uh, that kept the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They changed everything else, but they
left us clues because they were fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of laziness, pure laziness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use the same pictures and they use a
lot of the same verbiage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they even kept the same yields and
harvest harvest times and other data that
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville included.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so they made it, so they made it,
uh, and then they tried marked those
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then all of a sudden they own the
trademarks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Shiva, like I said, Shiva Shanti,
it is garlic, but yeah, it uses the same
[SPEAKER_00]: verbiage in the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: It uses the exact same photo from Neville
catalog.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is garlic, but I had that pulled out
earlier just to show to the two side by
[SPEAKER_01]: side, but I can't remember where I put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yeah, we don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, it's, it's, we could,
we could, uh, we could go, we could go in
[SPEAKER_00]: depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to keep it relatively brief,
but the point is, is that since he was
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to obscure just how much they went
from a little company that had barely
[SPEAKER_00]: anything to the biggest company,
um, the biggest company in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, the timeline we're talking right
now, this is 1991.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is, this is early to mid
nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Nice is, I'm just answering.
[SPEAKER_00]: In question, Mr. Nice is way, way later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably won't even get to that part of
cannabis today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that didn't start early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville's working as the head breeder
for, um, for Sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not going to talk about these
companies very much, but it's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: good to mention that Neville not only
spawned Sensei seeds, but everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: working for Neville got their own ideas
and he spawned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if, uh, um, well,
yeah, somebody just posted Shiva Shanti is
[SPEAKER_00]: not garlic now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we'll get to why things aren't the
way they are anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Adam done from th seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam, Adam from th seeds, uh, Simon,
who is famous for serious seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony, who.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ended up making sag Martha.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all worked at Sensei under Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, after leaving, uh, Tony and
Simon started cerebral seeds in 1994 for
[SPEAKER_00]: one year and then split Tony made sag
Martha, uh, Simon made, um, serious and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, and, uh, uh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Adam, like I said, made THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, um, you know, so Neville working with
Neville, you know, uh, Neville sort of put
[SPEAKER_00]: all four of those companies on the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those companies would have existed if they
hadn't been able to work either for
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville under Neville, uh, Sensei bought
Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, and I think that for
most of Neville's time at Sensei,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was breeding and doing a bunch of
projects, but, uh, you look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: catalogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come out from those nineties and
those early to mid nineties period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically the seed bank catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you know, there was a few
things that Neville got rid of at the
[SPEAKER_00]: later era of the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he didn't really like Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he sold it for the first few years of
the seed bank and then he, and then he
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminated it since he brought it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was a couple other strains that,
uh, that popped up here and there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for the most part, um, since he was
the seed bank continued and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: they, they absorbed all of his history.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they started claiming care from
85.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started the originator of all these
various strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sort of like, you know, since they
bought it, they bought all the history
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Neville was working for some,
uh, some Dutch businessmen that he didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: really like.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it ends up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so he worked for Sensi and we can,
since, since nothing much changed from the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed bank to Sensi, um, we don't really
have to talk a bunch about that except
[SPEAKER_00]: for, uh, you know, I started going to
Amsterdam in, uh, 1994.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some very famous people on IG and
stuff that started going in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties and mid nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since he was one of the primary places
where we got things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, um, since he was really
Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was their head breeder still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, you know, and so,
you know, Neville from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 85 to 90 at the seed bank, and then from
91 to 95 at Sensi, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amount of super skunk and NL five Hayes,
all the NL five Hayes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Cuban black, the PIF, the Heights
Hayes, the various, the Miami,
[SPEAKER_00]: that all came from that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of, uh, you know, NL five Hayes seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he, uh, you know, they lost the G
13 cutting by Neville's own admission and
[SPEAKER_00]: about 93 was one of the ones that got sick
and died early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lost the NL five Hayes cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're 94, 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the reasons why all the best
phenos of NL five Hayes in, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, America were found sort of between 89
and 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then once the, once the mom was
lost, uh, people didn't really find the
[SPEAKER_00]: same quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, I think all the name
deletes of NL five Hayes of which there's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably eight or 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all come from that six year period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's any that come later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen any good NL five Hayes
cuttings in a long time in that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, you know, uh, so well,
maybe we'll tie a bow on the sensei thing
[SPEAKER_00]: because we've, we've kind of covered most
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, uh, the last famous thing that never
Neville did there was he was working on
[SPEAKER_00]: this hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which was NL five Hayes, uh,
or people call it C five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had this very famous mother cut that
was sold in all the coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the two of his two favorite
C five cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he was trying to play around and
make a poly hybrid and he was playing with
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing it to skunk case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wasn't really happy with where it
was yet, but Ben and Alan drunkers,
[SPEAKER_00]: being, uh, uh, businessmen, they had spent
a bunch of money and they were sponsoring
[SPEAKER_00]: the 95 cannabis cup and the cannabis cup
was all about Jack Herrera and it was all
[SPEAKER_00]: about his life and his history and his
contributions to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Ben went to Neville and said,
Hey, we want to release a Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have something that we drop at the
cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't that be a great marketing tool?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the number one sponsor of this cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're spending a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Freddie, um, as far as Neville was
concerned, but he released an L five Hayes
[SPEAKER_00]: by skunk Hayes and they called it Jack
Herrera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt we need to spend very much time
talking about Jack Herrera, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's super Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it led to Cindy 99, you know,
it led to a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was big yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a tremors dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was, it smelled like, uh,
turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's people have a, a love and hate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a lot of people have dislike for that
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jack aroma became infamous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, uh, you know, being something that
repelled people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stuff like Jack Terps and some of the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People not genuinely know what genuinely
speaking know what, uh, or generally
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking know what Jack Terps are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the first time that people ever
heard about the word turpentine long
[SPEAKER_00]: before that Terp was identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the Jack Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Terps act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack was a super high yielding,
uh, you know, strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people grew it and that was
people's first experience with extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it, it bred dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt can talk about trying to get
interesting phenols out of turpentine
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant strains that don't give you
turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very tough to breed with turpentine
anything and try to infuse that into a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of Jack Terps, train wreck Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of breeders have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have thrown their hat in the ring and
tried to breed with a lot because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: such a vigorous, powerful, high yielding
fun plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's real hard to find a not
turpentine dominant, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, um, in, in modern times though,
people are finding out that turpentine is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually really good in extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes them very flavorful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's been a little bit of a
Renaissance for the turpentine queens out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe, um, maybe since you can't see
anything, maybe we'll pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to answer some questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and figure out what questions we
need to answer and let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the number one voted thing,
and we talked about it a little was why
[SPEAKER_00]: was Sam's never able to produce a haze to
rival Nevels?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the outstanding difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the number one biggest question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, uh, I think you, you,
you've, uh, answered this before when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was talking with you about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I actually think I mentioned it mostly
a little earlier in the program,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, we don't know why Sam,
you know, Sam sold haze to positronics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bought haze from the flying
Dutchman, that was Sam's haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sold clothes of wholesale seed to any
number of brokers in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they sold it through their seed
bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for whatever reason, uh, everybody in
Holland wanted Nevels haze hybrids and
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody found anything that rivaled what
Neville was able to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and a lot of times,
uh, Caleb, uh, CSI myself, Matt,
[SPEAKER_00]: others, we always talk about like the
proof is in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants don't, uh, and whatever reason,
maybe it was sheer luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe it was Neville story is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did get earlier haze than,
than Sam produced later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe as, as been open, which is something
that I found, um, hard to believe,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be honest as a breeder is he loves haze
and, uh, he never ever made any
[SPEAKER_00]: selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just, he just said, all I did was
open pollinated to keep it as wide as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't do any selection work,
any line work on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, as a, as a breeder, never ever playing
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: With your favorite phenos from your
favorite line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems really unusual to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like me never fucking with blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but that's what he says.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can talk about this for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when you open pollinate,
that's great because you open it up wider,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that means it might be a hell of a lot
more effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so am by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeatedly open pollinating it and never
making any selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he might've open pollinated his way
into jungle weed or hemp, or he might've
[SPEAKER_00]: lost a bunch of the quality that led
people to love haze in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you look at, um, like Tom Hill says,
um, he would even say you need at least 10
[SPEAKER_01]: packs, you know, a hundred seeds to find a
single keeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, the, the repeatedly OPEing
probably didn't help anything because
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously there's so many phenotypes,
even in positronics haze that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many phenotypes that you need
to pop a hundred to find a single one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Sam has claimed that everyone got
the exact same haze and no one got any
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that a bit hard to believe because
there's lots of people that bought flying
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutchman haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of people that bought posse
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's tons of people that bought,
uh, Tom Hill haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, haze has been sold for decades in a
wide variety of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of the elites that people hoard
come from Neville stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would think that we have a lot of
quality Afghans out there and you'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to cross some pure haze to some other
good Afghans and get all the results to
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the G 13 haze and the NL five haze
and so on and so forth, no one's been able
[SPEAKER_00]: to replicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones are better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that did also have the theory that he
talked about much later on that he only
[SPEAKER_01]: believed in breeding with haze males,
that that was the key to finding the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the, the Holy grail haze was through
haze males breeding and not using them as
[SPEAKER_01]: females.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of that might be that he'd
lost the two best venos of females in the
[SPEAKER_04]: eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he ended up doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also say too, that collecting
pollen from some 18 or 20 week haze male
[SPEAKER_00]: and then dusting it on other plants when
appropriate is probably a lot easier of a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder aspect than trying to wait for a
18 or 20 week female to be the appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: time to pollinate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's something to be said for the
fact that we could collect a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen and then dump it on stuff later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much harder to breed with the girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, there's another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and Gene recently mentioned that you
and he have been doing some research and
[SPEAKER_00]: it looked like Hindu Kush could most
likely be a renamed NL.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we chatted about that already at
length.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely believe that the Hindu Kush
that was sold at Sensei is just NL too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, have I had any dealings with gypsy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and it, it was just a really bad
proposal for me to front a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that he would sit on the money
for, I want to say six months to a year,
[SPEAKER_01]: at which point he would pay you out mostly
in credit store credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would wait like almost a year to be
able to use anything from any,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was no way in fucking hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll have podcasts that deal with
gypsies era of seed banks at some other
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not necessarily a ton of him
specifically, but he's from a different
[SPEAKER_00]: era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're discussing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, outside of the work that Neville
brought to the world, who outside the
[SPEAKER_00]: original big names contributed most new
strains worth something to the culture
[SPEAKER_00]: early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mentioned some of those before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'll just associate some names with
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Sam skunk man brought, uh,
haze and skunk one to Europe, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: or popularized it to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Jim Ortega, who's a very mysterious
character, brought Hawaiian indica,
[SPEAKER_00]: garlic bud, uh, maple leaf, indica,
and cush four to Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were all used extensively in
projects and so became very famous
[SPEAKER_00]: building blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Mel Frank, uh, who's still quite well
known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: He contributed the Afghani one and the
Durban poison to things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't know if Jorge Cervantes,
uh, I don't think he directly contributed
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, but he did make the links.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he certainly connected Neville,
um, uh, growers in Oregon and Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: that led to the hash plant and G 13,
which obviously entered into a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: legendary status.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Rob Clark, who wrote marijuana botany,
uh, has she and some other really
[SPEAKER_00]: important cannabis books.
[SPEAKER_00]: He contributed a bunch of, um,
you know, California orange, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: various Mexicans, various sativa crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he's certainly brought early girl,
early Pearl type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all credited to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm trying to think of, you know,
that's sort of those, that those names
[SPEAKER_00]: right there are sort of the backbone and
the NL guys.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle Greg, certainly NL and the NL
group from the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contributed obviously all the NL
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, there's a number of people we
don't know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those guys are sort of the
foundational, um, people that brought a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of stuff that ended up not only
getting brought over there, but ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: getting used a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into a lot for NL two specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that was his.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was a guy named Herbie that
contributed the NL five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I'm sure behind all these
famous names are just like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably a group of people,
uh, or good friends and stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed various things that their
names have been lost to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if I've not so dog and Matt
could turn back time, what would you buy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, uh, I would buy everything
from the seed bank, everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: literally everything you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would buy hundreds of seeds of
everything that I could, all the Durban,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the skunk one, all the NL five.
[SPEAKER_00]: A is the app, the maple leaf mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of these things we talk about,
um, but you know, Neville was one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: few people that got to run through
hundreds or thousands of even of these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and really see what was in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about the famous phenos,
but, um, you know, uh, we were really
[SPEAKER_00]: young when these things were out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little older than you, but even
still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I was, I was only 18 in 1994
when I started going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was even sort of catching the tail
end of certain things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's see there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question was Afghan T what's
known about it, the strains it was used in
[SPEAKER_00]: geographically, what part of Afghanistan
that had come from via who, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to preface this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to preface this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these people, all these people talking
about roadkill skunk and all the other
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sincerely believe in, in just from the
work with, um, even the early Mafghany,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, uh, labor sours, the fucking super
skunk and diesel, all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sincerely believe that's the direction
of her.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are all these people chasing
different directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's fair to put it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody's on an E even playing field.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the direction I'd look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, uh, the maple leaf,
we don't, we don't know anything about GM
[SPEAKER_00]: Ortega.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know where any of the strains
that he got came from zero documented
[SPEAKER_00]: anything about he's still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's possible that he could,
um, come out and tell some stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, but it is a mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to have them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know, we know the story of his work
basically as soon as he started trading
[SPEAKER_00]: the Neville.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when he pops up and you know,
the, um, we can talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: the maple leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the maple leaf Neville's talked about
extensively, uh, when he first started
[SPEAKER_00]: growing it out, he started getting some
sweet big bud types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then he started growing more of it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he found some more like hash
plant types, some dark hashy thick types.
[SPEAKER_00]: He called those types Ortega.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then he started growing more out
and then he eventually found what he
[SPEAKER_00]: considered to skunk archetypes,
which he called Afghan T and Afghan S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it's important again,
because when most people hear skunk,
[SPEAKER_01]: they think skunk one, he wasn't referring
to skunk one types in this Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he was just kind of a little bit of
the structure, a little bit of the nose,
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of the look, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he said about it is that,
so obviously the, the maple leaf was kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a, a hodgepodge of different phenos
that popped out of Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what he found is if you took a big bud
type and you bred with it, the maple leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: big bud type bred big bud like,
you took an Ortega type, the hash plant
[SPEAKER_00]: type and you bred with it, it sort of
ended up being hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they kind of bred true to type when
they popped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bred with the Afghan T or Afghan S
it also breeded true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the T is pretty famous, uh,
in the sense that it is the mom of super
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he claims it's what put the funk in
super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what crossing it back to its Afghan,
you know, to an Afghan, the Afghan T
[SPEAKER_00]: brought out the, the, the rank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a, it took a kind of a sweet
floral skunk and made it reek.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, Afghan T is incredibly famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's probably the least well-known
thing we're going to talk about tonight as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as being incredibly famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the least well-known, but it's the
mother of one of the most famous strains
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And possibly the reason why that strain
was so hunted nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super skunk is probably one of the most
well-known cannabis strains in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and he says that that's what made it
super.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reading the Afghan T, um, Afghan T also
crossed well with Hayes and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing called Afghan Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that's supposed to be a,
uh, uh, an a maple leaf by Hayes C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard to verify obviously if that's the
case, but, uh, we have documentation from
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville that made super skunk and it,
and it crossed great with Hayes C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's kind of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's some other stuff that,
uh, I just answered the Jim Ortega
[SPEAKER_00]: question on a different one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some Mendo perp stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's pretty wide ranging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discussed garlic bud pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discussed Hindu Kush, the Friesland and
Sensi Star and stuff like that we'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: to on a different episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we'll certainly talk about those,
uh, a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, where they liked to have
been coming from the Seattle Gregg's
[SPEAKER_00]: group, uh, all that was there a Sensi NL
five line in 89.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not, uh, there was a,
uh, Sensi didn't have NL five because in
[SPEAKER_00]: 89 the seed bank was still owned by
Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and there was never a pure NL five
line offered.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there also was never a 1988 Sensi
seeds G 13 hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, do you can use the Mel Vanick's garlic
Fino of NL five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let Matt take that one if he wants
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do we know if Neville's kids have
knowledge on his father's work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: His son has some knowledge of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know his son and Neville's sister
are currently doing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any info on what Kush for is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like I said, Jim Ortega is still
alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could maybe one day expound upon that
if he likes a lot of rumor about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's rumor that the clone might exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's rumor that the clone is,
uh, is not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a, it's a night pure push.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cure pure Kush variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No two type area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I got this guy said I got to try a
maple leaf from an old timer in Georgia,
[SPEAKER_00]: Georgia, unbelievable flavor, almost like
Dr. Pepper meets roadkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that sounds, that sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when did the silver Pearl that hip
works come out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think we talked earlier,
the silver Pearl started being offered by
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville at the seed bank around 88,
89, uh, it was offered 88, 89,
[SPEAKER_00]: 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the strains that got offered
at Sensi later on as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it popped up, um, is Steve Hagar just
as guilty as Sam, the skunk man is AKA
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave Watson from operation green
merchants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's Steve Hagar.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the, uh, guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the one of the, uh, the big head
honchos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a whole podcast in itself,
so to speak, with all the rumors and
[SPEAKER_00]: accusations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of people that believe
one way and there's a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: believe another way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's a pretty in depth one.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as Sam goes, a lot of people do say
that there is something to do with federal
[SPEAKER_01]: informants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've looked up extensively.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen a damn thing come to light
for any proof of any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say Neville told me
specifically that he said, yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody knew Sam and everybody knew his
DEA handler.
[SPEAKER_01]: That walked around with them, but now also
during that time, devil was telling me
[SPEAKER_01]: that him and Sam were fucking making video
means back and forth at each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know how reliable that
information is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Sam and Neville had famous beef coming
from Neville's bust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those Kung Fu dub over video means that
they would send back and forth at each
[SPEAKER_01]: other in 2009, 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were, I wish someone still had them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, you know, there was,
um, there was, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there's a friend of ours that
mentioned black Domina.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can touch on that real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so black Domina was something that,
you know, in, in Neville's Neville seed
[SPEAKER_00]: bank era, the vast majority of the stuff
that we were talking about in the
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and this is kind of, this is kind
of the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the super city to have a seed club is
they were basically all F ones or very
[SPEAKER_00]: simple hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's kind of what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, they were crossing pure strains
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were releasing lines of pure strains
they had gotten, and they were taking
[SPEAKER_00]: these pure strains like skunk and Northern
lights or haze and skunk or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Northern lights and haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were crossing them in the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but the poly hybrid terms started to
pop where you started getting more
[SPEAKER_00]: complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flex breeding coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So black Domina was a cross of four in
because, uh, that Neville, that they
[SPEAKER_00]: released that Neville bread while he was
at Sensi and the mother was consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mother was a, one of his favorite
cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a NL one by hash plant by NL one to
say it correctly, actually, cause the NL
[SPEAKER_00]: one was the dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the mom and released three
versions of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, depending on the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the dads was, um, I believe
Afghani one by NL two.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another dad that was,
uh, Afghani one by Ortega, which is maple
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was the third and final dad,
which I believe was the vast majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds, but it's kind of hard to say
people wanted, uh, with all these pure
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica is being crossed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: People wanted a larger yielding thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he crossed that hash plant by NL
one to a, uh, garlic bud by NL two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so black Domina, uh, had three
versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, mom was always the same, uh,
dad varied as they played around with what
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a really good name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they just fucking went with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I will say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, of all my trips to Europe,
uh, I lost it sadly, but a black Dominic,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Fino I found was one of the best
things I ever got out of Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I had a great, great, great variety of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted peppery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was extremely frosty, yielded pretty
nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was dark, uh, dark Afghan,
not too leafy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I still had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super regrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we have some good friends,
um, that there was a rare 12 week Fino,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that was likely a recessive garlic bud
type, uh, that people really liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it the lady Fino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there was a lot of good black Domina
black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was probably one of the best later
things that Neville did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, uh, so I don't know, we can,
um, so we've probably been talking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how long it's been going,
but we'll, we'll hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll tie it off with, um, we'll tie off
Neville at least with sort of,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, the last phase of what he did and why
that's important to maybe, and then we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: call it good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we didn't get to everybody's
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be hard to get to everybody's
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one person said, can you describe the
different growth structures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower times yields, flavor effects,
pros and cons of the different chem cuts,
[SPEAKER_00]: chem D, chem 91, chem sis, chem four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll do a chem dog episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Won't touch that one tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I have a long history with chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I got blessed and I got to be one of
the earlier people that got ahold of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had the chem D since oh six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had the chem four for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of experience with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could do a long talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you, you'll hear more about the
chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most political episode we will ever do
probably that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, there's other ones I
think that could cause some fire,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, but we will, I promise you,
we will, we will talk extensively about
[SPEAKER_00]: chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we'll, we'll be popping out these
episodes pretty often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you'll hear about it in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so to tie off the Neville bit after
answering questions is Neville was ticked
[SPEAKER_00]: off about, uh, working under Ben and Alan
drunkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he left in 95, 96, um, and he
partnered with a younger cat named Shanti,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Shanti Baba.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't talk about him extensively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but he came to Europe in the early
nineties and he popularized white widow,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, great white shark, white rhino,
uh, things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he was also from Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a bit younger than Shanti.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sort of, um, and so when Neville left
Fancy, uh, Shanti Neville and this
[SPEAKER_00]: gentleman named Arjun partnered at the
greenhouse, uh, coffee shop, which should
[SPEAKER_00]: be pretty familiar to everybody that has
even a rudimentary knowledge of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, usually the first seeds everyone buys
post 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they, they had a very successful
seed bank and they had a very successful
[SPEAKER_00]: series of coffee shops in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I went to them a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, basically at that point in
Neville's career, he wasn't as interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in breeding with a bunch of Afghans and
stuff anymore, but he was really
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in his continuing his Hayes
work because that's, that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: interested him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said earlier about the Jack
Herrera, um, Neville didn't consider that
[SPEAKER_00]: line finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just released it under pressure from
Ben and Alan drunkers to coincide with
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, with the, uh, the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after he left sensei, him and Shanti
partnered together and they started
[SPEAKER_00]: taking, they already knew what strains
they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had two and L five hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them we call C five, uh,
which has been spreading around a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit in America now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some people that are selling
seed hybrids of it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's finally popped out on our side of
the, of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another one was called the one 22 or
the mango, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were trying to work out a poly
hybrid using skunk haze that would reflect
[SPEAKER_00]: the qualities of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were parallel breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what they were doing is old
school breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge pain in the ass in which
they were taking different scum cases and
[SPEAKER_00]: they were crossing it to these things and
they were growing out the kids and seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: if the dad threw the traits they wanted.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, most people don't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, as Matt can attest, that's a super
time consuming pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: The market doesn't let you have a strain
in six years later, release it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it doesn't, it doesn't work in
today's world, but they, he had been
[SPEAKER_00]: working on that for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kept working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually they found a skunk haze dad
that meet their criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville preferred the wine that you see
five is the mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that wine became known as super silver
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one three cups in the late nineties,
probably everybody knows about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very famous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dante preferred the skunk haze dad crossed
to the one 22 or the mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: My preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one got named the mango haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also my preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would actually, the, the one 22 is sadly
not in America yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the nicest and L five haze I've
smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of the eight fives, the C fives,
whatever, not that I'm an expert on all of
[SPEAKER_00]: them or anything, but I have in coffee
shops and getting to know people over
[SPEAKER_00]: there, smoked most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish I had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mango haze is dang, but it lives and you
can buy it from Shanti still, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: as the one 22 he it's, it's one 22 by
skunk haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called mango haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he also released something that
was the start of his Holy grail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: His Holy grail project was trying to
recapture the magic of haze and an actual
[SPEAKER_00]: wine and not F one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Neville talked extensively about how
he didn't like most of the poly hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: hazes nearly as much as the F ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was trying to figure out a way to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what he did is he took a five,
a five two, which is on the cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if Matt wants to show it,
but the a five two is on the cover of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: 89 and 90 catalog both.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took the a five to this ugly beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took the a five to that one and he
crossed it to haze seat and which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: famous dad that was used in almost all the
haze releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that was the first time that the a
dad and the C dad was crossed in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was 75% haze and 25% Northern
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they initially crossed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to be a personal breeding project as
their haze grail, but they found so much
[SPEAKER_00]: killer stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decided to release it and Neville's
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is still a cut of that first find in
Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the strongest sativa I know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a, uh, maybe the best way
to put it is all those old school stories
[SPEAKER_00]: of psychedelic trippy, hold onto your seat
sativas that make you see tracers in the
[SPEAKER_00]: corner of your vision and make you like
something's talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I kind of believe that was bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I smoked Neville's haze,
uh, that, you know, that they found that
[SPEAKER_00]: became famous and it literally felt like
the top of my head blew off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dead serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shared a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, at that point I had, I had the chem 91,
I had super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty potent, nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like the stuff we had in America
was mostly superior to what Europe had to
[SPEAKER_00]: offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met a gentleman who used to work with
Neville became friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked a small joint with two friends of
the Neville's haze and it blew my head
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it literally felt like,
like air was rushing over the top of my
[SPEAKER_00]: skull.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember holding onto the railing as I
walked down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The steps of the dude's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember feeling anxious, stoned tracers
rushing, uh, definitely feelings that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not used to in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at that point I realized that some
of those old sativa stories had the,
[SPEAKER_00]: that were true, that some people did get a
psychedelic, energetic, almost
[SPEAKER_00]: disassociative type of potent feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care how used you are to smoking,
whatever Afghans you're used to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance to Neville's haze and you smoke
some, you'll probably get knocked off your
[SPEAKER_00]: feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there was a person in the U S
and, and me and this guy don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: get along the best now, but, um,
but in, in all reality, the best Neville's
[SPEAKER_01]: haze I've ever smoked has come from snow
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a amazing selection of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think he used it in some breeding
work, but it was, uh, every spice you
[SPEAKER_01]: could imagine in a kitchen cabinet all in
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just, it was just so speedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really good though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend this, but if you smoke
too much Neville's haze, it feels kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like psychedelic cocaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, just go do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels, I mean, but some people,
some people feel like uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I get that from Afghanis,
which is really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it really, it really, uh, really has a
strange feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I looked for that Fino and Neville's
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought quite a bit of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, luckily that Fino still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still sold in coffee shops over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still people that hold it on that
side of the pond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Panic attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it, it, it was, uh, certain people
don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking hate roller coaster weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, but it is, it's, it's very tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hits you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extremely differently than most things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it certainly was factual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, okay, some of these people
that are making these stories about ties
[SPEAKER_00]: and Colombians and how it made them feel a
long time ago, um, are true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that, that, that cut has it in
spades.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's 75% haze, 25% Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first thing that crosses both
haze dads, A and C in the same line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've been, it's one of my white
rabbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've been searching for it since the
late nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where it exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't gotten it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully after this we'll have,
I don't know, nine or 10 companies making
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses with it from the U S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, now that we've mentioned it,
everybody's going to have it all of a
sudden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that thing takes like 16 weeks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a super long runner, but it
literally yields like three and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if, even if you, even if you were
to take that 16 weeks and turn it into
[SPEAKER_00]: eight weeks, basically like growing an
eight week pounds and a half a light
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it takes twice as long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I, I saw, I saw a room in
Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'll tell this story, uh, before it
gets too late, but I walked into a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a room in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was all, uh, NL five haze and
Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one of the craziest things I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were growing on a slanted floor with
drains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were growing in Rockwell croutons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwell is very popular in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they were growing in one gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was thick, thick stems growing out
of these one gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were on, they were on constant drip,
slow drip, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Draining out onto the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these stems went trimmed up about six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six foot three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they went up over my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: The netting was about six and a half feet
tall, three feet from about six and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: feet to about nine or 10 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a mass jungle of buds
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then six hundreds all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the more unusual grow rooms
I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it all like vertical bulbs hanging in
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they were just way up high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, so you look at the ground
and there's these tiny little one gallons
[SPEAKER_00]: of Rockwell croutons with these big fixed
stems coming out of the base that went up
[SPEAKER_00]: within me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right above my head, it just
branched into crazy Sativa arms
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that threw it for the coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that these last two episodes,
we basically sort of walked you through
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's main breeding era, which was 85
to 97, 98 that silver, super silver Hayes
[SPEAKER_00]: won three cannabis cups in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, 97, 98, 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people have heard of Neville's Hayes,
super silver Hayes, mango Hayes,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of the last major breeding that
Neville, not that Neville stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, but he did some much smaller
projects and collabs more with other
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was a bit more about that than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, you know, Neville probably had a
17 year run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a good run in this industry of,
of really great cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went through Steve bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went through Sensi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went through the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, he sold a bunch of,
we were not going to talk about that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, this episode, but he sold a bunch of
his stuff and gave a bunch of his cuts to
[SPEAKER_00]: Shanti.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it continued at Mr. Nice seeds in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so that's kind of Neville's,
as far as his breeding work, that's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of his arc for lack of a better way to put
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, you know, I don't know,
that's probably close to a good stopping
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so everyone, if you, if you want to
get involved in these conversations,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there might be people in the chat
room right now that are actually a part of
[SPEAKER_01]: our Patreon, they go into the discord and
we discuss all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these episodes that we are
recording, we do a lot of those
[SPEAKER_01]: discussions publicly with, uh,
with each other, um, and in that chat
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you, if you're a straight up
straight nerd, come join our Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a lot of those other guys can testify
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we also are going to start working on
doing some old cannabis publications,
[SPEAKER_01]: making those accessible for people,
not like high time shit, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that's off the radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that has a lot of old strain info,
a lot of old pictures, a lot of old
[SPEAKER_01]: growing info and, uh, all that's available
through our breeder syndicate Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So join up, be sure to, uh, do that,
make sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, we put up the crowd cast
links in the bio on breeder syndicate for
[SPEAKER_01]: each new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be sure to sign up for each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't send notifications every time
unless you sign up for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, uh, that's the housekeeping
details, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, the other thing we could say
is we say this every time we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: discord server, that's breeder syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can ask Matt and I questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pretty responsive on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, we pop in fairly often.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to also be doing some shorts
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not every subject requires an hour and a
half or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be doing a series of shorts
coming up five, 10, 15 minutes about
[SPEAKER_00]: various topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so sometimes your question might not
get talked about, but it might lead to a
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 or 15 minute short where we talk about
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we hopefully have some pretty cool old
school breeders that we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing on, uh, in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be doing this on a regular
basis, both the shorts and the long and
[SPEAKER_00]: the long factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't just be me and Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some breeders are shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're going to do our best to add in
some extra people and get, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty historical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for all that, you can reach us on a
Patron.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reach us on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The breeder syndrome is a damn tequila.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, all that, there's various ways you
can get ahold of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep this kind of thing
rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it was interesting to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise in the future, Matt'll talk
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but you know, I thank everybody
for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you thought it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you learned some things and,
uh, everybody thank you very much for
[SPEAKER_00]: signing up and listening for everybody
that stuck with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
