[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_02]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_02]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_02]: seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_02]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The syndicate is a collection of seed
makers that want to push back against all
[SPEAKER_02]: of the smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_02]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew with my co-host, Thousandfold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today we are honored to welcome not
just my friend Kush the Giants from the
[SPEAKER_02]: Canna Luminati, but the Don of the Canna
Luminati, Mr. Denali.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's probably one of our most
requested ever episodes, believe it or
[SPEAKER_02]: not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really stoked to get into this with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without further ado, Thousand,
you want to take it away?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we get, we even get Denali on the
camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Y'all have no idea how lucky you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as Matt mentioned, you know,
today we have a little round table on
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoor growing and we met and also I
think typically have not covered growing
[SPEAKER_04]: that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we thought we would ease our way
there talking to our good friends Denali
[SPEAKER_04]: and Kush of the Giants.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mazzolla.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ease it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Denali's Joke.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I guess we started at the start,
a little bit of an introduction from both
[SPEAKER_04]: of you perhaps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where, you know, where have you been
growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can disclose that or in as much
detail as you'd like to disclose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how long have you been growing
outdoors for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, Dee, let you take the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured you might.
[SPEAKER_00]: First outdoor grow was 1980 in a creek
bed, in a little creek bed that I just dug
[SPEAKER_00]: up the soil and removed some big rocks out
of the hole and planted a few seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: one came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I used Miracle Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used it back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, not a lot of options, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, not a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like 1985 or something
somewhere right about there that we
[SPEAKER_00]: started adding amendments and things like
that to a blood meal, bone meal and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still never got into what they do
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't close to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of skipped over something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your first indoor grows or outdoor
grows you saw for what year?
[SPEAKER_00]: 1980.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that I saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't move up till, up here till 79.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did put a couple of seeds,
just like a half an inch in the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: super hard soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time I wasn't connected with
anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was very low key.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be hard to connect, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: In that era?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hard to get weed when I first got
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause people just don't trust you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a bad scene back there getting
caught.
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you get into smoking during your
era?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're probably, I would say two
generations of growers away from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was back in 1975.
[SPEAKER_00]: My girlfriend broke up with me and I was
bummed and a couple of buddies came by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember Mikey had a 1969 Camaro
when we were going to cruise and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting in the back seat and Pat,
he said, Hey, we're going to fire up a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I never smoked it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, well, you're going to take a
hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, well, just go ahead and sell
it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sat back there and I smoked half that
joint and I never got high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was the very first time I smoked
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third time I smoked weed that I
did get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I was, I lived sheltered life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my dad, he wrote his Congressman
about Playboy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were totally against drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mom got upset when I named my little
hamster Hoshimoto.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's how I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like the third time I got stoned,
man, I could talk to the girls and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I started smoking all the time
or eggs early after that parties,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never dated in high school, anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Knowing you, it's funny because I can
probably count the number of times I've
[SPEAKER_02]: been like, hey, Denali, you want to try
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're always the first one that's down to
just try whatever and love it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the fact that you ever had a time
period where you hadn't smoked weed and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're just like, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 19.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never in high school.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a couple of sub questions here for
Denali.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you started growing in 1980.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you taken in many breaks between then
and now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get transferred with the company I
was working with and I wouldn't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we moved to an association,
HOA, and you couldn't put up fences and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was years I didn't grow,
you know, but I knew people that weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't hard getting weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always kind of stayed in the scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that first time getting high,
it's been forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why he's the Don right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of when you were first starting
growing, what kind of information did you
[SPEAKER_04]: have access to about the plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hadn't read any books or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't talk to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did what I thought.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you just figured it out as you went
on, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've learned so much more since being
in this group than I have in all those
[SPEAKER_00]: years prior.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you felt your way through it like
making love to a man like your first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just kind of feel your way through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that Manzola is for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I miss this, Denali?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you tell us, you know, roughly where
you were based?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you don't have to, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of my ID pictures show where
I'm at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Lake County in North California.
[SPEAKER_03]: North Cal, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 1979.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you, Kushith the Giants?
[SPEAKER_04]: When did you start and where are you
growing at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started in 2008 when I turned 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since I was about 14 or 15,
I was always in my brother's garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the one who introduced me to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he was watering or taking care of
his stuff, I was always out there helping
[SPEAKER_01]: him and bullshitting with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm about 180 miles north of Denali in
between Shasta and Lassen County in the
[SPEAKER_01]: foothills of Lassen.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of us who are like not super
familiar with the geography there,
[SPEAKER_04]: how similar would you say the conditions
are between where you two are growing,
[SPEAKER_04]: living?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in the valley and he gets a higher
heat index than I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I live on the side of a mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we share a lot of the same similarities
in our heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to like things dealing
with like the cooling off at night,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my temperatures drop off a lot
more than people do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Down in the valley at sea level,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you good?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at thirty four hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm like 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Lake County also has an interesting
like aspect to it with the like living
[SPEAKER_01]: next to the water like that kind of my
aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I have to do it every time someone
says.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I was wondering where that came
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caught me off guard for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, wait, it's not so listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's under Matt's table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think living right on the lake
edge and growing right on in that area has
[SPEAKER_01]: a huge effect on your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think it's a totally different
environment than what I'm dealing with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess we should say right off
the bat that one obviously one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: biggest differences between going outdoors
and indoors is that you are very much
[SPEAKER_04]: constrained by your immediate environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in some ways, that's going to be a
running theme through this talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, on that note, I did want to ask
you to as well as part of this intro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you two grown indoors much?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: First indoor grow I had was 1988.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was underneath the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Buddy had a couple clones that there's
a story about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew them one year and went to a
rehab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't grow any for another probably
two years after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I never really got into indoor grown
because the climate is so good up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that I can grow outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you want to personally did you want to
dip into that little story that you just
[SPEAKER_04]: mentioned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, some people say bullshit,
you know, but that's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1985, I met a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started fishing together and he had he
took me over to his house and walked me
[SPEAKER_00]: out to a barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And went in the barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's all these pot plants growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just little bitty tiny pot plants,
maybe a foot tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And had them under lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was using CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was taking his own clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the lights he was using,
metal halide and high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was advanced for that year,
like doing CO2, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: High pressure sodium lights were on a
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had this whole operation going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me the story of where he got
these two cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a friend of his was an electrician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked up in the northwest at a
university up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he came back, his buddy started
growing these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they those two were friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because their two ladies they were with
went to high school together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were best friends in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how Tom and I'll call him
Carlos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carlos met.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tom turned him on to these cuts that
he brought back from the northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one was green, one was a little bit
purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that that's where they came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1985 was the university up in the
northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was growing in vermiculite and
perilyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe it was about 70,
30, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In two gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would veg for 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would take them at eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like clockwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that shit was so stony.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green one would stick to the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the purple one wasn't as high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't get the same high out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was still primo weed at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I buddied up with him real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to this day, we're still friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1985 with the early Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an early time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that you mentioned they stick to
the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a common thing that I've heard
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: How people are so used to certain types of
bud that when they found something that
[SPEAKER_02]: was physically sticky, it would stick to
things that really, really freaked them
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anybody could tell me how he knew
the story about these two, one green,
[SPEAKER_00]: one purple, from a university up in the
northwest, how did he know that story in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1985?
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody can tell me that, then I won't
believe what he had was the UW.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: You've had time with the PNW hash plant
now, yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think comparatively?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pucky?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say more like it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not full of resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least not the way I grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not doing what he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always wanted to take both those cuts
and run them just like he did and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: they would do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like he was using an early form
of the hempy bucket system, which is just
[SPEAKER_02]: perlite and nutrients just constantly
feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when I first met him,
he was using violet food because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: variegated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Violet plant is variegated like a cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he switched over to Jax 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Jax, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jax 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was like 550, 18,
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Jax makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people used that too during that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I used it a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still works.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some great insight into the
possible UW origins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of the better ones that we've
seen where there's pictures and testimony
[SPEAKER_02]: about it that far back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what he told me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he couldn't have known that story
without it happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this dude's still around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the most arrogant piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get him on a show, but he would
just tell you how great he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sounds like he's pretty great,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he still swears he grows the
best weed in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does he?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that in 85 he is running lights
on rails and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so advanced.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so advanced.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would be taking it down to LA,
getting rid of it like 4,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just murdering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to butt in and say that
even though this is a bit of a tangent,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we want to get a few stories out
of Denali.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because obviously, he's witnessed a lot.
Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a fun ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fun ride.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Kush of the Giants, have you had
much experience growing indoors?
[SPEAKER_04]: And why I'm asking you both this is just
so we can later on kind of I want to get
[SPEAKER_04]: to teasing out some of the differences.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I play around a little bit indoors,
but it's usually after my outdoor season
[SPEAKER_01]: is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my section of the mountain,
pretty much for about four months out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the year, we have a foot of snow on the
ground or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when that happens and I'm done with
harvest and everything's taken care of,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when I swap into indoor mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my indoor stuff is always playing
around, trying new stuff, trying mediums,
[SPEAKER_01]: like trying pure cocoa or trying some DWC
buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always been just just something new
and fresh to just play around and give
[SPEAKER_01]: something new a try.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for you, your indoor is your kind of
like yearly focus.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, sorry, your outdoor is like your
main focus and your indoor is a bit of a
[SPEAKER_04]: like play around experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another reason why that is due to
power outages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in such a rural area that I'm used
to losing like 17, 18 days of power
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout my four month, five month
winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of my.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've had a lot of runs where it's
like, OK, well, today's day five without
[SPEAKER_01]: any lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this runs over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have like generator backups?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have generator backups and stuff,
but I've never like I said, the indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: grow is always like secondary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not my main focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've never had that specific breaker
panel set up on the automatic generator.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the garage, not on the main house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I get you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I plan on eventually upgrading to where
when we lose power, I can still have the
[SPEAKER_01]: tents running, but it's just not a main
major priority for me right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there would be a huge project in and
of itself, I imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I looked at getting the generator,
the generators installed for auto swap
[SPEAKER_01]: over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's it's a little expensive,
but but definitely worth it for for the
[SPEAKER_01]: projects that I plan on doing in the
future.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get you.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, yeah, well, thank you both for telling
us a bit about, you know, how long you've
[SPEAKER_04]: been growing for, you know, your relative
experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one important thing that I've
talked to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Kush and maybe Matt as well,
you know, in starting to approach growing
[SPEAKER_04]: information, I think we want to be quite
careful about how we frame this
[SPEAKER_04]: information, like we're definitely not
trying to tell people that like this is
[SPEAKER_04]: your, you know, quote unquote ultimate
guide, you know, insert YouTube clickbait
[SPEAKER_04]: title here to growing or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think for me, my idea is that we just
try to share and be explicit about the
[SPEAKER_04]: diversity of environments and conditions
that people, different people are growing
[SPEAKER_04]: in because different people have just very
different growing situations.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, well, we can actually get into a bit
more of the core growing issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first thing that stands out when
we talk about outdoor growing is obviously
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be climate, I think, for a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: You two did touch on climate a little bit,
but can you tell us again, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: how would you describe the climate in your
where you're growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it's arid, hot and arid for like
most of all of July, all of August,
[SPEAKER_01]: most of September.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then right around the end of September
and the start of October, we get some
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty heavy showers.
[SPEAKER_04]: How?
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, maybe Kush, you start.
[SPEAKER_04]: How how have you had to adapt to that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or like how do you see your grow kind of
being?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, having having evolved to deal with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my challenge is with the climate have
changed as my goals have changed with my
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, back when I was monocropping
a single strain and trying to get as much
[SPEAKER_01]: weight as possible, I worried quite a bit
about the climate and making sure that I
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest before heavy rain comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm more worried about PM and
and Bud Rot and these things because
[SPEAKER_01]: because weight is my main goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the last three or four years,
those goals have shifted because nobody's
[SPEAKER_01]: buying that weight anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now I don't worry about the climate
as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a plant is expressing some PM or
expressing some mold, I'm not going to cut
[SPEAKER_01]: it down right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to see what this plant is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natural resistances are like I'm going to
harvest enough out of it to where I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: worried about getting every ounce and
every gram off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get to see some more expressions
rather than worry about making sure I
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest every plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: At its maximum weight potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you, Denali?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember what the question was.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess it was, yeah, first,
a little bit about the climate that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: growing in and secondarily, how have you
like dealt with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've been trying to pick strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's picking up a lot of background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you tell her we love her right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love you, V.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show what I made tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she wanted to show me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show you what you made.
[SPEAKER_01]: She made replicated the jalapeno poppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look exactly the same, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, I ate so many of those and like,
you know, I was on my diet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't supposed to be eating that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are those are coming again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are absolutely being made again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's like cushiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dry and hotter than hell here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it rained earlier today here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was just a freak thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in September, it starts to cool down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a little more rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it gets bad enough, you got to
worry about the mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, where I live, it's like every year
I get a different kind of critter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it might be my one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be three to one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might be one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you have to deal with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any good stories about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: God, I remember plants just covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Semi bug resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just don't get on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know bad ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Russets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only had one time and I just any
plant that had them, I cut it down and put
[SPEAKER_00]: them in my green barrel and got rid of
them and just didn't have that much that
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's damn near the perfect
environment here for cannabis for certain
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's those 19 weekers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chamba.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chamba.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chamba.
[SPEAKER_00]: January.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, on that topic of pestinale,
is there anything you do to try to
[SPEAKER_04]: mitigate against this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that three in one stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't want to try anything in
flower, but three in one is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on the bug, there's white
fly stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use neem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like neem personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't stand the smell of it anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't stand the smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm traumatized by it either.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so ineffective other than as a leaf
shine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good for shining your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's about it, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot of them cabbage moss
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the caterpillar goes in and
caterpillar killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it's been a sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that bug is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you talking about spin a sad or B.T.?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, B.T.
[SPEAKER_02]: B.T.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you have to do with any like
mammals?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Gophers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess or yeah, whatever else
that's out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gophers are a big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you plant straight in the ground,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's a real issue.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I'm living, they brought this durian
and packed it in and made canals in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't seen a gopher here in 40
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been dealing with them all like the
last two years at this place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime we plant something in the ground,
whether it's a fig tree, cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: anything, it's just rabid.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're savaged instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raccoons mess with plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terrors.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're evil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys have raccoons in New Zealand?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we have like what's the closest thing
that we've got to that?
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got kind of like stoat or weasel
type things.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, raccoons are their nightmare trash
pandas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the worst.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like they're mean, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're vicious little shits.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a herd of them around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, we don't have any gophers or molds
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know guys in the valley where they have
garden and right in the soil, they have
[SPEAKER_00]: just hundreds of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush might have ground squirrels up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've only had it happen once out of all
the cultivars that I've grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a train wreck across to a Salmon
Creek big bug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some reason, the gray squirrels
literally ate the nugs off of the plant at
[SPEAKER_01]: about week four or five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the only plant they touched.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was something about the dirt profile
or that specific plant that they liked
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to just literally gnaw on the tops
of the plants like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about pests in general for you,
Kush?
[SPEAKER_04]: What other things have you encountered?
[SPEAKER_04]: Bugs, other mammals?
[SPEAKER_04]: Rodents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my area, there's tons and tons of
mule deer and black tails.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on my IG, on my photos, every plant
you'll see will have an internal cage with
[SPEAKER_01]: about a three foot diameter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that cage not only provides structure
for the plant, but it protects from deer
[SPEAKER_01]: that want to come and chomp the plant down
to the stalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I didn't have those internal cages
protecting them, then all of those plants
[SPEAKER_01]: would get chomped down by deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as mammal goes, that's the most
mammals that I have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then pests, actual bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thankfully, I've never had to deal with
mites and I've never had to deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do have to deal with aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my first year dealing with aphids was
2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I attacked the aphids instead of
attacking the ants, which the ants are
[SPEAKER_01]: symbiotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They carry the aphids onto the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aphids suck the life out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They poop out this honeydew, the ants
harvest the honeydew.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole symbiotic relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second I started attacking the
ants, the aphids no longer became a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best thing that I've found is food
grade diatomaceous earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sprinkle it in a heavy ring around the
base of my pot and it acts as a barrier
[SPEAKER_01]: that they will not cross through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate that when they girdle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just put out bowls of water for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they do with the water?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they're, yeah, that's why
they're plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always wondered, like, because I've had
rats, like paratroop and indoor grows in
[SPEAKER_02]: my garages, like, you know, 14 feet up and
there's no way for them to get in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got chicken wire everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think and they would come in through the
tops every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: All they would do is like girdle,
like at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: The base of the plant and nothing else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it would be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: One bite on that fucker and be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so painful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put them out some water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no clue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like tripping on my own glue traps
and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to be kind to your guests.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you got to give them provisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck with your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like the Santa Claus harmony.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other thing I'd like to add with pests
is there's a really cool insect called a
[SPEAKER_01]: green lacewing and introducing those to my
garden has been one of the coolest
[SPEAKER_01]: symbiotic like things I've ever seen in my
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their their life cycle is to literally
kill aphids and reproduce into these
[SPEAKER_01]: really cool flying insects that are that
are really quite beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for people who don't have ants but
have aphids, they usually resort to
[SPEAKER_01]: ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're buying ladybugs to protect
your plants, I highly suggest buying green
[SPEAKER_01]: lace wings as well, either in their larva
form or in the egg form and then getting
[SPEAKER_01]: them on your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's it's really cool to study the
life cycle and understand how they work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really one of the most brutal
like aspects of nature I've ever seen
[SPEAKER_01]: because the the larva form of this insect,
it's literally a miniature grub with a
[SPEAKER_01]: giant spike on its head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it rams the aphid, holds it above its
head and it drinks the fluid as it's
[SPEAKER_01]: draining the blood out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, with from a spike on its head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it throws the corpse on its back
and uses it as a disguise so that other
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids don't know that it's a predator.
[SPEAKER_01]: It literally disguises itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're called aphid lions when they're in
that stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look up some YouTube videos on
them, it's it's one of the coolest things
[SPEAKER_01]: in nature, one of the most brutal things
in nature I've ever seen.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nature is metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually going and buying these right
now because, you know, I've had problems
[SPEAKER_02]: also because I don't do a lot of outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't done like even when I was doing
outdoor, like it was usually greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was like because something
messed up with the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: we ended up on the back of the hillside,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trying to do outdoor has been really,
really like butting my head against a wall
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes to pests via thrips or
aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have any tips for thrips?
[SPEAKER_01]: So ever since I've been in the same valley
within the same like three, four hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: yards in this little valley growing for
the past since 2008 and every year on like
[SPEAKER_01]: one percent of my fan leafs, I see thrift
damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's it's so minuscule that I've never
seen it as an issue where I have to tackle
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had such a thrift infestation
that it becomes a huge problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when I'm looking at a very
small amount of fan leafs that have a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not as big of a deal at that
point.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had thrips one year and in flower,
late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do a shit and think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't going to spray my buds or
anything.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they've been brutal here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one thing with outdoor
growing is you're never going to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that's like, at least in my
subjective experience, I've never had a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that's like not what's what I'm
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Impervious to to pests when you're growing
outdoor in that environment, your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to have something on them at
some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's been it's been hard trying to
explain this to my chick because she's
[SPEAKER_02]: seen my indoor grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's used to seeing like no pests and
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, what is going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why can't it look like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why isn't it it's it's try to explain like
how much you have to stay on top of
[SPEAKER_02]: spring, how much you have to stay on top
of all this just to have those kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: perfect leaves and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it's hard to stay on top of.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's funny is way back in the 80s,
I don't remember bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not remember having bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they they introduce a lot of
bugs in the states, like I know here they
[SPEAKER_02]: put spider mites on the edges of freeways,
like in the in the garden area there to
[SPEAKER_02]: take care of whatever bugs they have
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, these all end up in in your
grows here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it's really hard everywhere,
depending on what your city uses for its
[SPEAKER_02]: own pest management.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if like you're in an agricultural
valley like us, where you have all these
[SPEAKER_02]: big crops of grapes, almonds, all this
other stuff around, bringing in all these
[SPEAKER_02]: other types of bugs, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wild to try to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have wineries here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bring in all kinds of crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one other thing that I'd like to talk
about is with pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed that some cultivars have a
natural pest resistance, not a complete
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance, but where I've had plants side
by side where one was covered in aphids
[SPEAKER_01]: and one wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're literally three feet away from
each other where they should have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a collective like a collective
comparison that I've noticed between them
[SPEAKER_01]: is a lot of them have peppery,
cushy like carfenolene.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have that that potent pepper kind of
smell to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that those plants like the living dead
girl that has the PCK in it, it was very
[SPEAKER_01]: peppery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those plants had little to no pest
intrusion on them whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that you can only know which
plants will do well by actually trying
[SPEAKER_04]: them out?
[SPEAKER_04]: In your in your particular environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you can get a good baseline from
seeing other people's outdoor grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the expressions will be the
expressions will vary depending on your
[SPEAKER_01]: specific environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is I put up a picture of the green
lacewing just so people can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a larval form.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's on rice hulls or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What great color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just randomly, because, Matt, you asked me
about land mammals in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just a bit of trivia.
[SPEAKER_04]: New Zealand historically actually has no
native land mammals.
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: Apart from bats.
[SPEAKER_04]: So humans introduced the first land
mammals to the country, I think maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: seven, eight hundred years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those were rats.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then later on we got possums,
weasels, stoats.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe you guys got access to some sort
of goat as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we've got goat and deer now as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So but before before humans, there were
only nice birds and bats.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it makes sense that rats would
have been one of the first because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: ships and the cargo ships and different
pests and mammals that got aboard that
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, unfortunately, I cannot
speak to growing outdoors here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe in the future someone could.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not me for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we could basically ask an
Australian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same shit, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, their creatures are different.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a different vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need to get you're telling you're
an Aussie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know it's easy, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to get booze on.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to get booze on at some point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything else that you all wanted
to say about pests?
[SPEAKER_04]: In your outdoor gross?
[SPEAKER_01]: What I will say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, not so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's not much more that I mean,
most of the pests that we encounter
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors, we kind of went over.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got a question in this in this room
real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could pick maybe two things from
your toolbox that you think that are just
[SPEAKER_02]: essential for outdoor growing for pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: For IPM, what are the two things that you
would advise people to at least take a
[SPEAKER_02]: look at?
[SPEAKER_02]: To cushion the giants first.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two things that I mentioned,
the diatomaceous earth, the food grade
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not causing any issues with your
plant consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one is using natural
methods, ladybugs, green lace wings,
[SPEAKER_01]: using nematodes, using natural predators,
because they're essentially going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: more work than you can with your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just take your hands and they're better
at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_00]: D to do things I'm not without is having
forbidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't forget you go to wake you up,
say D D D D three and one and the
[SPEAKER_00]: caterpillar yen that handles most of my
problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, leaving you pissed, rôle of water.
[SPEAKER_04]: so they comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bowls of water, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bowls of water for the wood rats.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, those cabbage loopers too out
here are just nightmarish.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no time I can get away with the
grow without seeing those.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always the first thing to attack
my plants, cabbage loopers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it gets hot down by you.
[SPEAKER_02]: 111 something today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, jeez.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I wanted to move on to, I don't
know, just for fun, a bit of drama.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about human piss?
[SPEAKER_04]: Tweakers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Denali, have you had to deal with many
human piss?
[SPEAKER_04]: Tweakers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tweakers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any good stories?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one for Denali that you can
mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a tweaker that got him to take
care of his veg garden for a while,
[SPEAKER_02]: but never mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: He overwatered.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I was ripped off my first year I
grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I went maybe 38, 39 years and
never got ripped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody came in and ripped my one
plant off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: P91.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was coming down that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe that was my neighbor across
the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because normally he'd get something from
me at Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that Christmas, he didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you bastard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I truly believe it was his kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he went for the P91, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God, it was so good that year,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very proud of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you look him in the eye after that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I had no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but he he got a little fidgety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they probably moved three months
later.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nobody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll get to him later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don does not allow this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bad thing is, is the house straight
across street two story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a rental as far as weekends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're like everybody knew all the
time coming in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nobody that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you I mean, despite not having too many
experiences in that context, do you take
[SPEAKER_04]: any precautions around those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend bungee sticks and claymores.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Claymore lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like those things where you you
know, you dig a hole in the ground,
[SPEAKER_02]: you put spikes in and then cover it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A pitfall trap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are really, really, really
effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smear poop on the spikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch Home Alone for more inspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking more yellow jackets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those little girls got wild with the
spikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let them grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they start in a plant, I'll let them
make their little hive in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember not just stick my hand in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that picture yesterday of the yellow
jackets up in there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Denali is talking about literal yellow
jackets.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt's talking about a TV show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I saw that picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that picture yesterday of wasps in
his garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Touched them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not sure if they're yellow jackets
or hornets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I got hit eight times on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember Indra.
[SPEAKER_00]: He told me I need to hang fish hooks right
at eye level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indra's brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God, it would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Indra.
[SPEAKER_02]: We miss him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely miss him.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you, Kush?
[SPEAKER_04]: Human tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the spot that I'm at, it's pretty
rural.
[SPEAKER_01]: The little valley that it's in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a person is trespassing,
they know they're on private property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thankfully, I haven't had any issues
with people, you know, randos showing up,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking through the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I still take precautions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have trail cameras set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I check the dirt to and from the grow
every day for footprints.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also checking for game sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're always taking precautions to
make sure you're the only one in and out
[SPEAKER_01]: of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other than that, really, the only
people that we're worried about up here is
[SPEAKER_01]: helicopters looking for your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something on the mountain that we've kind
of noticed is they'll check out
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's grow from the helicopter,
but they only bust people who have like
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 plants or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you have the type of property that
looks like they can make some money from
[SPEAKER_01]: the civil forfeiture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen the helicopters fly through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next day, the bus go off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's generally only the people who
have like 300, 400, 500 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's weird with our county,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They flip flop voting every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: One year, it's legal to grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: One year, it's not legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody on the mountain who's doing,
like me, 10, 12 plants, we just grow it
[SPEAKER_01]: anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And expect the worst or best to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use baby monitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody who's used trellis knows how
bad that is if you get it in your feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll put a bunch of that out on my
back deck with some Coke cans tied to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you can't walk through that
trellis and not get your foot hung in that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be having no damn
flashlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's little things you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing I know, since we're all in
California, none of us would ever own a
[SPEAKER_02]: weapon to protect ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a weapon?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard of one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought a paintball gun would be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I bet it would.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we would never even own one because it
looks too close to a real one.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about a super soaker?
[SPEAKER_02]: Too close to a real one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably get us killed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just one of those things in
California where or actually the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States where they make it kind of extra
charges if you get caught with any kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: weapon, despite the fact that they know
that indoor growers are targets for being
[SPEAKER_02]: raw.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably needing outdoor, indoor doesn't
really matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they need to be able to protect
themselves probably more than most other
[SPEAKER_02]: home businesses being with their
businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they actually make it illegal for you
to do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least in California, you have to sign
papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: People work saying that you do not grow
when purchasing a firearm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you all are happy to move on from
this topic, I thought another one that's
[SPEAKER_04]: like really fundamental, probably you two
take it for granted more or less by now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do want to ask about like your
vegging window, your flowering window,
[SPEAKER_04]: how you strategize around that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Denali, do you want to start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I pretty much let the sun do all the
work, you know, and then plants are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to flower when they want to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just run them out till they start.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally that's in August.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you might get a few early
flowers in July, but then it depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some you take that 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get that window of opportunity
with the weather, some of them that are
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter, they get taken in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say the majority in October.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, kind of a general rule of thumb that
my brother taught me and pretty much what
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed a lot of the growers go by is
outdoors by Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your plants outdoors by Mother's Day
if you want to get like a six or an eight
[SPEAKER_01]: foot tall plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally August 1st is when we would
expect stretch and the initial signs of
[SPEAKER_01]: flower to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of for pretty much
everybody that I talked to in Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty baseline statement that I
hear from most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally don't do Mother's Day
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do June 1st because I've had days before
where snow dropped and I had plants
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors and I was like, well,
shit, you know, I got little seedlings
[SPEAKER_01]: getting drowned out by snow and late
spring snowstorms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That hit randomly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I wait a little bit later and I go
outdoors on June 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I usually put 12 to 14 inch tall
seedlings out expecting something between
[SPEAKER_01]: the six and the eight or nine foot range,
which is about the size of plant that I
[SPEAKER_01]: prefer working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like when they get much bigger
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go in much later than you with tweakers
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't grow an eight foot and nine foot
plant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have it below the fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've tied them down and kept them
below the fence, but I generally don't go
[SPEAKER_00]: in until July just so they don't get so
big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I personally think a smaller plant
might be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to say that, but I do than them
giant plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my dwarf plants, some years where
I grow and a plant will dwarf out and it
[SPEAKER_01]: will only go for like the Snow S1 from
last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my smallest plants, one of the most
potent, hardest hitting, longest lasting
[SPEAKER_01]: smokes out of the 13 cultivars that I
grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a little dwarf thing that was
no different than the other plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: were all 12 to 14 inches when they went
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know there's talk about how
smaller plants will produce more resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: The energy is all focused on a much
smaller structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gives it more benefits, but I've
never done the test personally myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to take a cutting of the same
plant and grow a big one and a small one
[SPEAKER_01]: and side by side and test them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be a really fun project.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, anything else?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on like plant size that you guys
wanted to throw in there since that's like
[SPEAKER_04]: an interesting little topic?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, plant size is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes like some plants that I think
will not have a long stretch phase end up
[SPEAKER_01]: stretching like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never really know with some of these
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something else that I think we kind of
touched on earlier is like selecting the
[SPEAKER_01]: specific cultivars for your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the years, I've unconsciously leaned
towards Afghani genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized that where I'm growing is
very similar to high altitude Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at photos and videos,
it's high desert pine with red clay soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly where I live.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed a relationship between the
Afghani cultivars that just basically grew
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves in my environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kept leaning towards them naturally
because they performed the best in my
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So often, you know, it's about finding
good fit, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like a general principle,
I imagine, of growing outdoors,
[SPEAKER_04]: finding the right plants to fit your
environment as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think two of the better plants ever grew
was in 82.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was living in a fifth wheel in a
trailer park.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put up a eight by 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little, you know, those sear storage
sheds, you know, with the metal doors and
[SPEAKER_00]: put up the fiberglass roofing on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Buddy and I started these nine plants
in there and they grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one that just stayed super
short.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't probably get three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these other ones, you know,
hell, they're up against the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can perfectly see a cannabis leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that wasn't going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to the boarding goods store and
bought all these, you know, one,
[SPEAKER_00]: two ounce lead sinkers and fish hooks,
snail fish hooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put these weights on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I kept all these plants in
that eight by 10 storage shed bent over
[SPEAKER_00]: and not touching the top with weights and
sinkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after they butted in that,
God, what a mess it was with all that
[SPEAKER_00]: weights and sinkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Banging into your hook and stuff like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two plants that came out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is super short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't grow very big, bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it smelled just like 7up and it tasted
just like 7up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was this one that grew and
it grew really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grew like a rose, you know,
with the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't a lot of hairs on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember what it was?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, these were all seeds that would
just get out of bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, but I've seen it
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that rose petal like what I call
it one time in Spring Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was probably five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't see it till it was damn near
ready to cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I probably should have took it cutting
and just, you know, try to get it to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say rose, are you talking about
bud formation or leaf formation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually the leaf formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, the leaf comes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way it cuts it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Urkel can do that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Poodle nuts has some look like that,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it can rose top or flower top
almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was strong and it was super
crystalline and sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is actually touching on the
question I wanted to get to anyway,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is about what have some of your
favorite plants been to grow outdoors?
[SPEAKER_04]: Denali, you can you can keep going if you
want.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go with orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about it?
[SPEAKER_04]: What about it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you like growing outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a crazy different smell,
at least the one I have got a crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: different smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a great high as far as for me,
you know, and we said, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: subjectable, I guess it would be,
you know, might not get you as high as it
[SPEAKER_00]: does me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one that like I think everybody
like pretty much agrees that it's as
[SPEAKER_02]: strong as Kim D or close to it,
like no ceiling type high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have to say I like not so D,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So both of those plants do well outdoors
for you, Denali.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything about them you think
that lends them to that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the structure?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it, you know, what is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I might give more love and I might tell
them a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's because you like them more that
like you pamper them more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always some in the garden that are
that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I got to say I thank not so very
much for sharing that with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For slipping you the D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're what?
[SPEAKER_02]: One of two people in our group he's ever
passed something to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the Don Don.
[SPEAKER_00]: DAWN.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, over the years, it's definitely
a personal taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's from like a nostalgic
purpose, too, because the first weed that
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked that got me really, really,
really high was my brother's Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from then on out, it just set kind of
like a precedent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed in my outdoor gardens
continually the first bag to go or the
[SPEAKER_01]: first jar to go is something that leans O
.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I would grow a plethora of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the years, just the White Fire O
.G., Fire O.G., Tahoe, Skywalker,
[SPEAKER_01]: Candy Kush, Larry O.G., the Orange Kush,
the Obama Kush, the Dosey Doe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all of this stuff for me personally
just hits my favorite stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a big part of that is just just nice
pain relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's something in the O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: that has great inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps with inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it has a great amount of
anti-inflammatory to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just it helps me with everything when I
smoke an O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing with O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've noticed, like looking at test
results and it has the same effect for me,
[SPEAKER_02]: too, even with anti-anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't normally get anxiety with O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: despite the high potency is that they're
both super high in mercy, like really
[SPEAKER_02]: high, even though it's totally different
smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know there's more components,
obviously, in O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: than just mercy, but they both like
blueberry and mercy or blueberry and O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: test super high for mercy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always thought that was interesting for
the pain relief and positive aspect.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say like the pain
relief is probably one of my main goals
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm looking for in some of the
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a lot of outdoor activities and I'm a
bit overweight, so it doesn't wear and
[SPEAKER_01]: tear on my body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the day, I'm looking to
smoke something that takes away all the
[SPEAKER_01]: pain that I accumulated throughout the day
doing shit I probably shouldn't have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another plant I've grown was resins cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I really like growing that one,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that does really well outdoor with
you, like the turps, everything is just
[SPEAKER_02]: loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the first and only plant I reversed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow!
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, with your spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reversed it, got balls and then they were
getting real close and I cut the branches
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you were just test reversing it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to see if I could do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You definitely can.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to ask, Kush, so you
mentioned that you like those plants for
[SPEAKER_04]: various reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pain Relief, one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any features of those plants you
think that lend themselves to growing
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoors well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, stocky structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hold up their own weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to tie up many branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have a structure where I'm
worried about their weight causing issues
[SPEAKER_01]: with them, which is a lot of the issues in
late season with my setup and how big my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are is how I'm going to support
weak armed or weak branched plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with those OGs and those hybrids,
they basically grow themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to do a whole lot of external
work to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because my segue was actually going to be
into plant training and whether either of
[SPEAKER_04]: you have to do much training on your
outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very subjective between the
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some you have to tie up every branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some I don't have to tie up a branch at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants, like last year, I had the
Albert Walker to the bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was so heavily weighted down and had
such spindly branches that I did a
[SPEAKER_01]: secondary outer cage and tied them to that
cage as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without that support, every branch would
have literally just snapped at the first
[SPEAKER_01]: inch or two of snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very subjective between
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's some you don't need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some years I get really involved and I'll
pound stakes in and I'll run trellis two
[SPEAKER_00]: lengths, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two things to trellis through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trellis is such a pain in the ass when you
go to take it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing you didn't mention was using
trellis for caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh, the bird netting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk about that real quick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one year I happened to have put it
over my vegetable garden and I seen one of
[SPEAKER_00]: them cabbage moths bounce off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, shit, I get a pain in
the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll put that bird netting over my
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as you keep it where there are
no holes, you're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one gets in there, he can't get out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It bounces around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's flawless.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get through.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's such good tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caterpillars then you don't have to worry
about any spraying or anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was good then with that trellis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never seen that before, but that
really, really shocked me that the
[SPEAKER_02]: caterpillars actually or the moths bounce
off or whatever's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are the holes just too small for them to
enter in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're like five eights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're, yeah, they're pretty
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, with those wings out,
yeah, they're not big too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the biggest pieces I've found,
you know, locally was like 28 by 28.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd have to put a couple of them
together.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed to work well though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you said, it's a pain in the ass
to get the trellis out once you're
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting sometimes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything going through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You generally got a lollipop, everything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just tops coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to loop back for a sec onto,
back to your favorite plants for just for
[SPEAKER_04]: a moment, because I remembered one more
thing I want to ask, which is,
[SPEAKER_04]: have you two gotten the chance to try the
same, you know, clones, cultivars,
[SPEAKER_04]: both the indoor grown, versus outdoor
grown?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, that was a kind of garbled
question, but I think.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of the stuff that I've played
around with indoors, we ran outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a Cindy 99 cut that leaned pineapple
and it performed really great indoors and
[SPEAKER_01]: tasted really amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we grew it outdoors, she lost a
lot of her pineapple turps and she didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: hold up structure very well for a big
outdoor plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with the ATF, but the Alaskan
Thunderfuck performed better outdoors than
[SPEAKER_01]: it did indoors, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it did a lot better outdoors
than it did on the indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your, I always ask people this
and they mention Alaskan Thunderfuck or
[SPEAKER_02]: Matanuska Valley Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: In your experience, what did it taste and
smell like?
[SPEAKER_01]: A unique blend of anise, like this weird,
yeah, it's like anise is a part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other part of it is almost a
chemically, something that's hard to,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I don't have the palate or the exact
impact smell to describe it perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was- But sense memory doesn't exist
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say it's somewhere in between
like chemical and one of the volatiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a stringent acrid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, acrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Acrid's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say acrid, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's interesting because I really
even with old dudes from Alaska,
[SPEAKER_02]: rarely do I ever see two people describe
Alaskan Thunderfuck the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always ask when I hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just got it from a dispensary in
like 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no clue about the- I just remember
the brightest, orangest hairs I've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: seen on a green bud with like perfect
triangular buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you would trim them up,
you could just roll the bud in your hand
[SPEAKER_01]: and hold it and just cut with the scissors
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is- Oh, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect triangular bud formation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes it easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when it's uniform from the top
to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love those cush genetics where it's like
golf ball nugs from the top to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my favorite structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's one of the only things I
like about cookies is how easy it is to
[SPEAKER_02]: trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting here thinking about the question
of my favorite plants and I just start
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking of one after another,
after another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lay them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's hear them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little snapper and it would be
enough, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we may as well- you may as well
tell us about the Chamba since we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was- I got transferred and I happened
to be in Bakersfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a Bakersfield substation right
next to the old ice plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the ice house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the ice house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was 1980.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was this before Matt was born?
[SPEAKER_02]: What year was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: 1980.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I wouldn't have been born yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was 81.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the guy lived in the place where we
worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was being transferred from
different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a few guys that lived over
Santa Cruz area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he brought this stuff over before
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why he called it Chamba.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, it was just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But $55.08.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then it was like screaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, robbing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that like $150 today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that, an eight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God, for an eight?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you were getting?
[SPEAKER_02]: An eight for 55?
[SPEAKER_00]: An eight for 55 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be about, I think, 130,
155 today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would just kill our bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a triangular- it looked like
Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exactly what it looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about that green color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they weren't stiff and hard buds,
but they were just nice compact buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't remember anything about this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's so long to ask about smell or
any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of that stick?
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a sweet smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't, you know, a harsh smell at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, just take a small hit and it
would expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would blow your lungs up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My older brother, that was the last time
he ever smoked weed is when he smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: Chamba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The older brother got some?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went down for Christmas and smoked with
some friends and my brother happened to be
[SPEAKER_00]: there and he wasn't a big smoker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he got this super panic attack,
thought he was going to die and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he scared himself so bad he hadn't
smoked since.
[SPEAKER_02]: That happens a lot with people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one negative experience, if it's bad
enough, like a serious panic attack can
[SPEAKER_02]: really turn people off from weed for good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good weed can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But plants that I really liked that I grew
indoors and outdoors was- and they
[SPEAKER_00]: happened to both be matte.
[SPEAKER_00]: My clockwork orange, I found that on the
indoor run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And riotberry hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that on an indoor run.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one gave me a fucking panic attack
too and blueberry never does that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was riotberry bubba G13 hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the whole thing was.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: While I have you here, do you want to tell
the story or you want me to tell the story
[SPEAKER_02]: about how we met and you bought those
fucking clockwork seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be glad to tell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was at the Sonoma County Cannabis
Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew you were going to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had talked over the, you know,
cause you had started doing your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I knew you were going to be there
and I was really excited to meet you and I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to meet you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a bummer, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had seen you sitting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a big line waiting to see you in
that preview.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they were getting clones there
also.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I got in line and I came with a
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just call him the butcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was standing in line and I got this
great idea of what I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told my buddy what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be around if you're going
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I waited in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got up there and I, you know,
probably wrong, but I acted like a deaf
[SPEAKER_00]: mute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a pad of paper with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had it in my little pack.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a pad of paper out and damn it,
I didn't have a pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went and pretended like writing on
this, you know, and Maggie, the guy didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: hand me a pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wrote there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was interested in, what were they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe banana riot buried crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it would have been that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I, you know, wrote out,
you know, I was interested in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, you know, held it five
fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him a week.
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went full 50 and now 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, okay, 450.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gave him the 450.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me the chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stuck my hand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, please meet you, Mr. Ryan.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name and then he walked off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he walked off and just like,
I'm like this motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an amazing story.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last part was that he came up to me
and was like, okay, so the extra 50 bucks,
[SPEAKER_02]: you want me to put it in the fire fund or
do you want it in the fire?
[SPEAKER_02]: He was going to pay it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had an option to take it back or put it
in the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could never forget that dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was sold on it that he was this
deaf mute and I was like, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Denali.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about a first impression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, ended up best friends after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a beautiful story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And who'd have known that he was the one
that impregnated my mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so weird.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small company.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was indeed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, in thinking about these plants
that you grew both indoor and outdoor,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, what were some of the main differences
that you saw in the indoor expressions
[SPEAKER_04]: versus the outdoor ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, clockwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get as much, uh, uh, resident in
that as I did indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right there I lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, that's not around, but,
uh, both of them were, uh, they grew
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the ones that I had indoors,
I've grown one of the, one of the guys
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a two 36.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I grew, you know, put it outside
and when I sent him a picture,
[SPEAKER_00]: he said, what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, that's your two 36.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, you're kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look anything like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did it do outdoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you 36 fair outdoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was, I thought it was fruity
myself or tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it did not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that is a dense plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a, uh, a picture with, uh,
uh, two 36 and the D and, uh, beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: picture and both of them look great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, D you've done indoor and out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, you haven't done to your north.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I, uh, I, you know, since,
uh, our friend was around and has
[SPEAKER_00]: departed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been, uh, haven't really
flowered or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to do, uh, uh, I ever get some,
some local, uh, uh, some local would grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all her or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like apple fritter or something like that
apple shitter.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I did it in indoors in a tan and,
uh, air conditioning went out in the house
[SPEAKER_00]: and it just cooked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet it really cooked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That plant does not have a lot of
resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're learning a lot about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I haven't flowered anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, coming up, you're going to have to do
Chamba indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to bring Chamba indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably what I'm gonna have to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a long flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the one from pack?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a long flowering bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 19 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm going to try to reverse it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably will.
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably will reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, see if I just get some male pollen and
maybe hit it with something a little
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit, hit some of those Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Short squat.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, that's in the works, but no,
I want to, uh, run indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I suck running indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd much rather run outdoors myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, it's pretty cool to be able to
walk in and have that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're flowering and the smell in
there and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a beautiful smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I got a couple more practical
questions for you too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, one, I actually got to talk to Kush of
the giants a little bit about beforehand,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, but I wanted to hear, uh, again,
the story.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, what are your considerations?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, do y'all grow in containers
or like bags or are you growing in the
[SPEAKER_04]: ground?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what are your considerations slash
experiences around, you know, growing in
[SPEAKER_04]: the ground versus growing in containers?
[SPEAKER_04]: containers or bags outdoors?
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush, do you want to start first?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I currently grow mostly in the 65
gallon fabric pots and it's, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: generally for ease of access.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if I had my preference, they would all
be in the ground, but the, the property is
[SPEAKER_01]: continually being worked on, um,
cleared for fire danger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had to move my little manzanita
patch three times now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, it's, um, what was the
question again?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, containers versus being in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your considerations?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and, and in previous years,
I would take the containers and bring them
[SPEAKER_01]: all up to the top of the plot and mix my
soil up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so it was easier to keep things
contained in the soil, uh, in these fabric
[SPEAKER_01]: pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this year I experimented and dug a
hole in the ground where I found an old
[SPEAKER_01]: petrified stump and, um, the, the new spot
that I cut out of the patch this year,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, feeling is more permanent permanent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'm probably going to be doing a
lot more holes in the ground rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: the 65 gallon fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the 65 gallons are kind of
restraining and constricting some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants natural to grow a bigger,
um, root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do like the pots for their
accessibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, um, being able to move them,
um, is, is really nice, especially when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not in growing in the same exact
area every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, I would much rather prefer the
ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you Denali?
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, I used to grow in a hundred gallon
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I personally thought that wasn't,
uh, I didn't need to use that much soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that other stuff that I can still
grow a plenty big enough plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I dropped the 65s and right now
I'm at 30s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with me planting late, um,
um, like I said, my plants just don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: that big, but I've always used,
uh, uh, uh, fabric pots were at least now
[SPEAKER_00]: what the last eight, 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I, I find them, uh, uh,
better, much better than plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, plastic, the sun hits it and just
cooks that side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave my train of thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll all do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of these days, you guys all do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, it just happened to me five minutes
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm the youngest person here.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it happens to everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's normal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Denali, what about growing in the
ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would much rather grow in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the best plants I grew from my
uncle's, uh, in early 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had dug right in the ground where
his dad had his old worm beds and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, out on an acre of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that was just prime soil and they
grew so nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's one thing that I do
know, the only thing I know about outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've learned from other people that I
didn't know, because I, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: growing indoor and plots, you don't really
learn this is that cannabis plants like to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow about what, two, one, a foot and a
half, two feet deep and then go outwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They prefer, yeah, they prefer the
horizontal growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like to get as, as wide as
they are going to be as Bush wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct too?
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it changes for some, like last year
that pure OG Kush, Kim dog, Irene hybrid
[SPEAKER_01]: was like 400%, 500% wider than the 65
gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The logistics behind it, when I look at
the photo, I'm like, I don't understand
[SPEAKER_01]: how that big of a plant came out of a 65
gallon pot, but in general, most,
[SPEAKER_01]: most plants like to stay within the curved
area that they're their roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you train them or purposely pull
them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a general rule of thumb is yeah,
they like to stay around the diameter of
[SPEAKER_01]: the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I always wondered like they're
deeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what if you dug six feet deep and,
and I think the CSI was telling me,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they, they like, it's kind of
pointless at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they like to spread outwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So going super deep doesn't do as much.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a, there's some dudes like a nuggy
Nick and there's a couple other IG cats.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have just two by fours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even, even two feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's like a, a 10 by 10 box with
less than a foot and a half of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're growing 20 foot tall plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are super healthy, super happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to ask Denali.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause he mentioned that he would,
he would prefer to grow in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: So are your considerations growing in pots
the same as Kush of the giants?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, are you doing it because it's just
more convenient, more accessible security?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, this ground is awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn hard hole and all that fact that I
actually thought about having come in,
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody come in and trench it,
you know, just long strips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but, uh, it just so easy with those,
uh, fabric plots, you know, and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to, you can move them, you know,
that's a consideration, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we, we're red flag here,
you know, you got five days to get your
[SPEAKER_00]: shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just might as well cut them.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least in pots, you might have a chance.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another big consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why I'm not in the ground completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: My substrate is lithified clay and
volcanic rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes me an hour or two to get an inch
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's not shoveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pickaxe work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, I have to pickaxe it apart and then
shovel out the rubble.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you live in concrete.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only, this is why you didn't want
to play Minecraft with us, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Play Minecraft in real life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Play Minecraft at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd rather play the quarry anyways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super meta.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that was a good insight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, both of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the lot, this is kind of like the last
practice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like quite practical question that I've
got before it opens up a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, how do y'all feed slash amend?
[SPEAKER_04]: Denali, you want to go first?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a big old pickle barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll fill up and, uh, depending on what
I'm using, you know, some years I've gone
[SPEAKER_00]: into done bottles and liquid formula and
then pH it and all that other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have the big old pickle barrel I use
and put a pump down in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll pump water out to the plants with
a garden hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they haven't just used it to dry
amendment and nature's pride and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: a grow and they have a bloom and it's
really easy and it doesn't clump up and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as far as amendments, I've used,
uh, uh, happy frog and see green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, uh, I'll mix them too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll add other stuff to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be you blends and, uh, uh, just other
nutrients, a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insic brass and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched Gale of enough and seeing the,
he'll put out what he puts in his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you just have to catch the post.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Matt, you're muted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two different mute buttons,
so I have to check.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, he's very transparent about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, it's very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's helped me a lot when I'm learning
about organic growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I guess I've never grown that way in
my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always been a bottle person and you
know, it's nice to be able to brush up on
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff from someone actually knows it
real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's honest, you know, he just being
real honest, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just a good dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like a lot of people don't know
you're one of the reasons me and Caleb
[SPEAKER_02]: ever even became friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Denali was the, the link between that
him and resin longboat, um, kind of pushed
[SPEAKER_02]: us together to, to be more collaborative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't take no credit for nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, how about you Kush with the giants
feeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me personally, what works really
well for me, um, my, when I, when I pile
[SPEAKER_01]: all my soil up together, it's around 650
or 700 gallons of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every three or four years,
I refresh it with, um, slow, slow
[SPEAKER_01]: breakdown amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a 50 pound bag of blood meal,
bone meal, kelp meal, alfalfa meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: crab meal, and a 30 pound bag of humic
acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all through veg, I'm essentially
just adding water and, uh, if the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are showing that they want more nitrogen,
or if there's not enough readily available
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, then I will brew some activated
aerated compost teas to, to spike,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, to spike some nitrogen and get things,
uh, heated back up in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the size of plants that I grow,
I noticed that yet about every two or
[SPEAKER_01]: three years, they suck those pots dry and
deplete pretty much everything out of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the ladies fade pretty hard and a lot
of my photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and if I need more than that,
if I need more than the activated aerated
[SPEAKER_01]: compost teas on top of the, the
pre-amendments and the soil, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes I will top dress with a pellet,
a chicken shit pellet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use only one type.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from Nutra Rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's like a four to two, um,
chicken pellets, a really hard pellet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you scatter it across the top of
your soil and water it down, it breaks
[SPEAKER_01]: down and tied up a muddy slur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and beyond that, um, in flower,
if I notice them liming up a little bit or
[SPEAKER_01]: asking for some more nutrients,
I'll go to something like, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Gaia green earth, um, the flowering
stuff, some, uh, maxi or some earth juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll do very little amounts of that if
the plants are asking for it, but
[SPEAKER_01]: generally most, mostly just having the
soil pre-amended and doing the activated
[SPEAKER_01]: compost teas does, does plenty of work on
these plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, anything anyone else wanted to say
about feeding amending folias?
Anyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to know from the Kush,
uh, how often do you look down on the tops
[SPEAKER_00]: of your plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, right around August, uh,
I stopped being able to look over them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the ones looking over me right
now, especially Matt's blue resin Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: How big is she now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say 10, but I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, maybe the top top spear is 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm going to have to get on a ladder
to get, I'm going to have to get on a
[SPEAKER_01]: ladder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they make ladders bigger than you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got some contractor ladders that I'll
have to fucking bring down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, that lady, man, that she's,
she's just doing all sorts of things that
[SPEAKER_01]: I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did not expect her to express in,
in the way that she did.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, I'm happy that she's,
she's going for the sky right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she's the tallest out of everybody
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so why Afghani blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the, with the fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you saw the post I did just the
other day that the, those two families,
[SPEAKER_01]: those things, the legacy fan leaves on the
second and third node.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Insane how big those are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminds me of the below cheese or
whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the big fucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prehistoric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jurassic fern style stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Kush used in that was the one that
Denali was referring to earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came from our buddy resin lung.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the one that his crew had held
since they were running the old,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, mansions back in the day in LA,
pushing OG Kush out of the mansions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where that cut came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, everything in that blue resin
Kush is testing super high, like 3% plus
[SPEAKER_02]: in Terps, but up to like seven,
you know, like crazy numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I'm really, really interested to
see what she's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She smells wonderful right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like sweet, sweet citrus blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if nothing else, I have a couple of
like more open-ended questions to round
[SPEAKER_04]: out, uh, our conversation today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Matt also wants to leave a bit of time
for a little review at the end that you,
[SPEAKER_04]: you, you two can join us, um, witnessing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first open question is I wanted to
hear about, uh, your kind of worst
[SPEAKER_04]: experiences outdoors, partly because it's
entertaining, partly because it's also
[SPEAKER_04]: informative for other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Denali, do you, I mean, we mentioned
pests earlier and some stories around
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, do you have anything comes to mind
when I say worst experiences outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I guess when I found out, uh,
my neighbor across the street,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, her, uh, son was a sheriff and,
uh, uh, this is, uh, this is, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: a no gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, so he's a, uh, uh, sheriff here
in the County and, uh, I met him and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: really worried he was going to tell me,
you know, can't do this every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was worried about he was going to change
cause he kept going up in the ranks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he never bothered me, but I worried
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm worried about that a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know like which way cops are
going to go, especially their neighbors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them will be growing right next to
you and, you know, arresting people during
[SPEAKER_02]: their day job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a guy that, uh, had one of these
dispensaries that they deliver in that and
[SPEAKER_00]: he, he was the ex head, mucky muck of the
department of fishing game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Busting, busting, outdoor illegal grows
and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: His guys would go out and, you know,
cut down, uh, plants and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, he's funding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did it for one of the senators or
something that, uh, had the money,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he could get the license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course he could.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I fucking hate politicians.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's disgusting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super disgusting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a budget.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you Kush?
[SPEAKER_04]: Worst experiences?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fail stories, worst experiences,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, honestly, the, the real big one comes
to mind is, uh, topping some cultivars
[SPEAKER_01]: that should not have been topped and what
it does to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I had it happen twice and it happened
with the deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I topped it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also did it with the Salmon
Creek big bud and it, it created such a
[SPEAKER_01]: short, stocky, jungly, bushy plant that it
became a chore to every day go in and
[SPEAKER_01]: clean out the inner growth, make sure she
could breathe, make sure she's literally
[SPEAKER_01]: not choking herself out because she's like
intertwined in the cage and intertwined in
[SPEAKER_01]: herself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some of my biggest fail stories would
be like just, you know, treating a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: not letting it naturally grow and learning
which cultivars, um, will do that and
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for the telltale signs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, good example of that was this year,
I popped some cream bag seed from my old
[SPEAKER_01]: super cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a black cherry soda hybrid that I'm
very, very ensconced with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, as it's growing and as it's,
as its stock is shooting up and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at this thing, that's like,
like four inches in diameter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I can't top this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I top this, the same exact thing is
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That happened to the deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just let it naturally Christmas
tree profile out and it's, it's performing
[SPEAKER_01]: much better than if I had topped it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a fail, but it was a lesson that
later taught me to, to pay attention to
[SPEAKER_01]: these things for these outdoor plants
that, Hey man, don't, don't top that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does release certain hormones into the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you top that, you know, some plants
will react well to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some won't, you know, and you just never
know until you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, one of the key things like,
if you know like indoor, if, if you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to know if a plant outdoor will react bad,
if you top it and it goes straight up with
[SPEAKER_02]: two poles, like straight up next to each
other, it's going to be one of the ones
[SPEAKER_02]: that's probably does not do well after all
the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the, uh, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Big Sur Holy Weed Triangle Kush last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I topped it and it bifurcated the stock
and went straight up in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called it twin towers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It literally was just identical branches
all the way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another fail was like, uh, one year,
I think it was 2018 when I was growing
[SPEAKER_01]: some, uh, lemon party or maybe in 2019,
I was growing lemon party S1s and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like week two of flower, week three of
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, man, I want to hit these
with some kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought that they could use the,
the, the boost and I hit them with too
[SPEAKER_01]: much kelp and they got burnt and they
never really recovered from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's another thing that I've
learned is like, if they're happy,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they look okay, you don't have to,
you don't have to force feed them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, sometimes, sometimes with the
outdoor grow, just letting the plants be
[SPEAKER_01]: helps in a lot of situations rather than
trying to over meticulously worry about
[SPEAKER_01]: every little thing with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's kind of a perfect segue
because the next question was going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: about, um, how have you both like observed
your approach to have changed over the
[SPEAKER_04]: years?
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously in talking about failure,
fails and all that, um, sometimes these
[SPEAKER_04]: are going to be the turning points or the
major learning points, um, that allow you
[SPEAKER_04]: to progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Denali, you know, you've been growing
what like that's like four, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: 40 years or so, like how, how do you see
your progress or journey as a grower and
[SPEAKER_04]: how, how has your approach changed over
the years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I still don't think I grow very good
weed now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I get like, 75%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's always got something more to
give that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I've ever seen a perfect
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I don't know where I'm going with
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how, what, how does your journey
changed?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like a, in the past, even five
years, it was, well, uh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, it changed immensely with computer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was an information back
then it was a few books in that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, yeah, it wasn't readily talked
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing like this, you know,
I didn't, even when the forums came out,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get involved with them because I
just thought these guys are crazy for
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about this stuff over this thing
that somebody has to be listening or being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to, you know, what's going where and
who's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just stayed away from it a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I logged onto them and I just was like,
nah, no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, uh, uh, so much has changed in
all them years, you know, from miracle
[SPEAKER_00]: grow job, all this stuff they have
nowadays and that, you know, you go into
[SPEAKER_00]: one of them nurseries and you better be
smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better know what you want because she
used cars.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a shoe store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some for everything and multiple
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I still think you can grow good weed,
just with basic amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think a lot of people overthinking,
you know, and, uh, they're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: that, uh, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I don't know if it's attainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this plant, uh, uh, always has
some more to give.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always a curve ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's some that are pretty damn
good now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but, uh, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, uh, Denali's staying humble,
you know, after 40 years, he's still
[SPEAKER_04]: learning.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot a lot of stuff, you know,
but I have this place here to come to and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still have some basic questions
because these guys know these guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: good growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, uh, anybody can't learn from
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I learn every day from, and I really,
I really, you know, thank Matt for
[SPEAKER_00]: starting this and getting this going and
introduce me to these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big change.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you, Kush?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just essentially a wholehearted
agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just like stay humble and like over
the years I've I've always said that like
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis next to bass fishing and deer
hunting are three of the most subjective
[SPEAKER_01]: topics that I've ever encountered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody thinks that their way is the
right way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an empirical fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've found my success by taking the
subjectivity out of it and, and looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are successful, seeing that
they're doing something different than me,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying that method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it works for my garden,
then I continue to apply it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't, then I don't apply it to my
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been doing that since day one
with an open mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like that's probably the best
way to tackle it is just always,
[SPEAKER_01]: always think that, you know, you're
probably, there's something more that you
[SPEAKER_01]: could be doing because it is so in depth
and it is so subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel personally, I could spend lifetimes
studying and learning about this plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: still come up short in considering myself
an expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think as long as we keep that
attitude, like, and keep our minds open to
[SPEAKER_01]: the possibilities, it's, it's the best
position that you could be, especially for
[SPEAKER_01]: an outdoor grower with the X factor of
your environment or the multiple X factors
[SPEAKER_01]: of your environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and that, you know, comes back to my
earlier disclaimer about grow information
[SPEAKER_04]: and how it's often framed on the internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, people like to pretend that they have
the authoritative or, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: ultimate guide to whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not an expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a fucking expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a, I'm a noob at this, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been growing since 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't know shit compared to a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people who could be
sitting here instead of me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think what's important,
you know, and what we covered today is
[SPEAKER_04]: again, just exposing how diverse the
approaches can be, how diverse the
[SPEAKER_04]: environments can be and the challenges
that come with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and there's never going to be,
you know, like Matt and I have been
[SPEAKER_04]: saying, even throughout the breathing
episodes, like there's no silver bullet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you just have to, um, like Kush and
Denali have both said, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially try stuff out, learn,
iterate again, and keep iterating like
[SPEAKER_04]: forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that's your dick in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dial it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just every year dial it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll get better every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you pay attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, anytime you turn out a fish,
big fella, you just get a hold of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking this fall, me and you,
we got to do a double date.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll hit your lake and then we'll hit my
lake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can hit the Kerr river.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bad river.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is man.
[SPEAKER_02]: People, people swim in that all the time
still, despite all the signs everywhere
[SPEAKER_02]: stayed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the beginning of the, uh, uh,
Canyon road, there's, there's a sign there
[SPEAKER_00]: with how many deaths there are each year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember when I believe it was in
the thirties and is in the 200 and
[SPEAKER_00]: something is now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have died in that river.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we, we have our, our scooter rallies
out right next to the river at a French
[SPEAKER_02]: gold campground out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know where it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each year we go out there and.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this year we, it was the first time
we've seen that river above like almost
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting the banks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were worried about the dam flooding
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, rivers flooded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a bad river.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice tangent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, one of the things that I
really want to talk about before we are
[SPEAKER_02]: done with push push of the giants,
um, is, uh, the cream, you mentioned it
[SPEAKER_02]: very briefly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this is the breeder syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just give a brief, brief,
or not even brief.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just talk about, um, your,
your fascination with the strain called
[SPEAKER_02]: black cherry soda and the cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, uh, sometime around 2010,
uh, I had a friend from the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a breeder and she offered me some
of her clones to try outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I got to try the black cherry soda
and I got to try this hybrid that she just
gave me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called cream and it was black cherry
soda cross to triple threat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as I can research, it's,
um, sour grapes to Afghani to unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the, the cream really just kind
of, it was one of those things that just
[SPEAKER_01]: fell into your lap and you don't know what
you have and how good it is until you lose
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, literally a plant that grew itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it had no external needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, it just did its thing and my
environment very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would have buyers that would buy
every crumb of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, um, it flowered out really fast early
in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd get this beautiful like vanilla,
like strong vanilla extract smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then week four or five, this citrus
orange would come in Mandarin orange,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you'd get the, uh, you know,
the old 50, 50 ice cream bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the exact smell you would get out
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, just one of my favorite profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I think I super cropped that or
monocropped that from 2010 to about 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nine years where I grew 14 of
those outdoor every year, trying to get
[SPEAKER_01]: two pounds off at each plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the buyer would literally buy every
crumb off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't realize, cause that's the
other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny too is I smoked mostly cream
during that session too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try stuff here and there and try a
single offshoot plant in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was mainly smoking that cream,
just being super complacent, not realizing
[SPEAKER_01]: that I had such a fantastic plant that I
could smoke it for so long and not get
[SPEAKER_01]: tired of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second I lost it,
it became super apparent to me how much,
[SPEAKER_01]: how, how fantastic she was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in, in losing her, you started your
journey into trying to recapture that in
[SPEAKER_02]: seed form?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it got me into, it literally put my
nose right into the, to the Breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: Syndicate episodes about reversal sprays
and, and, and taking your lines and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, making the, the,
the generations last.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, at the time that I had the cream,
I was very complacent, just cloning,
[SPEAKER_01]: re-mothering, and just super cropping this
plant in the back of my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was never thinking about propagating
this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't, I didn't think that
re-cloning it and re-mothering it so much
[SPEAKER_01]: would cause genetic issues later down the
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, it just wasn't in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't something I was paying attention
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so it got me into, it got me
looking into what I should be doing as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as breeding and in case I run into
something like that again in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily I found some old trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some bag seed of the old cream from
2016 and I got, had a male and a female
[SPEAKER_01]: come up this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took out the male, but took clones of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the clones are rooted.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took clones of the female.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got this, this bag seed
representation and yeah, she's,
[SPEAKER_01]: she's a little chunkier than what I'm used
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that would, you know,
that she's, she's got a different
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypical experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Expression a little bit, but she has that
vanilla where we're in week two,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost, you know, two and a half weeks of
flower and that vanilla, it's literally
[SPEAKER_01]: emanating vanilla smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I'm in nostalgia heaven right now
with this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, two strains that I immediately
think of when you talk about it are West
[SPEAKER_02]: coast dog, which is popular up in your
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very much like vanilla bean
smelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe someone renamed it Madagascar
vanilla bean for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And agent orange, agent orange is right.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few times I've seen a seed line that
produced 50, 50 bar turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a name I haven't heard in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: TGA agent orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the people often confused my
clockwork orange with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people would be like, Oh, you're the
dude who made agent orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd have to disappoint them and be
like, no, no, I made the clockwork orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, Oh, I don't know what
that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, it had a beautiful 50,
50 bar taste and smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that's always stood
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause in the world of oranges,
I'm not a huge fan unless it is that 50,
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 bar sweet orange green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the citrus that I run into,
it's not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't find a lot of pure orange citrus
strong, um, as compared to lemon citrus
[SPEAKER_01]: or, or lime citrus, much, much different
than the orange citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Cali orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like the Calio?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the Calio when I, uh, first time I
smelled the guy came in and it just
[SPEAKER_00]: reeked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just thought that was some of the
best stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an old pack that I found from Dutch
Passion to California orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should pop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: See it.
[SPEAKER_02]: See if you like them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had that in years and years and
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the last orange I had was your
orange cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was mostly cookies dominant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was good though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did good with that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: My, uh, my buddy did the California gold
rush from Caleb last year, the Calio to
[SPEAKER_01]: train wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, how was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an amalgamation of really large
buds and just turpentine and citrus
[SPEAKER_01]: orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, it, it was, it was a heady
plant, big buds, but airy, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: not, not real dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: He made a lemon party Calio too,
which I was like, Oh my God, that's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost offensively citrus to the point,
like lemon orange to the point of where it
[SPEAKER_02]: might not even be smokable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so oily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who's after lemon turps go to the
lemon party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, S ones, everything that I popped it
just starburst yellow, um, bubba head,
[SPEAKER_01]: bub, uh, not bubba head, the, uh,
lemon head candy, um, turps were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and my favorite was one that leaned a
little sativa and it was like black tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lemon, it was like a hashy hazy,
um, tea, black tea mixed in with a lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I thought like lemon black tea every
time I smelled this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is that, is that us before the
review, Matt?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah, I guess we could do the review
since we're talking about lemon,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And recently we had a, we had a person
join our, our, uh, server briefly,
[SPEAKER_02]: very briefly that talked about a cut
called lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was talking about how this cut just
one cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the bomb, you know, another gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lately I've been on my quest to,
um, update my, my knowledge of current
[SPEAKER_02]: availability of flower strains and flower
form, um, in the hype market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, strains that I normally wouldn't
pay attention to or smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to force myself into
learning about, uh, maybe opening my eyes,
[SPEAKER_02]: broadening my horizons as it were to see
what some of the kids were smoking these
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I decided lemon cherry gelato,
uh, would be the, the next choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I wrote down some notes real
quick when I was smoking it on not first
[SPEAKER_02]: the scent, you know, the flavor profile,
the high any, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when, when I get a strain called lemon
cherry, that's going to be the first thing
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm looking for when I smoke it or
even smell the bud, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does it smell like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it smell like lemon or cherry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the name infer anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, smelling it when, I mean, it had a
decent scent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't like unscented.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, um, I could tell that it had some
kind of OG in it, but the dominant scent
[SPEAKER_02]: was mostly gelato, not really sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, as, as I, first I, I smoked it with a
lighter and I was getting from the
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors, earthy chocolate for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some floor cleaner like OG,
hopsy, not unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting for a gelato, but it tasted
exactly like a well-grown OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_02]: which from the smell I knew that would be
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not think that would be the dominant
flavor when combusted was just like
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking a really good OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, with that said, there was no lemon or
cherry of any sort combusting it for me
[SPEAKER_02]: personally in this grow of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously depends who grows it,
how they grow it, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it did have a unique, almost woodsy
smell with a sweet earthy chocolate,
[SPEAKER_02]: almost like Bubba, um, in the background,
like how Bubba can be kind of chocolatey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, it tasted like OG Kush all
the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the, the most important part of it
would be the high, which lasted a total of
[SPEAKER_02]: 13.
[SPEAKER_02]: Minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be the, um, the least length of a
high, because I could feel I was high at
[SPEAKER_02]: first.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't like it didn't hit at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't like a Blackberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was non-existent, but it was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I counted it like, okay, I've marked it
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoked right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Within 13 minutes, it was totally gone and
I had to smoke again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I've been sitting here with the,
uh, rip, you know, sitting here with,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the rip, um, they can get in this
throughout the episode because ripping,
[SPEAKER_02]: it gives you a whole different flavor
profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It, you're getting a lot of the volatiles
that burn up immediately when you combust
[SPEAKER_02]: it, you'll never taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: You taste them this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so what I wrote down during,
and this is while we were doing this,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was writing it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the loudest flavor by far is the
lemon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whereas combusting, I tasted no lemon,
nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This tasted completely like lemon,
like all upfront lemon, um, floor cleaner,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, like Goji Kush would, um,
but extreme lemon, extreme lemon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the lemon name is accurate per vaping,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the high was much brighter,
clearer and more energetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually really liked the high from it,
but it lasted like 10, 13 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just curious at this point,
and, uh, with Denali and Kush here,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, do you two, what are your primary
modes of like ingesting like joints,
[SPEAKER_04]: glass?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you, do either of you vape as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, uh, I like bombs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like water filtered.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a prototype shower head glass piece
that I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've smoked out of a lot of pieces,
but nothing beats the shower head park
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just saying, I was just going to say
that like, um, it is interesting what
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt's pointing out, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That vaping obviously can be quite a
different experience, especially when it
[SPEAKER_02]: comes to the, yeah, smell and flavor and
high high is so different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even explain to you how different
the high is from, um, from using the brick
[SPEAKER_02]: versus combustion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, you know, some people say that
vaping doesn't get them high at all,
[SPEAKER_02]: whereas I think it gets me so much more,
um, so much more high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's way more complex, way more
complex of a high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like I said in combusting this,
it had a decent high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it wasn't like, um, it wasn't anything
better than a normal gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like as far as high vaping, it was much
more energetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was clear headed, but it was obviously
there and it was pleasant kind of giggly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's a totally different experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I highly recommend everybody give both
a try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a rating system yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, do we want stars?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want buds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want, and how many four or five,
where are we going guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to start a rating system guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Help me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five stars, five buds, five stars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The stars for now we can think of what
else it can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will give this a three out of five
because it got me high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a decent high, but it loses two
stars for lasting 10 to 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I already wanted to have some
diamonds or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my review on lemon cherry
gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best strain ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: According to some.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, thank you both so much,
uh, for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it was a really cool conversation and
I think we covered a lot of territory.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, shout out to rings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Poor guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, he was meant to join us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I think we'll take that L,
uh, we messed up a bit with the
[SPEAKER_04]: coordination.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but we hope to have him on again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was clear from just talking to
you both today that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's so much that we could say on
outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: This may not be the last time we have this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully we can get rings back,
but otherwise, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, great to have Denali on finally,
finally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and yeah, great to hear from Chris of
the giants as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like fantastic information from both of
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Denali, do you want to give any shout outs
to anyone in the syndicate on the
[SPEAKER_02]: syndicate discourse?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there are, there are people
there who absolutely love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anyone you want to shout out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, our whole crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everybody in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of got to like him for this Carlos
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carlos isn't bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not a bad guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that guy a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endo.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good dude.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but they're all good over there,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of knowledgeable people over there,
you know, uh, sheets, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, uh, yeah, there's a lot of good
people you put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meeting Kush is a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he's a giant, but he's a sweetheart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm already short and he really,
oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he can, and he can, all right,
Christian, the giants, you got anything
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to shout out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just, uh, just a big thank you to
everybody in the syndicate and especially
[SPEAKER_01]: to you, Matt, for, for bringing me into
the fold and, you know, just treating me
[SPEAKER_01]: like family.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a huge reminder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I said this before, but it's,
it's a huge reminder of how important
[SPEAKER_01]: community is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was very complacent in past years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that I'm brushing shoulders with,
with some of these guys, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you need to step your game up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be doing better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like, I like when I get motivated.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do more because the people around me
are just as excited and endeavor it into
[SPEAKER_01]: this, this thing that we all love.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's iron sharpening iron for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody in that group does make me want
to be a better person.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be a better human being for
everyone around me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, thank you bastards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for taking your time
and, uh, both of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been an absolute pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, yeah, you got anything thousand
you want to say?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think I, I think I've said
everything I want to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, maybe we'll see you two back at some
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
