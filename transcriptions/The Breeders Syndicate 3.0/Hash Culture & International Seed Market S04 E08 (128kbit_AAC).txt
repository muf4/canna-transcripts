[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_01]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-So-Dog, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting and like the hash thing,
you know, the hash thing is kind of cool
[SPEAKER_04]: because you can, we can widen it out a
little bit in the sense of, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and talk about like some traditional weed
cultures because there is a real divide in
[SPEAKER_04]: weed cultures between cultures that grew
weed primarily to make hashish and
[SPEAKER_04]: cultures that grew weed primarily to smoke
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that aspect and those
choices made a lot of differences for
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now for a long time, America,
one of the benefits of America is that
[SPEAKER_04]: we're isolated from everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have like big oceans on either side and
all that, but we're very far away from the
[SPEAKER_04]: hash culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So traditionally, all the best hash sort
of stays local.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some small amount of it would go
to Europe.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what America typically got was the B
and C grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so a lot of times Americans,
especially Canadians are a little
[SPEAKER_04]: different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Canadians had some better connections and
some better smuggling that happened up
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they sometimes saw a little bit better
of a grade, but Americans, especially,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they, we got the shaft as far as
high grade.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of people think of, imagine if
your view of Kind Bud was like Beasters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what you thought it was,
because that's the only thing you've
[SPEAKER_04]: experienced.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people, if you haven't been to
Europe and you haven't been tied into
[SPEAKER_04]: those communities, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably haven't smoked the best of
the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's a lot of hash people in
America that think like the last 10 or 14
[SPEAKER_04]: years of sort of like the hash revolution
that's happened over here, that they have
[SPEAKER_04]: the best hash by far, that they blow away
all the traditional cultures by far and
[SPEAKER_04]: that they're kind of on the cutting edge
and they've changed the game and they
[SPEAKER_04]: figured it out and nobody else did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is pretty far from the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so it's like a lot of those
things where, you know, we can,
[SPEAKER_04]: we can kind of riff on that for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe you can kind of talk,
we can, we can start like, maybe we'll,
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll, we'll start from the beginning
where it's like the hash culture sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: comes from the, I would say the,
the Near East and the Middle East.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say Indian, Indian culture,
India, Chinese, maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and, and probably the old,
probably the oldest way to smoke cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: before they even figured out how to smoke
flour besides like burning flowers on
[SPEAKER_04]: brassieres or something is the hand rub.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and that India, Pakistan,
Afghanistan, Iran, the Middle East,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can go into like Lebanon and Israel
and those areas and you can go through
[SPEAKER_04]: North Africa all the way to Morocco and
that's sort of hash culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in terms of like people grew weed to
make, to turn weed into hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where you start getting into like
Southeast Asia and, you know, and
[SPEAKER_04]: especially the new world like Mexico and
Columbia and Panama and these types of
[SPEAKER_04]: places and Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They mostly smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, one that, that,
that caught me off guard was Nepal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always think of like Nepalese temple
balls and that kind of hash culture,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if I remember correctly, when I was
studying it, most of it was a flour
[SPEAKER_02]: culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was most, it was, it was a little bit
of both.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but, you know, and so to be,
to perfectly honest, like when I started
[SPEAKER_04]: going to Amsterdam, I went there in search
of seats.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and then I started getting
introduced to hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I smoked a bunch of stuff,
but in the coffee shops, it's a lot like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's a lot like dispensaries or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a wide variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of mids and junk and really good and
pretty decent and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wasn't until I met collectors that
started explaining to me like how it all
[SPEAKER_04]: worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's an aspect, maybe we can,
maybe I could talk for a minute about,
[SPEAKER_04]: before we talk about the regional
differences for a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I could talk about like something
that we chat about often, which is the
[SPEAKER_04]: vast difference between how traditional
hash is made and how American hash is
[SPEAKER_04]: made.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the American hash, the way it's made in
most cases is it's, you know, it's a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of times it's called single source,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a single clone, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Grown in either depths or altitudes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alt or indoor or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that single clone is usually,
you know, dried or fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's, you know, it's processed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's usually refrigerated or
frozen right away or stored well until
[SPEAKER_04]: use.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's used pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where in traditional hash culture,
you're harvesting a field of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, in America, it's like,
oh, I'm going to pull down this
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all for lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all GMO.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all the same cut, you know,
same terpene profile, same CBD,
[SPEAKER_04]: CBN, THC, all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're, if you're harvesting it
from any other region, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_04]: the full range of expression of that line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're harvesting thousands of
sisters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're processing those sisters.
[SPEAKER_04]: And unlike, unlike, if you're,
if you're talking about like dry sift and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff like that, they tend to let that
hash age.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the plant for a number of months.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when it's cold and bone dry,
they start a sifting process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then from that sifting process,
you know, then they make it into various
[SPEAKER_04]: grades and then they press it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's not done in America at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of your, all of your terp shit,
all of your, whether it's fresh frozen or
[SPEAKER_04]: it's, you know, BHO or it's, it's you
know, whatever extraction you're doing,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's usually single source.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not aged.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually the plant is taken down fresh and
as soon as they can make the hash,
[SPEAKER_04]: they make the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, I'm not exactly the
expert on the science or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: but definitely aging it creates,
you know, it, it transfers things from one
[SPEAKER_04]: to the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Certain amounts of CBN or CBD or this or
that, or whatever is converted into other
[SPEAKER_04]: bioactives, whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on top of that, when we've wanted
to get our buddy Bodhi on here for a long
[SPEAKER_04]: time to do like a hippie hashish trail
kind of episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we might get more in depth with
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when, essentially when Europeans and
white people first started going to the
[SPEAKER_04]: hash regions and looking for export,
most hash, there was a lot of hash that
[SPEAKER_04]: was one, two, three years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a lot of the best hashish wasn't
smoked until it was over a year or two
[SPEAKER_04]: years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yikes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's just different climate
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was stored, it was stored very
differently, you know, and they just
[SPEAKER_04]: thought that it was, it was not like it
wasn't ready yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, and what's interesting about this
is that if you go to Amsterdam and you
[SPEAKER_04]: have all these people that have all the
same access to all the same tech that we
[SPEAKER_04]: do here, as far as extracting modern
cultivars for hashish.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all the hash heads over there will
tell you that the best hash that they
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke is the top import.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can use pollinators.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can use tumblers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can fresh froze and freeze dry and
microplane and do all the tricks that
[SPEAKER_04]: people win awards with over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they still think that hash is inferior
in quality and effect to the best of the
[SPEAKER_04]: best import.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, but in America,
we all think that our shit is the best
[SPEAKER_04]: shit ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, as soon as we invented the nail
and we invented some modern ways of hash
[SPEAKER_04]: smoking in 2009, you know, 2010,
2011, that that was the revolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hash went from shitty to amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, it's true that most Americans got
shitty hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's also true that when all these
white people and all these Europeans and
[SPEAKER_04]: all these Americans and Brotherhood of
Eternal Love and all these assholes
[SPEAKER_04]: started coming to these regions to look
for hash and started offering crazy
[SPEAKER_04]: amounts of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The quality went way down.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: People started adulterating.
[SPEAKER_04]: People started middlemen started making it
worse.
[SPEAKER_04]: People wanted volume because there was so
much demand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of times the best stuff never
leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even like even my friends in Amsterdam who
are very tied in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Them getting the best of the best is
really hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would imagine so.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they and they savor it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They absolutely savor it and they hold on
to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it never makes the you know,
I almost said clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It never it almost never makes the the
coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's all traded amongst each
other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all bought and sold that kind of
grade.
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of have to know someone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's no different than like if you if
Fritz mentioned him again, if Bodhi gave
[SPEAKER_04]: out some like 14 week amazing sativa,
you probably wouldn't be able to buy it
[SPEAKER_04]: from the cookie store.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you'd have to have a home.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd have to have a homie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, well, maybe now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But but even someone even something that
takes that long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in Europe, you know, there's there's
still like I have a buddy over there right
[SPEAKER_04]: now that was texting me on what to get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, I didn't tell you this, but he just
bought some CG 13 and some C5 and some and
[SPEAKER_04]: some A5 from over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those, you know, those are 15,
16 week strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's unheard of to get in a
dispensary over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: But over there, it's their bread and
butter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so you can find that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the biggest just to reiterate before we
get too off track, the biggest differences
[SPEAKER_04]: between American hash and like the best
traditional is, you know, the what I was
[SPEAKER_04]: told by the the Amsterdam crews is like
the best stuff is made in traditional
[SPEAKER_04]: regions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Westerners help them to make sure that
the purity and the process is amazing.
OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: So making their technique more purifying,
making making sure that the cleanliness,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and the technique and all that
is good screens and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, people one of the reasons
why people ask this is people ask about
[SPEAKER_04]: temple balls.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: These Nepalese temple balls.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will say that these Nepalese temple
balls that I smoked from my buddy was some
[SPEAKER_04]: of the best hash I've ever smoked in my
life.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's interesting because a lot of
people over there feel that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they feel that like there's something
to the fact that like a lot of this stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: is being grown at six or seven or eight
thousand feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the air is thinner and there's more
UV.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe that leads to a different type
of psychoactive or a different type of THC
[SPEAKER_04]: production.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they would say that like,
you know, our buddy Yosemite, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: would say, I don't care what modern
cultivar you have.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care what amazing cut you think
you have or how pure you make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it shits the bed next to the
best temple ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you can get the best of the best,
he's like just in flavor and effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And effect is hard to say because it's
invisible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got used to making all these modern
cultivars and thinking that like thousands
[SPEAKER_04]: of years of hash culture, we just beat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're a little cleaner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we got a little bit better and we
have a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some machinery and we're a little
bit better process.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like old timers will tell you that
like they think that putting your hash in
[SPEAKER_04]: the in the in the fridge ruins it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's weird about the Nepalese stuff is I
will say that this is an old thing.
It's a nice little one because it smells a
lot like a burr.
Yeah, no, it's a burr.
It's a nice little thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think I even I don't know if
you can put a plug on it or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: but anything I've ever smelled that
smelled like the Mendo perps that I
[SPEAKER_04]: cracked had the Mendo perps in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the sense that like I've never smelled
that terpene profile from any other plant
[SPEAKER_04]: that wasn't it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless it was related to it in the sense
that like someone bred with it or it was
[SPEAKER_04]: it was an ancestor of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Except these temple balls that I smoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they smell when you were burning them,
they smelled like you were burning Mendo
[SPEAKER_04]: perps.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you know, does that mean that like
the Mendo P is Nepalese?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but or does it mean that it just
evoked that terpene profile?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I can't say.
[SPEAKER_04]: But all those guys over there,
what's crazy is that all those hash heads
[SPEAKER_04]: over there, they grow all kinds of
phenomenal weed and they sell all that
[SPEAKER_04]: weed to buy the best hash they can get.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and like somebody like somebody
like, you know, when you were interviewing
[SPEAKER_04]: Kamara and Red, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, he was saying that like,
you know, he's never even seen Sam
[SPEAKER_04]: Skunkman smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That, you know, the the top people over
there are Hashishians.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're resin farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's what they're after.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're after a resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, we could widen that out
for a little bit and talk about how,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, this is like a totally different
tangent or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when Americans started smoking weed,
we were a flower culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were getting weed from Mexico and
Panama and Jamaica and Colombia and all
[SPEAKER_04]: these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were getting bricked and we were
getting, you know, we were getting bricked
[SPEAKER_04]: of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we started blending them with Afghans
because of prohibition.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's super common.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Matt can speak on this, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But most of the weed smokers back then
were very disappointed in the smoke of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't really like the high and they
didn't really like the way it burned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was so vastly different than
what they were used to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Compared to compared to sativas,
because those sativas have been have been
[SPEAKER_04]: bred for smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were bred for they were bred to be
burned as flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, where I mean, I told this
before, but there's this funny story of
[SPEAKER_04]: when Sam Scuntman was in was in
Afghanistan and he was searching for
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he was asking these warlords for
seeds for flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and they looked at him and they
said, you know, smoking flowers for women
[SPEAKER_04]: and slaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you a woman or a slave?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had to convince them that he was a
man and he just wanted them so he could
[SPEAKER_04]: grow his own flour at home and make resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if he pulled that as wiener.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and let me prove it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but to them, it was like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was that was the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The flour was a waste product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, peasants and women, slaves and
women smoked smoked flour, real men.
[SPEAKER_04]: Men smoked hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was their culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So obviously, you don't care how flour
burns and you don't care how the flour
[SPEAKER_04]: affects you because you never smoke it in
that culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Americans were the first people taking
all these hash plants and Afghans and
[SPEAKER_04]: actually wanting to smoke them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It hadn't happened before because none of
those people back back home where they
[SPEAKER_04]: were from gave a shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can kind of draw a line.
[SPEAKER_04]: From Morocco on the western part of
Africa, all throughout North Africa,
[SPEAKER_04]: all the way up through Lebanon and Israel,
all the way over Iran and into
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all hash.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then once you get to like Cambodia,
Thailand, that all kind of got lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it flipped into weed smoking and
exporting actual weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I wonder why.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder why.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why that one became so
separate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you know, and you know,
it's like I prefer flour, too,
[SPEAKER_04]: to be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think that we need to like
base what what what we think of on what
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghans think.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, definitely they,
you know, they just thought that because
[SPEAKER_04]: that was the culture that they were
raised.
[SPEAKER_04]: Men smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and women smoke flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't good enough for hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Women were puffing tough on the flour over
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, and so there's this thing
where when I first went over to Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_04]: I met this guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's still over there, Steve the nose or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got introduced to some of this
hashish culture and they would show me the
[SPEAKER_04]: best Moroccan, the best Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are amazing temple balls.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from the Pakistani highlands.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you smoke all this stuff and it's
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he had the best hash collection I've
ever seen in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these guys, they didn't even really
smoke weed very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they mostly cared about hashish.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and they thought they didn't
care what method you used.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't care what extraction technique
you had.
[SPEAKER_04]: All those cuts that you could make hash
off of.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were inferior.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was inferior hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and so we knew you there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, they.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really a big.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really interesting because Americans
like until things open up, I would say
[SPEAKER_04]: that 99 percent of Americans have probably
never smoked the top import grade of hash
[SPEAKER_04]: that you can get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't show up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets it barely gets to Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before it gets absorbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a lot of people asking about the
opium thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can comment on that real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: What they're referring to is an old story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a weed thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was necessarily it wasn't necessarily a
weed thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The story was that tie sticks were dipped
in something called Passawater,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was the water used when you produce
heroin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're when you're doing the
conversion from opium to heroin,
[SPEAKER_02]: the leftover water is called Passawater.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was theories or people would
spread stories that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: all tie sticks were dipped in Passawater,
and that's why they were so strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: When in reality, it probably wasn't the
case.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not really how how the the water
works drying onto to weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but it that that is stuff
forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that a lot of people think that tie
sticks have heroin in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's yeah, that's where that came
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, they don't mostly because I
think if it happened, it would have been
[SPEAKER_04]: very real.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the reason why is because cartels
like that, they don't put more expensive
[SPEAKER_04]: drugs on cheaper ones for free.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not how that's not how they
operate.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, you know, now with like
the whole fentanyl thing and all that,
[SPEAKER_04]: there are people are cutting all kinds of
stuff with highly dangerous substances.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, back in the day, if anything got cut
with anything, it was by something cheaper
[SPEAKER_04]: and weaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I still am very skeptical on on
street fentanyl being cut into normal
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's still more expensive,
I would imagine than most of the drugs are
[SPEAKER_02]: saying that it's cut with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really make sense unless people
are trying to buy fentanyl and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting it with shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But cheaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to I'm going to reiterate it one
more time, just because I think it's
[SPEAKER_04]: really important is that almost all
traditional hash, regardless of grade or
[SPEAKER_04]: quality, is made out of thousands and
thousands and thousands of sister plants
[SPEAKER_04]: grown from seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you get a very wide range of that
that strains profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: THC, CBD, CBN, terpenes, all that kind of
stuff, it all gets blended together.
Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's vastly different than growing
a room or growing a greenhouse of GMO or
[SPEAKER_04]: skittles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or something along those lines and taking
the exact same genetic cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that exact same genetic cut and and
and extracting that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just very different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way they process it is different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how long that it takes them before
they think it's cured into something that
[SPEAKER_04]: they want to smoke is also different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So American hash culture is very new.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it goes against the grain as far as
like any other kinds of hashish culture
[SPEAKER_04]: that you would that you would you would
see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, it is true, of course, that with with
demand, right, they're going to mix all
[SPEAKER_04]: cut brokers and people looking for profit
are going to mix all kinds of cut into
[SPEAKER_04]: hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about the nicest stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about the pure grade.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hash in these regions was a lot better
before all these white people showed up
[SPEAKER_04]: demanding tons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once all these Europeans and all
these English and all these Americans
[SPEAKER_04]: started showing up on the hippie hashish
trail in the 70s, and they wanted just
[SPEAKER_04]: enormous amounts of it, they blew through
all the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, just like any other
humans, you're going to get a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: people that are trying to meet demand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the quality on average is going to go
way down and you're going to get a bunch
[SPEAKER_04]: of B and C grade.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're going to get, you know,
and then you're going to get, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the the top end is going to be a lot more
rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and, you know, like I said,
all those old timers that smoke hash,
[SPEAKER_04]: they all swear that the best traditional
hash is still the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, whether that's because of the strains
they use, whether that's because they dry
[SPEAKER_04]: farm it, you know, I mean, I'm sure
there's a bunch of different reasons,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the process itself is very different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the effect is very different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they they all they all swear by it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what they take the best of what
they grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and that and people say that,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: People say I see that all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a buddy of mine that was like,
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, they know what
[SPEAKER_04]: they're fucking talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: They fucking make cash with the same half
the hand they fucking wipe their shit on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's basically like these people,
these humans that have spent thousands of
[SPEAKER_04]: years refining their hash culture don't
know shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: From what we've learned since oh,
wait on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And different cultures.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gone we've gone through everybody
dabs with a fucking thousand degree
[SPEAKER_04]: glowing cherry red hot nail or banger.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unpurged B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every two or three years, we're like
improving our technique.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you only have to go back five or six
or seven years to techniques and shit that
[SPEAKER_04]: people wouldn't do again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You already get out of style that we
learned that a bunch of these terpenes are
[SPEAKER_04]: like carcinogenic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the heat that most of these people were
dabbing them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: With.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other thing, too,
is when you watch, you know, you can get
[SPEAKER_04]: on IG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can watch some of these hash
cultures work and how they keep the hash
[SPEAKER_04]: and how they work the hash, you know,
and how they get the hash malleable and
[SPEAKER_04]: how they get the the resin to be warm
before they use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, all that different types of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like and so there's a lot to learn
from those people.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because they've been smoking
hash for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and like we you know,
we stumble upon all this stuff and we
[SPEAKER_04]: think we're doing amazing because you can
see through, you know, we want to put it
[SPEAKER_04]: on a piece of parchment paper and be able
to see through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to make it off fresh frozen,
harvested, fresh frozen, put into this
[SPEAKER_04]: thing, put through a freezer dryer,
all this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, you know, Frenchy people
talking about Frenchy and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he did bring a little bit of the of of
of that different culture into all this,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's an aspect of, you know,
the the old timers will tell you that you
[SPEAKER_04]: would store the hash in like in loose
bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a cold spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said if you wanted to ruin your
hash, you put it in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fridge and the humidity and the
bullshit would ruin your fucking hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were like, if you wanted to ruin it,
just just do that to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you put it into a cold,
dry cellar and you let it age for a while,
[SPEAKER_04]: boom, it would get better.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and, you know, and so and they
also grow with a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivars that we're not used to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's very true, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and, you know, and they,
you know, they grow from seed every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: We grow from clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we've gotten really, especially on
the West Coast, you know, we've gotten
[SPEAKER_04]: really egotistical about our hash making
and about our extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are, you know, we are doing better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not I'm not saying like what we do
isn't viable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying that, like from the people
in Amsterdam that have vast experience
[SPEAKER_04]: with both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all prefer the traditional shit if
they can get the grade they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that should say something.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are asking the title of the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone did point out the churning app
maybe isn't so well liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is with Lawrence Cherniac and
Alan Dronkers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called how she used the joy of making
and curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's I was just putting up some pictures
to illustrate as we were talking about how
[SPEAKER_02]: she's the different styles, looks,
techniques in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, people used to sit there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if you can see my hand or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like you can say they would sit there
and rub and rub and work and work and work
[SPEAKER_04]: and really get the hash warm and
malleable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes people would put it into a
plastic bag and they would put it in the
[SPEAKER_04]: heel of their shoe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they would walk on it to like work and
work and work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they wouldn't just sit there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll see videos on IG now because
there's people that are going around
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghanistan and Pakistan and some of these
hash cultures of how before they use it,
[SPEAKER_04]: they heat it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They work it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get it to be they get it to be a
certain way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of there's a lot of
there's a lot of old techniques that I
[SPEAKER_04]: think are kind of being ignored.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That you know, it's almost like this shit
where like in California in the 70s,
[SPEAKER_04]: people knew about red and white wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that was that that was the level
of knowledge that like red went with with
[SPEAKER_04]: prime rib and meat, you know, and white
was for their wife and went with fish or
[SPEAKER_04]: chicken or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's about all they knew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you fast forward 30 years or 40
years or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's like they're like,
oh, Merlot and this Appalachian and the
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinot Gris that's that, you know,
that that's that's all going on and
[SPEAKER_04]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I think the same thing is
going to happen with hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a baby hash culture in America.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't know shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're learning stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every few years you can see hash
culture and you can see people's
[SPEAKER_04]: techniques improve.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we could learn a lot from,
you know, and maybe they'll get to a point
[SPEAKER_04]: like with the legality of things or
whatnot where you could grow a field.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it would be cool for seed makers,
right, where you could grow a field of of
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then harvest the whole thing for hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get the full range of
whatever, you know, Matt's bubble berry or
[SPEAKER_04]: or, you know, a Skittles hybrid or a GMO
hybrid or whatever the case may be.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd get the full range in the hash
instead of just like this one cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to concentrate what's in this
one cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's never been done before.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not typically how it's done over
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not typically how it's done over
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we have we have our own thing and
it's not bad or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying that, but it it's very
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's very different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we could expand it out a little bit
and talk about when when they first
[SPEAKER_04]: started bringing Afghans, you know,
we all started growing sativa in America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because sativa seeds came free with the
fucking wheat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get kilos of, you know, headstache
brought in and everyone's selling it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your weed came with free seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to sit there in high school
leaning back against the chair and we'd
[SPEAKER_04]: have a we'd have a tray and you'd break up
the weed up here and you'd let all the
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds and stems roll down and you keep and
you keep your weed up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But hash didn't come with free seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was just watching someone tell a joke
about Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_04]: We so we don't have we don't we don't we
didn't get very many seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, sativas were all everywhere
everywhere in the 70s and 80s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was primarily what it all was.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you think Puck washes?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I think like, man, you know,
if you want to if you want if there's
[SPEAKER_04]: people out there that don't like me and
you want to think of me as a shitty
[SPEAKER_04]: grower, I should show you some pictures of
my Puck Rose because I did some I did some
[SPEAKER_04]: depths and I did some greenhouse outdoors
with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And boy, was it not impressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't wash it because there would be
no reason to wash off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it was it was a really ugly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can't say what it looked like in
the 80s or in the 90s when it was a little
[SPEAKER_04]: younger.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, when I got it, it hated
sunlight and food.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, strangely enough,
those were two things that I like to give
[SPEAKER_04]: my plants sunlight and food.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, yeah, it was it was really
unusual.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they so there's, you know,
bubble hash and there's another aspect of
[SPEAKER_04]: it, too, where it's like maybe we should
we could talk about this for a second is
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people, most most Americans,
I was going to say white people,
[SPEAKER_04]: but most Americans will say it that way,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like we don't like our time is our
time is money.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so you look at the way
traditional people sift sifting is an
[SPEAKER_04]: amazing product, but it's the most time
consuming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it gets the least yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the rarest.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Americans are constantly looking for
can I wash this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I BHO it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I see what what way can I do it that's
efficient and I can get an extraction that
[SPEAKER_04]: yields?
[SPEAKER_04]: What how can I get yield?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, most of the time you have to put
that through a solvent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just knocking the flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over a screen and getting and getting dry
sift and then putting that dry sift
[SPEAKER_04]: through a series of screens and cleaning
it up like bubble man is as shown.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even water is a salt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water is the original solvent.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it's so funny that people call
water solventless.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water hash is solventless.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, look, put in is water a solvent into
Google and see what comes up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a solvent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure is the original.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's crazy about that is if you read
now, granted, there's a lot of there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: there's some THC and terpenes and stuff
like that aren't soluble in water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is if you read like,
Rob Clark's book, a sheesh, about 25% of
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes are water soluble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's times when we did stuff with
water hash, right, where you run something
[SPEAKER_04]: like some kind of tangy cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that and that citrus, that citrus
comes through super strong.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you run something like the 56 day
headband, and it comes out smelling like
[SPEAKER_04]: axle grease.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's super potent.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like chemical process didn't like
it's the chain that makes up the aroma and
[SPEAKER_04]: the taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, make it through the hash making
process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So most of the stuff we do today,
whether it's BHO or whether it's water
[SPEAKER_04]: hash and then frozen or this or that,
a lot of these things affect the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of what becomes popular is what
keeps its flavor with the time saving
[SPEAKER_04]: techniques that we use to make hash
extraction easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, you watch you watch
these guys like on IG or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: then you see them do their traditional
hash thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: No American wants to be sitting there with
a face mask on for eight hours a day over
[SPEAKER_04]: a thing, shaking flour and knocking off
the crystals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then carefully, you know, like
refining it, it doesn't get you enough
[SPEAKER_04]: weight for your time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: People we want to use machines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that changes it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And part of the reason why I think like
the tangy and the whole dimension that
[SPEAKER_04]: again, the tangy and the whole citrus
craze happened is because when like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, in mid 2000s, you couldn't give
away Calio.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you had citrus weed, that was a great
way for your broker to look at you and
[SPEAKER_04]: say, no dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not taking your weed, you know,
but then, and it was also citrus weed
[SPEAKER_04]: tends to not be that potent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, it's, you know, you could call
it, I don't want to say midsy,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you could say moderately potent at
best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the flavor people did blank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lacking recreational potency.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you start extracting it with BHO
or this or that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of a sudden that, that citrus
terpene came through super solid and now
[SPEAKER_04]: the shit's 70% THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it actually gets you high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a lot of the popular strains in
America that got made into hash got made
[SPEAKER_04]: into hash because after you put them
through the, the processes that we do to
[SPEAKER_04]: make life easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still tasted and worked good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but the, but the old like the
old static tech and the old, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the old sifting tech that was like
used forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't abandoned because it sucked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was abandoned because it was lower
yield and took a lot more time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and you know, most hash guys like to
make their money quick, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn it over.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to turn it over, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you get like, what you think is the
world's most amazing hash, the hash
[SPEAKER_04]: collectors in Europe don't think you're
smoking the world's most amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not that it's not good and
everybody can have their opinion,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just have a different perspective on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, more, man, it's hard to say,
but more cultured at some points when it
[SPEAKER_02]: comes to hash specifically.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's one of those things like,
like that's why you can compare it to
[SPEAKER_04]: wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like now in California,
you can have all these wine nerds that are
[SPEAKER_04]: extremely intelligent about the different
grapes and the different Appalachians and
[SPEAKER_04]: where certain varieties do better than
others because of climate.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the seventies, it was red and
white.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of where we are hashish
wise right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like anybody who's listening right
now, like, you know, who's made hash for
[SPEAKER_04]: the last 10 or 15 years, think about how
much your techniques and what you've been
[SPEAKER_04]: doing has been changing every year to this
whole time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like you've reached the
mountaintop, you know, it's like people
[SPEAKER_04]: figure out a way to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way to do it better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then people are like, oh shit,
I'm going to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of the traditional ash people
tell me that most of the modern cultivars
[SPEAKER_04]: that we grow with suck as far as hash
extraction where you get some,
[SPEAKER_04]: where you get some Lebanese shit or you
get some Nepalese stuff that for
[SPEAKER_04]: generations has been grown just for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that shit dumps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, cause that's what they designed
it to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when, when the hash revolution hit 10,
12 years ago, you know, people started
[SPEAKER_04]: looking around for all the elites that had
been kept around and do any of these also
[SPEAKER_04]: dump hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't bred for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one ever thought of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hash was like a, you know, hash was like a
personal product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you could get some Keef at a club.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you should get some water hash at a
club.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people would get scissor hash,
you know, if you were working or people
[SPEAKER_04]: would get finger hash when they were
bucking down stuff and all that,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it wasn't like commoditized.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever use an ISO two?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want, I want one of those to try out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If any of you guys out there have an ISO
two, I will trade you some seeds for one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I used to use my dad's is like a he
man castle along with my band group,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, castle gray skull and shit,
but I'd really like to see how it works
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: We could probably do a, we could probably
do a whole show on time on just the
[SPEAKER_04]: different eras of like, Oh, that sounds
cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm going to go on an octagon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm going to grow area ponics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm going to go NFT.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm going to grow this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm going to extract that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, coliseums.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Coliseums.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, dude, I had a color.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had two Coliseum.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we could go through all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just all like, whatever is the most
cutting edge shit imaginable.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember the V tables that were
like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone does popped up.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a pencil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's funny, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because a lot of my friends are
egotistical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or whatever, you know, but it's like the,
the main, you talk to hash people in
[SPEAKER_04]: California and the West coast now,
and they think they're the best hash
[SPEAKER_04]: people that have ever lived.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: That they dominate, you know, and I'm not
dissing them because they are figuring
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff out and they are making nice hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of them are failed growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also turning their back on
thousands of years of humans learning
[SPEAKER_04]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and, and it's, and it's like,
it's like when you're shocked when old
[SPEAKER_04]: people have something to teach you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's, there's, there's
techniques and there's things and there's
[SPEAKER_04]: aspects, you know, that, you know,
I mean, think about all those classes that
[SPEAKER_04]: Frenchie did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just teaching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who the fuck are you supposed to be?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and he was, and he, all he was
doing was just teaching some people how
[SPEAKER_04]: different cultures over there made some
hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and people ate it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they did.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and there's different flavor
profiles and there might be a way where
[SPEAKER_04]: you take a cultivar and you extract it one
way and it's potent, but it sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you do it another way and it's
amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not like all strains react the
same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like something, like I said, some things
go through water, like a champ.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I even did shit where I would have like a
greenhouse full of the same strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I would have outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like sometimes like the sour diesels
and certain things like that, if they got
[SPEAKER_04]: rained on a bunch in October, their
terpene profile wouldn't be exactly what I
[SPEAKER_04]: was after.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the sour diesel grown 30 feet away in
a greenhouse that never got rained on once
[SPEAKER_04]: was fed with the same food and the same
everything would be bomb.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but like the super silver haze
or certain citrus stuff, it wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: affected by the rain at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just kept its profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: But sometimes the rain, enough rain would
fuck up the flavor on my weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and well, you know, someone just
said it's potent, but it sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the biggest oxymoron ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends because it depends on how it
depends on how you what the high is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can quality of high.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can read old high times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not to bring up high times,
but a lot of people's opinion of the old
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghani one was that it was uncomfortable,
anxiety inducing body high that gave you
[SPEAKER_04]: heart palpitations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was one of the least enjoyable
smokes out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they way preferred sativas or normal
or NLs or there was lots of other highs
[SPEAKER_04]: that they liked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They thought it was potent, but they
didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some people like some some
people the that sativa buzz that NL five
[SPEAKER_04]: haze buzz or that Neville's haze buzz.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super potent and it makes them want
to crawl out of their skin and jump off a
[SPEAKER_04]: bridge and die.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'd never smoke it again if,
you know, they hate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like me with skunk one types.
[SPEAKER_04]: They fucking hate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super potent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the nicest sativa I've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's people that are smoking a
couple of times and they'll be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's a bad time for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, potency is just one aspect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just means it's strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't mean that it's going to affect
you in a pleasant way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I personally I don't like
edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't control the high.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just strapped in because and the
reason why I don't like edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be perfectly honest is that they fuck
with my equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_04]: They give me this like, you know,
when you're drunk and you're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: if I put a foot on the ground,
I'll stop the spins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can give me the spins.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not like that feeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have friends that will be like,
oh, you just got to eat enough and blow
[SPEAKER_04]: past it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me, I'm like, well, how how many
hours of uncomfortable do I have to feel
[SPEAKER_04]: before I start feeling good?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't feel good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like weed a whole bunch and I don't feel
good at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so how many hours of my life do
I want to not feel good?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that happens to me enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so I don't do edibles because
like I got kids and shit, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, one of my kids could break
their toe or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter how much weed I've
smoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hop in the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can take them to the hospital.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do whatever I need to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I just ate a couple hundred
milligrams of edibles, I might need to
[SPEAKER_04]: like call a lifeline, you know,
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, yeah, I have all kinds of people
are going to start commenting,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, you just need to take these.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just need to eat these.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying that for me, the way my
body works, sometimes it gives me the
[SPEAKER_04]: spins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't like the spins.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people don't understand
that, though, how variable everybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: brain chemistry is and how each individual
cannabinoid or what have you interacts
[SPEAKER_02]: differently with everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody gets the same effect from
the same clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Though, you know, I mean, collectives,
that's the way people are tied.
[SPEAKER_02]: All indicus do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: All sativus do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: All hybrids do right in the middle,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Chem 91 is one of my all time
favorite highs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me feel like I'm a teenager
watching a Mel Brooks movie and I got a
[SPEAKER_04]: big thing of popcorn and I'm happy and
content and life is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have good friends that are like
meh.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I love what it I love what it what
it breeds like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand that a lot of other
people like it, but I wouldn't like to
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke it on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so there's that aspect,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and that's that's one of the
main things that all the hash guys that
[SPEAKER_04]: experience tell me is that they can't they
just simply can't find the same effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you tried suppositories, buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you tried any of those?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I can assist you if you need help.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you've got you've got although you
got all those extra jumbo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that extra long attachment on the
thing to get extra long release.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, yeah, I don't I don't need any of that
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm sure that for people that have
a hard time and a bunch of nausea,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I'm not trying to make foot off
fun off it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be the best way for them to
absorb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got a pretty funny pretty funny
story about boofing stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a friend named Brian.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's dead now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he had heard that if you boof
Oxycontin granted that we were like 1718,
[SPEAKER_02]: you heard that if you boof Oxycontin,
you get really fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the early days of Oxycontin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he stuck the Oxycontin up his ass and
waited and waited.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he realized that there's a
coating on the outside that it really
[SPEAKER_02]: won't penetrate through your asshole.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he had to crush it up and reinsert it
into his ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my boofing story.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do joke with my friends that are younger
than me, you know, that their contribution
[SPEAKER_04]: to drug culture is boofing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it really is that really that's what
they that's what they're going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: remembered for.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's their innovation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, all that different types
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, whatever it like I have seen
people making suppositories for very sick
[SPEAKER_04]: cancer patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And AIDS patients and other various
aspects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure that they do a great job.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what people also should know,
too, is that when you eat when you eat
[SPEAKER_04]: weed, or you take it, you know,
suppository style, it turns into THC 11.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, did you know that?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It converts into something when you smoke
it, it's it's Delta 11 THC, Delta 11.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's much longer lasting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and so that's kind of why you
get fucked, like in the sense of like,
[SPEAKER_04]: if it if it hits you the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're sort of stuck with that
feeling for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so me and Delta nine are real good
friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Delta nine and me, we get along,
we see we see eye to eye on things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can smoke whatever format even you know,
I don't I'm more of a flower person than
[SPEAKER_04]: hash, but I can smoke a bunch of hash and
I can still accomplish whatever I need to
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: 11 hydroxy not Delta.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 11.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I misspoke but but yeah,
it converts in your gut into something
[SPEAKER_04]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's longer lasting and it has a some
different effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, doesn't it bind with your fat
cells too, which makes it more potent in
[SPEAKER_04]: your stomach.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're getting into into areas I'm not
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's one of those things where I
don't care about edibles that much because
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't I don't I don't use them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not that important to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I I do think that they're a
great way for some people to get medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, but I got shit to do and I
got kids and I can't take myself out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a good way to take yourself
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, to be honest, like in the
90s and stuff like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: now you can go to the you can go to the
store, you can be like, oh, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_04]: get a five milligram or a 10 milligram or
50 or 100 milligram, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And back in the day, you know,
and you know, when I was doing edibles
[SPEAKER_04]: more, it was like, is this ganja goo ball?
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I going to feel anything?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the way up to I'm in my tent and I
can't move.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm missing the festival because I'm
horizontal.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here just came here just answered.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, no, it crosses the blood brain
barrier more easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It converts in the liver, not the gut,
which totally makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew I was going to I knew I was going
to misspeak.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew that it affected you differently
and it converted differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was nervous to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to talk about the various science
of it because I wasn't I probably wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: going to get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I'm very adventuresome and I'll talk
about the science of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, exactly nothing what I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm good at that part.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just knew that it converted differently
and it and it and it lasted longer and it
[SPEAKER_04]: has a different series of effects than
inhale and then smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know someone said that people with
diabetes can't feel edibles and I can
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely disprove that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm diabetic and I can feel
edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've been on, you know,
I've eaten some ganja goo balls at times
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I definitely I'm not I'm speaking from
experience when I was like, I'm in the
[SPEAKER_04]: tent and I can't move.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't stand up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to pee.
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I going to pee myself?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I move?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's the good shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, it's just like it's
just bad dosing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: These six ganja goo balls are almost
worthless and you wasted your money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this one is like catatonic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, do you really want to be
catatonic at a festival?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how you get raped.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happens to me every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, I mean, not that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, but but it's just yeah,
you paid money to be there and now you're
[SPEAKER_04]: laying on rocks in a tent spinning,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just one of those things where
it's like, you know, and actually,
[SPEAKER_04]: too, it's like it's interesting in the
sense that I don't even know if I should
[SPEAKER_04]: bring this up, but I have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a daughter that I have a couple of
daughters in middle school.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's one of their big issues right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is edibles.
Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's taking edibles to school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're easy to to mask.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need an older brother, an older sister
or someone that's willing to go and buy
[SPEAKER_04]: them and kick them down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're sour patch kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're made in a bunch of attractive
ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, like when we were kids, the only way
you got edibles is if some degenerate
[SPEAKER_04]: older brother made some brownies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Off some shake or something like that and
was able to stink up their whole house or
[SPEAKER_04]: some shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they can get like these really
attractive, much more controllable
[SPEAKER_04]: packages.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to get caught with a
lighter or a pipe or stinking like weed or
[SPEAKER_04]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just eat like a 10 milligram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're a lot more prevalent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nerds ropes, sour patch kids, Rice Krispie
treats, all kinds of there's an immense
[SPEAKER_04]: amount of baking and candy and shit and
much more controllable amounts that I just
[SPEAKER_04]: don't like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not what you're saying is kids are
good customers.
[SPEAKER_04]: None.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I just mean that kids are going
to get access to whatever is cool that's
[SPEAKER_04]: available in their local area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's easy to smuggle in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I remember back in high school,
they would do like locker raids and all
[SPEAKER_02]: kinds of shit, trying to catch us dealing
drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't have things like,
you know, gummy bears and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you took out some of those gummy bears,
if you took out some sour patch kids from
[SPEAKER_04]: from an edible thing you got and you put
them in a real sour patch kids thing and
[SPEAKER_04]: took them in your lunchbox or your thing
or backpack, how would they fucking know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're invisible at that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, so I just I just I just
don't like edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't like edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we kind of got off.
[SPEAKER_04]: We kind of got off track there or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like a big thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some people are into them,
but they steal.
[SPEAKER_04]: They steal my they steal my equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they steal other people's
equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I start not feeling the right way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I get hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you get hot and you have the
spins, I mean, how fun is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you end up puking.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not fun for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I think it'll probably take
like it would probably take like
[SPEAKER_04]: international freedom, where weed really
becomes opened up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For Americans over here, at least to
really start trying like the finest grades
[SPEAKER_04]: of imported hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't see I see the the world
opening up and it being so super corporate
[SPEAKER_02]: and hyper illegal that nobody's going to
be fucking with shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's going to be in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll have those small clubs and all
that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be just that culture infiltrating
everywhere as opposed to letting the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultures that are there stay there,
being able to try each other's cultures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's money to be made off this shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, right now, you know,
you can get you can get Greek olive oil,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you can get those Iberian hams
that cost eighteen hundred dollars for the
[SPEAKER_04]: leg that have been dry aged XML.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what you can't get?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what you can't get?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thailand races anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very, very hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things are disappearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just the not just the strains,
but the cultures are disappearing with
[SPEAKER_02]: them in some senses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And granted, that's not a hash culture
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it just like just like those strains
disappearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's you know, the techniques are
going to be going with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, people are saying people are
talking about people paying more for six
[SPEAKER_04]: star or whatever else.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's an aspect where, you know,
there's obviously different grades.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But no matter how pure you make it,
you're still limited by your starting
[SPEAKER_04]: material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you all getting it from a single
source?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it all the same cultivar?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is all the same cut?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you getting it from a field?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you getting it from you planted
thousands of seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're harvesting those females?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, there's an aspect there
where, you know, because you're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: hash is concentrated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where you're going to concentrate what was
in the flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to concentrate the qualities
of that of that THC or that blend or that
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD, CBN, terpene profile, all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do they call it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so you just you're going to get
a vastly different experience,
[SPEAKER_04]: probably from Moroccan, from Lebanese,
to Afghanistan, to Southeast Asian,
[SPEAKER_04]: to sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a lot of times, too, people
people still like even hash makers right
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh, my God, this is
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: The terpenes off it are amazing,
but it yielded two percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So fuck it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: People want hash dumpers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to it's got to be commercially
viable first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or it won't get beyond some small little
circle.
[SPEAKER_04]: There might be there might be a few
friends that like wash it and they're all
[SPEAKER_04]: trading grams amongst each other and all
stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it won't trickle down to where the
normal person can get it because it wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: a viable amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not a hash guy that that big or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do know from working in legal
cannabis and stuff like that, that there's
[SPEAKER_04]: minimum numbers of weight return that you
need to get to make it be viable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: To pay for your time, to pay for the
equipment, to pay for the shift work and
[SPEAKER_04]: all the stuff that goes into making hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it doesn't dump enough, regardless
of how nice it affects you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to get it's going to get
shifted to the side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you've got something that that
blows your head off, but it yields three
[SPEAKER_04]: and a half percent and it's sister plant
tastes a little bit different and doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: work as good, but yields six percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Six percent is getting run.
[SPEAKER_04]: And washed all day.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's making a money.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so, you know, so there's that,
too, where it's like the commercial side
[SPEAKER_04]: of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: People might think, oh, we have the best
hash in the world, but unless it's
[SPEAKER_04]: commercially viable, you'll probably never
see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're growing it, washing it and
making it yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or in your small circle of friends and
trading it amongst each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, you know, just like before,
like if you were growing a 12 or 13 or 14
[SPEAKER_04]: week plant, you'd probably never be able
to buy that in a store.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I wouldn't think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: GMO is probably the first thing that came
out that took 12 weeks that people were
[SPEAKER_04]: willing to jump on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That always shocked me, especially coming
from the cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, part of the reason, part of the
reason why I think people were willing to
[SPEAKER_04]: jump on it was because even though it took
two weeks, four weeks longer than they
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted or three weeks longer than they
wanted, it dumped like crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it tested super high.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it smelled like Chem D and Chem D was
not everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the yield made it worth it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where if the yield doesn't make the extra
time worth it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Matt and I joke that like,
I mean, there's some pretty famous
[SPEAKER_04]: breeders out there that are like,
if it takes any longer than 63 days,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I'm harvesting it early.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got this banger Colombian and it
takes 11 weeks, but I don't take it longer
[SPEAKER_04]: than 63 days because it doesn't fit my
model.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of how that rolls.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The American way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's just, there's a difference
between quality and commercial.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I mean too about like,
for instance, the wine industry is now
[SPEAKER_04]: there's enough education in the wine
industry that a certain seven or eight
[SPEAKER_04]: year old cabernet from a certain winery in
a certain region, you can get that extra
[SPEAKER_04]: ducats to make that a viable product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, cannabis doesn't have enough of
that separation to make the rare and the
[SPEAKER_04]: cool and the expensive worth it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all, there's like this range that
everybody's working in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we haven't gotten educated enough that
you could be like, you should pay more for
[SPEAKER_04]: this weed because it's Neville's Hayes and
it takes 15 weeks and you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it does this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually you'll have people that are
willing to throw down for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now you don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now it's just, you don't,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so until you get that level of
education, until you get that consumer
[SPEAKER_04]: willing to pay for it, I honestly think
like the reason why people are going to
[SPEAKER_04]: yell at me for this, but I think the
reason why freaking Hayes did so well in
[SPEAKER_04]: New York, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was because there was musicians and rich
people and Wall Street brokers to sell it
[SPEAKER_04]: to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could sell them a higher grade.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Straight up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, do you think Kush would have been
so popular in LA if it wasn't 7,200 a
[SPEAKER_04]: pound wholesale?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, never.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an aspect of it where,
where it became massive because in LA it
[SPEAKER_04]: was like, Oh, this is expensive and
exclusive and it's not in your bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then people wanted what the,
what, what people had it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people were willing to pay a shit ton
for it, but we really haven't gotten there
[SPEAKER_04]: with weed yet too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's individual things that break
through here and there, but we really
[SPEAKER_04]: haven't gotten the criteria as to like why
this weed or why this hash is nicer and
[SPEAKER_04]: should be more expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, I mean, I, I even saw there
was, there was some shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, I see that, uh,
you know, uh, Chimera is on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was talking earlier this week about
he's got RKS that he doesn't want to
[SPEAKER_04]: release because it's got unique traits in
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That he wants to utilize later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he doesn't think the market's ready
for it, whatever those traits might be,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that could be, that could be true too.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of times the market isn't
ready for anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always been very good at being,
um, at the forefront of stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely making no sales, being at the
forefront of stuff and watching others
[SPEAKER_02]: come and clean up with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just about hitting it at the right
time when the market's ready for
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we talked about that before too,
like all that super dog work that me and
[SPEAKER_04]: my, and my homie did, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that was like years before American
seed sellers could really get a toehold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had no place for it to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we had no place for it to go,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, uh, you know, it's, it's gotta be
the right, it's gotta, there's gotta be a
[SPEAKER_04]: balance between commercially viable and
fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has to match, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know, right now it's like we've
been in, we went to war with Afghanistan
[SPEAKER_04]: for 20 years, so it's probably not the,
uh, um, it's probably not the best time to
[SPEAKER_04]: go over there as a white guy and,
uh, start looking around for hashish and,
[SPEAKER_04]: and rare things like that, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get Taliban or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but, you know, but, uh, um,
but they actually have a real culture over
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a real vibrant hashish culture
and it's just separated from us.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always a trip to me with,
with how, how, um, religiously
[SPEAKER_02]: conservative those areas are, but there
still is a breeding culture or a weed
[SPEAKER_02]: culture there, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is so counter to the Muslim culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, you know, it's like, I think it's
one of those things where it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, it, it predated, you know,
predated, uh, that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it's, it's, well, it's just
kind of like how, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, there's any number of different
things where, like, Christianity just
[SPEAKER_04]: absorbed certain pagan rituals into
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they, because they couldn't get
rid of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they co-opted it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want to bring, you want to bring
Allah to Afghanistan, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_04]: to incorporate some hashish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's ancient there and they ain't
getting rid of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should have done that with Christians.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, better here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, well, you know, they, I mean,
they, it, it just, it just didn't,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's probably an anomaly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It probably is.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like it's an accident,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and you know, they probably didn't
realize how much effect they were going to
[SPEAKER_04]: have a thousand years later or 2000 years
later.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, and that regard, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so, but yeah, I mean, hash,
you know, the, the hash in America is
[SPEAKER_04]: moving along really quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and I wish I could go back to,
to, um, maybe I will sometime and go back
[SPEAKER_04]: and, um, and talk in Holland and stuff
like that and see what, what they have
[SPEAKER_04]: right now is their best stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be interesting to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just how it affects you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that's what they all talk about is
the, the flavor and the effect is just un,
[SPEAKER_04]: un, you just can't, you just can't get it
in other shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be the judge of that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, and they also, even back when I was
going back there a bunch, it was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: they would grab, you know, like,
you know, a certain amount of kilos would
[SPEAKER_04]: hit Amsterdam and it would all get bought
up by collectors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they all sit on it and hope that
they didn't run out before they found
[SPEAKER_04]: something else of that quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they'd have a chunk of this and a
chunk of this and a chunk of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, so on and so forth and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what, you know, they,
they'd smoke, they'd smoke, they'd,
[SPEAKER_04]: they'd almost keep flour for the
Americans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they'd show you, and then they'd
show you what they really were,
[SPEAKER_04]: were into.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: In that regard, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, and so, you know,
we're, we, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, maybe there's a, there's an aspect
of America where we blend, we blended a
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch of the smoking weed with a bunch of
the hashish weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of create, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, we took stuff that was
bred for smoking, like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Columbia and, and Mexican and things of
that nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we blended it with all this stuff
that was specifically designed for
[SPEAKER_04]: hashish.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like all the Afghans that came over
originally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was all bred exclusively for,
they didn't, they weren't going for like,
[SPEAKER_04]: does this flour taste good?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They never tasted the flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They hashed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the hash had to taste, have a taste of
its own.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it's different.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's different when you're burning aged
hash versus, versus like a bunch of flour
[SPEAKER_04]: material.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we started figuring all that out
and we started blending it with sativas
[SPEAKER_04]: and blending it with different things and
trying to see how they all came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's weird in the sense that
like America and Holland sort of became
[SPEAKER_04]: the two places, I should say Canada too,
North America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of became where like all the various
regions of weed started blending.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could probably put Australia in that
category.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like, it sounds like,
I don't have a lot of familiarity with
[SPEAKER_04]: over there, but like, it sounds like
Australia was another melting pot where
[SPEAKER_04]: they got a bunch of Southeast Asian weed
and they got a bunch of, they got a bunch
[SPEAKER_04]: of Indian and Afghanistan and Pakistan and
blends of different stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, it, and there was people
too, maybe we could switch, we could
[SPEAKER_04]: switch bases for a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was people that were asking,
which is more Matt's world than mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can let him talk for a minute about what
the, what the internet, what the seed
[SPEAKER_04]: market is like outside of us, like outside
of our like little STS reversals,
[SPEAKER_04]: like what everyone's familiar with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this guy's dropping caps, dropping
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt's dropping something.
[SPEAKER_04]: CSI has a drop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here comes these people.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, cause we're used to like very
small scale, you know, like, and I think
[SPEAKER_04]: probably most people think of the last 10
years as what's normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not, I would think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not really what's out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, but you know, obviously like,
so maybe you could talk for a minute about
[SPEAKER_04]: like, what, what is it like out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean like, so like someone like my
mirror that's been around before me,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's going to have a different experience
than when I entered.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I entered in, you had, you had to
fuck with Europeans or your seeds weren't
[SPEAKER_02]: going to sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you weren't fucking with
European seed bank and we're trying to do
[SPEAKER_02]: direct, you had a very, very small chance
of getting any meaningful sales because
[SPEAKER_02]: people wanted to buy from seed banks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seed banks were known.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't a lot of places to do
exchanges.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could always, you know, do it,
get down in the DMS on different forums
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was, that was really not cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it wasn't looked at as a cool thing
to do by the, the forum bonus because they
[SPEAKER_02]: were, they were kind of taking some risk
for your exchange, even though it was done
[SPEAKER_02]: in the DMS is still on their server and
transaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wasn't looked upon positively by a
lot of the, the, the forum owners for
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody to be doing any exchanges of any
sorts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually you'd get banned from places
for doing anything of the sort.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were, we were mostly counting on
when I entered in, it had just started the
[SPEAKER_02]: British and attitude wasn't a thing when I
first started.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, most of it was outside of the U
S I think having stairway was,
[SPEAKER_02]: was that Canada or the U S I think,
uh, Canada, I think it was Canada,
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was a Canada where Calrissian
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean he had the Canadian seed banks.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them wouldn't pick up American
folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember, um, med user Chris over,
over at wood horse seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was really not friendly to most
Americans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, depot was around, but you still had a
hard time getting them to pick up most
[SPEAKER_02]: Americans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So being an American, you had the choice,
mostly a British or if you were lucky,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a Dutch seed bank would pick you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's, it was minimal.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it, like when, when I got booted
off the attitude, sub cool had asked,
[SPEAKER_02]: it basically gave that given them a
ultimatum, me or him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the time there was just me and him
that were the Americans on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I left the attitude, and,
uh, on some unceremoniously left,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, I had to figure out what was I going
to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to take the risk, be the one
American trying to sell direct or was I
[SPEAKER_02]: going to just find another seed bank and
get fucked?
[SPEAKER_02]: So first thing I did was try to operate a
seed bank with a few other Americans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately chose the brothel
brothers who were notorious scammers and
[SPEAKER_02]: they got me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually I just learned,
fuck, I got to do this myself or it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there, you know, I mean,
you could be operating great in the U S
[SPEAKER_02]: but if you weren't taking credit cards
like the Europeans, then you just weren't
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be any sort of competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those were always going to get the,
the sales nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot different nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all sorts of direct buying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Instagram kind of changed a lot,
you know, Instagram made everyone a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: more accessible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, seeds were a lot easier to sell
because people weren't as interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were more interested in learning,
uh, by looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, oh, that's pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: That look, that looks dank became a real
catchphrase during Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, that looks dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, back in the day, we kind of
knew that looks didn't mean anything when
[SPEAKER_02]: it came to darkness.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the weird thing, let me interject
for a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I'm seeing stuff in the comments is
that America was an enormous seed market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But everyone that tried to deal with
America typically got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everyone in Europe, you know,
when they saw what happened in Neville,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, the super sativa seed club just shut
down and a lot of, you know, seed banks
[SPEAKER_04]: became very hesitant to ship stuff to
America.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Canadian seed banks sort of took
over that, that role for a minute and
[SPEAKER_04]: started being willing to ship stuff to
America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and a lot of times they sort of like
took the reins from Europe because Europe
[SPEAKER_04]: would send it to Canada, you know,
and it would get, and it would get
[SPEAKER_04]: filtered through.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as, as, uh, you know, Camaro was
mentioning a few minutes ago, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: heaven's stairway went down because there
was an intercepted shipment to the United
[SPEAKER_04]: States and that got cannabis world and
overgrow shut down at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And well, and we, we're going to do a full
episode on this, me and flan, but it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to go into detail on,
um, Silpro, heaven's stairway,
[SPEAKER_02]: overgrow, ICMAG, and how they were all
related in the big bust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is over a period of several
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's the people are still being
prosecuted.
[SPEAKER_02]: From one major fuck up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why I used to go to Amsterdam to buy seed
in the nineties was because that was the
[SPEAKER_04]: most reliable way to get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, getting it shipped over was very
difficult, you know, and a lot of people
[SPEAKER_04]: wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Mark Emory who had, you know,
cannabis culture magazine, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had his whole seed company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, he ended up doing, I don't know,
five ish years or something like that in
[SPEAKER_04]: America in prison for seed sales.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so there was a big issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: With America's this voracious seed market,
but how do you get seeds there without
[SPEAKER_04]: getting in trouble?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, there wasn't,
you know, people on IG now you can see all
[SPEAKER_04]: these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I was joking about,
you know, Oh, this guy's got a drop
[SPEAKER_04]: coming, you know, when 20 years ago or
whatever, when I was doing a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: reading work, um, there was no outlet to
get that to anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no way to advertise it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no way to set up shipping.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no way to, I mean, even like
somebody like DJ short who, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: ended up working with a bunch of
Canadians.
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of the reason why he worked with so
many people was that in order for his
[SPEAKER_04]: sweet, his stuff to get out there,
he had to work with Tony from sag Martha
[SPEAKER_04]: first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he ended up working with the
Dutch passion crew.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hank and Dutch passion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he ended up not liking that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he ended up working with various
people up in Canada, but he had to work
[SPEAKER_04]: with third parties because there was no
way for him.
[SPEAKER_04]: To safely distribute, advertise and
communicate with people from America to
[SPEAKER_04]: get seeds out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it really wasn't until social media
exploded and IG exploded and proposition
[SPEAKER_04]: to 15 and medical started spreading enough
that it started calming down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For all these seed companies, like,
you know, think about all the popular,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, uh, cap or, or, you know,
swamp boys or these people, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: cookie, anybody, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All these people came up and their
possibilities started in the social media,
IG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what Matt's talking about is how
difficult it was as an American seed
[SPEAKER_04]: breeder to even find a home that could,
that could be a middleman that could get,
[SPEAKER_04]: that could get your seeds out to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, my buddy that, uh,
that I, he doesn't like to be mentioned,
[SPEAKER_04]: but my buddy, I call Staten Island,
he kept talking about like the potential
[SPEAKER_04]: for seeds and I was totally dismissive.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were both right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the time I was right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he saw 10 or 15 years down the road,
what was coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, he saw it, but it just wasn't there
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember making that, that shift from,
um, cash propping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a very, very clear memory for
me when I had to make that choice of fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can cash crop or I can make seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot do both, you know, and having to
make something that I know, I know I can
[SPEAKER_02]: make enough money to survive growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what I love to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that way that did, that slowly
was not my passion anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: My passion was making seeds and,
and learning what I could create,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what could be created in these
rooms and, uh, having to make that
[SPEAKER_02]: decision to only go to seed was a tough
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause at the time they, it was very risky.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't a lot of money in seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, granted greenhouse is killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: DNA was killing it, but Americans just
weren't killing it at that level yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, DNA, we can talk about DNA for a
second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are two Americans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plumber in the stunt cop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they, you know, they, they went to
Humboldt and Mendo and all these different
[SPEAKER_04]: places and they gathered up a bunch of
seed and a bunch of clones from various
[SPEAKER_04]: friends, but they had to go to Holland to
make a seed company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no, there was no, in the early
two thousands, there was no way they were
[SPEAKER_04]: going to do an American based seed
company.
[SPEAKER_04]: How would they even get ahold of you?
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you get ahold of them?
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you not get busted?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was, uh, it, it wasn't,
it wasn't very easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we basically worked first through
Holland and that's kind of why Holland
[SPEAKER_04]: became the epicenter was it allowed it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Neville got lucky because he had balls.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a bunch of American breeders were
fleeing prosecution in America and
[SPEAKER_04]: bringing him stuff.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, he got stuff from,
from Greg and he got stuff from Sam
[SPEAKER_04]: Skunkman and he got, and he got stuff
through Mel Frank and Jorge Cervantes and
[SPEAKER_04]: he got stuff from Jim Ortega, all these
people, you know, because that was the
[SPEAKER_04]: place that it could go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when Canada became the place it
could go, that's where it all went.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when California and Oregon and
Washington started being the place that it
[SPEAKER_04]: could go, that's where it went.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really sucks because there's this
artificial line between America and Canada
[SPEAKER_04]: that sort of kept our two cultures.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's made it a lot more difficult to,
huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to lie between 2007 and
2010.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that it was such a small market,
it was fucking killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't have all kinds of competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the best competition I had was
like swerve and sub at the time and
[SPEAKER_02]: rascal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for Americans and rascal was,
he was at the top of the food chain when
[SPEAKER_02]: it came to reversals.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, sub and swerve, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean, there's, there's, there's an
aspect of it, but it's like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, people think that like people
don't realize how long it took to get to,
[SPEAKER_04]: to get democracy where some guy in a
garage could have a 15 lighter or two or
[SPEAKER_04]: three, four lighters or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And make some breeding and do a drop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And advertise the drop and let,
uh, and, and let everyone know that they
[SPEAKER_04]: was coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was just thinking about
something as far as drops go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I remember when that was looked at
very negatively.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to do a drop, meaning can
hit one male to more than five or six
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, you were a shitty Paul and
Chucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was like a mark of shame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like drops were not a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that's the common accepted way.
[SPEAKER_02]: This clone or this male crossed a X amount
of clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the accepted way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But back in the day, that was not,
you were not looked at favorably.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not looking down on anyone for
doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was one of the people looked down on not
favorably for doing those.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we talked about it before,
but you know, 12 or 14 years ago,
[SPEAKER_04]: the four or five guys, uh, doing reversals
were looked upon as cheating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cheating.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're ruining the fucking, you are
ruining genetics for good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're ruining the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're eliminating males.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're taking shortcuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're doing this fucked up thing that
shouldn't be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're trying to do shortcuts to make a
quick buck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and it went from that and it was,
you know, I don't know, uh, Emory is a
[SPEAKER_04]: douche bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most people agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a cunt that he is a, he is a not,
he is not a nice person, um, by any means.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, I mean, but you know,
there's a, there's a lot of people that,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, you know, you get to know them in weed
and you're like, Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's not a good kisser.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, but there's an aspect where it's
like, like we've talked about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, it was Matt and rascal and Hybe
and, uh, a couple other, a couple other
[SPEAKER_04]: people doing reversals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a sea of, of male female
breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now fast forward 12 years and it's
completely reversed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like 98% fems and 2% of people doing
reg breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's rare to see people do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a reg seed line drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what's really weird too,
for me, like I, I don't do that many,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, fem seed runs anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't, even though I sell the
spray and I've been doing it a long time,
[SPEAKER_02]: people associate me with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do them often.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do them very often at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I prefer regular seed breeding because
it's so much easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a fucking free pass to not fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah, it's, it's, it's a totally
different than people's, uh, ideas of what
[SPEAKER_02]: fem breeding is and how easy it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, uh, regular breeding is easy in the
sense of getting actual successful
[SPEAKER_04]: pollination with real, with real,
not, not that you're going to achieve your
[SPEAKER_04]: goals.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's still the breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's still a lot of, that's still a lot
of dead ends and failure in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sure, you know, and all that,
but, but, you know, feminized breeding,
[SPEAKER_04]: even, even getting pollen and getting
viable pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, uh, it's a crap shoe.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are saying, don't you think the
market's telling breeders what they want?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't necessarily, I don't think
that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that finding males is a bunch of
work and people started doing things where
[SPEAKER_04]: you can't get either one of these two
elite cuttings, but I'll give you a hybrid
[SPEAKER_04]: of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't get TK by Skittles.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you can't get either cut,
but you can buy a hybrid from me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's what started it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think honestly, it's like people buy
what's available.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, uh, you know, reversals just,
you just took an elite cut and you crossed
[SPEAKER_04]: it to another elite.
[SPEAKER_04]: You took an elite cut and you threw that
on 15 or 20 other cuts and boom,
[SPEAKER_04]: you've got a seed drop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And reversals actually really killed the,
the line breeding, you know, companies
[SPEAKER_04]: used to, we were going to talk about Simon
today, tonight, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk about Sirius a little
bit or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Sirius seeds, they offered the same
six lines for like, it fucking 15 years,
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 years, you know, uh, since he seed
bank, you know, uh, when Neville was there
[SPEAKER_04]: or whatever, probably Matt and I were
looking at a bunch of the catalogs.
[SPEAKER_04]: They barely offered a new line for five or
six years.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the same ass shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the late nineties,
they added two or three more lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, back in the day, they expected you to
work on your line and refine it hopefully.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you had those flagship strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make those lines better over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's literally like, I did this
reversal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got X amount of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're here until they're gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably won't make them again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave it a name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't, you can't hit up, you know,
um, you could hit up serious seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: throughout the nineties and you could get
AK 47 and you could get white Russian and
[SPEAKER_04]: you could get chronic and you could get
bubble gum and you could get, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just on, it was just available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me, let me use this point actually
to tell a story and you'll like this story
[SPEAKER_02]: because it, it has something to do with
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I gave not so some seeds a while back
and I was pretty sure I remembered what I
[SPEAKER_02]: gave him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I thought I gave him an old pack of AK
47 and I was like, man, when's he going to
[SPEAKER_02]: pop those motherfuckers?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would bust his balls over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, man, where's those AK 47 get a five.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I don't know what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like fucking not so right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bought it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bust his balls for at least a year and a
half, two years, every time I lost his
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking ancient seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the old seed guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I talk up AK like crazy, all this
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: He sends them to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only do I not do anything with them,
but I fuck him over by like not actually
[SPEAKER_04]: cracking them or like, I just fucking
ignored him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I lost them and I keep telling
them, I don't have them over and over and
[SPEAKER_04]: over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, dude, I gave you these
fucking seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, I was busting his balls about
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, probably, I don't know,
a month ago.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I hadn't talked to you for a
long time, skunk tech hits him up and is
[SPEAKER_02]: like, Hey, you know, I haven't talked to
Matt, but let him know that I have to
[SPEAKER_02]: those AK 47 seeds he gave me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Oh, happy too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I called Matt up and I was like,
you're a dick dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: You gave them to someone else and fucked
me and told me that I fucking lost them
[SPEAKER_04]: and I didn't remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm a stoner and fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you sent, I sent, I mean rare
shit from the nineties and I blew it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in fairness, he still does have super
skunk and nevels haze over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, there's a, there's a,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in fairness to me, uh,
before 2017, there wasn't like biblical
[SPEAKER_04]: fires every year in my area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind the fires at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that, that ruined a number of seed
crops for me and gave me kind of some PTSD
[SPEAKER_03]: and all that will do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, going back to going back
to Simon, I mean, can you imagine?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you know, whoever, you know,
for the last five years, the swamp boys
[SPEAKER_04]: have offered the same six lines.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt's offered the same six lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Caleb CSI has offered the same 20 and they
just remake them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what people are doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get, you're expected to work on
all those lines and improve them,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you can because you're only offering
half a dozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now every seed drop is like fucking 20
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least usually.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and they're all given a name and
they're all given packaging and they're
[SPEAKER_04]: all given this and they're all sold and
that's that, that's that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're likely never see them again
because the person's not going to remake
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, the person, the fucking,
the person isn't even usually growing them
[SPEAKER_04]: out anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I will say just, just to
finish the story, I will give skunk techs
[SPEAKER_02]: a major props.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't even have to tell me that he had
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't have to tell me that he did
selections and made more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he certainly didn't have to tell not
so to make sure I get them, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: or make sure I know about them to get
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So props to him for doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, that was, that was pretty
fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are AK 47 NF2 somewhere and
they're based on the cherry stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's cool too.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's sad about it is that in 1999,
they changed the laws in Holland in
[SPEAKER_04]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I should say the Netherlands really,
cause only two provinces are are Holland,
[SPEAKER_04]: but in the Netherlands, they changed the
seed laws where before seed making was
[SPEAKER_04]: legal and they changed it to being
illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of the big producers in,
in the Netherlands got busted within a
[SPEAKER_04]: year or two of that change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of seed strains and a lot of
wines that were available throughout the
[SPEAKER_04]: nineties then changed because parents were
lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Being Dutch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not trying to be racist is the
wrong word.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or whatever, but just culturally the Dutch
are businessmen and they won't admit that
[SPEAKER_04]: they lost anything ever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you ask Ben or Alan drunkers,
they'll tell you where they have all the
[SPEAKER_04]: same breeding parents that they've had
since the nineties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we know that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it apparently Simon admitted that he
lost a couple of breeding parents in his
[SPEAKER_04]: raid and Kali missed and AK 47 were not
the same after.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should also, it should also be said,
and this is super fucking annoying for me,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But that Neville and S super sativa seed
club kind of came first, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So they just told you where they were,
what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't have competition, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So Neville was like, Oh, I got this NL
from this person and I got this from this
[SPEAKER_04]: to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I crossed them and I called it NL by
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and he gave you a whole bunch of
information on lineage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can go through, we've done it
before, but you can go through and most of
[SPEAKER_04]: where Neville got his stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know the name of the person that gave
it to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know where he got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know if he got it as a seed line or if
he got it as a cutting, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We know all that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Simon and Simon was really nice to
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't fucking know what's in AK 47.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know exactly what's in Kali
missed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been hunting for 25, 30 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the lineage on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all the second wave of breeders,
uh, that came out, uh, sag Martha,
[SPEAKER_04]: Syria seeds, th seeds, Dutch passion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know, uh, um, what's his name?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Luke from paradise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's in Sensi star.
[SPEAKER_04]: God only knows what's in what they all
started hiding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They, they hid where they got it from,
who they got it from, what the mix was in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it started this massive guessing
game.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of I love AK 47.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea what's in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love for Simon to one day be like,
I'm old and I'm just down to just say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I, one thing I will say, that's also
interesting is from that old pack of
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe they were sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simon said, according to the number on it,
they were sold in 2000, which meant they
[SPEAKER_02]: could have been made in 98, 99.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was interesting was that the cherry,
you know, was supposedly popping up.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would he say?
[SPEAKER_02]: One in 500 or one?
[SPEAKER_02]: A thousand something a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took a lot to find it in the three
seeds that popped out of 10 from this old
[SPEAKER_02]: pack, two were cherry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wonder if there's some sort of like
Viking in it, um, which was a very cherry
[SPEAKER_02]: line floating around Amsterdam at the time
that a lot of people are using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but that's the first thing that,
that makes me think that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could, you're, you know, that,
uh, something that I didn't know that it
[SPEAKER_04]: wasn't lost in the bus that Simon's
ex-wife killed them, killed a couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: plants out of spite.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was, it was, it's common
knowledge that he lost them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, I always heard that he lost
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but you know, I assumed it was in the
bus and he admitted that he lost one
[SPEAKER_04]: parent, but he never admitted that he lost
more than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he would just never give up the mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just never, you know, that that's
another thing that also really confused me
[SPEAKER_02]: is that I don't understand why they would,
I granted a lot of them were trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: steal each other's clones and steal each
other's seeds or whatever, but if they
[SPEAKER_02]: were breeders, they would know that how
expressions in cannabis work, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they probably like, I would think that
they wouldn't be focused too much on,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, we can't tell them the name or the,
the, the line that this came from because
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll get the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you're aware, uh, Neville's opinion
was they stole most of it from him and
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't want to give him fucking credit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He thought everything is his though,
no matter what.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying it's true, but for whatever
reason, um, you know, like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: what's in chronic?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's, what's, what's Kali missed?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's, what's AK 47?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the parents?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where'd he get the parents?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who gave him the parents?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, um, all that, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they've never come out and say
it and those things came out in the mid
[SPEAKER_04]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're talking 25 years plus of him
being secretive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and yet Neville had an ego and
he thought the whole fucking scene was
[SPEAKER_04]: based on his shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of it was, but some of it was his
ego.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I still think you renamed
Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always, I'm always going to push that
theory and it's based on nothing,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm still going to push it just cause
I can.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, one of the things that I learned
about, uh, that someone just asked,
[SPEAKER_04]: what do I believe in Kali missed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I was told by some guys in Amsterdam
that, um, you know, that the mother plant
[SPEAKER_04]: was this thing called the mango.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was made by this guy that I don't
want to name his name or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it was, it was, he was the guy that
came up with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was at least half of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I see people, uh, uh, you know,
there's people want to talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever, but I mean, the thing is,
is that when I went over there and when I
[SPEAKER_04]: started going over there in the mid
nineties, there was already a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: dudes that were middle-aged that all had
beef with one another.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously Neville and Sam had a bunch
of beef with one another and they sniped
[SPEAKER_04]: at each other for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so there's an aspect, there's an
aspect too, where it's like, sometimes
[SPEAKER_04]: people just didn't want to give other
people credit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't want it to come from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they didn't want it to be that
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't want it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't want to be like, Oh,
well I got that from home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause homie was addicted to them and their
mind, you know, and then they had beef.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then there was politics.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can look at the politics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of nineties, Amsterdam, and you can fast
forward 30 years and it goes on today in
[SPEAKER_04]: California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very common.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the old pictures of Afghani
one that has a lot of similar traits to
[SPEAKER_02]: what you will see in things like super
skunk or even chem 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the things that
originally put me onto that and seeing,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the LA AFI cut that we had,
that was a Afghani number one selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Homie just said, uh, Cali mist was
originally called Western winds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Western winds was one of my favorite all
time, uh, cannabis names, Cambodian,
[SPEAKER_02]: Cambodian.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they said, but I don't fucking
know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's supposedly when they were at cerebral
together, it was the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they broke off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony called his version Western winds and
Simon called his Cali mist, but they were
[SPEAKER_04]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were the, or they, I mean,
maybe they, maybe they made different
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding selections or choices,
but they were the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: The same origin for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say Tony, Tony has been
ridiculously transparent and open with me
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes to asking any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the only Dutch dude who had a seed
bank from back then that never like
[SPEAKER_02]: flinches.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I ask him something, he's always been
super open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it's not like, even if he doesn't
know the answer, he'll tell you,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, I don't really know this game.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought it in bulk from XYZ and that's
what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all we know.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been really fucking cool about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to give props to him for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, maybe, maybe he would
say what it was, but maybe if it came from
[SPEAKER_04]: Simon or he had been for some guy he
didn't like, he wouldn't say it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that goes on today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like people don't want to give other
people credit if they don't like the
[SPEAKER_04]: person, you know, or they feel like they
got jacked on a, I mean, even like
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody like Sam, like if it wasn't for
Mel Frank, uh, I don't, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about it years later, you wouldn't
know that Afghani one and Durban poison
[SPEAKER_04]: came through Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he gave them to Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Sam show.
[SPEAKER_04]: He showed up in Amsterdam with them,
you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, uh, you know, and then,
you know, Tony, Tony has, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then once a line splits, maybe
different breeders make different
[SPEAKER_04]: selections.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They lean it towards one direction or
another, you know, they lose that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and the bubble gum and like the
different ways Simon worked bubblegum
[SPEAKER_02]: supposedly and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know that, I know, I,
you know, I didn't, I didn't know until
[SPEAKER_04]: tonight that, that, uh, Simon's X or
whatever, killed, killed the cut,
[SPEAKER_04]: but Simon's Kali missed in the nineties
was much more sativa leaning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then around 99, 2000, it got shorter
and thicker and more, more Indica,
[SPEAKER_04]: more Afghan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it lost some of the ethical qualities
that I liked a bunch about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's one that I'd really like
to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have the old seats to do it,
but I just, it's one of those ones that
[SPEAKER_02]: like, I'd spend money and time reproducing
it and they would just sit there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and nobody grew up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause Kelly, Mr. Lee isn't one that people
talk about, you know, the average for
[SPEAKER_02]: still in the U S it's fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Finos in Western winds and you can
look in Western winds and Kali missed,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially in like some mid to late
nineties, high times, cannabis cups,
[SPEAKER_04]: like the glossy pictures they would have
in those, in those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, uh, you know, and, um,
you know, so they, uh, they're,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're, those are really nice,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, you know, you know, then,
then he comes out and says, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: true.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean that, like Sam took a bunch
of credit for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just mean that it was like in the list
of stuff that, that Mel, that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, that he brought to Amsterdam and
he didn't obviously say, well,
[SPEAKER_04]: I got these two things from these guys and
I got these from these guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the three Hayes brothers names
that I got these seats.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, it was sketchy back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: You still can't get that shit out of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He still can't get that out of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: All he'll tell me is that I'm wrong about
the history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me what, one day, one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's, uh, one thing about weed is
that people are opinionated and it takes a
[SPEAKER_04]: certain kind of person to take the risks
that we all, we all take and the various
[SPEAKER_04]: things that go on and, you know,
we get beef, you know, and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, but it's, it's also true that
a lot of weed is a flash in the pan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, it might be around for two or
three or four years, five years,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then all of a sudden it's gone or it's
not there in the same, it's not there in
[SPEAKER_04]: the same category anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and there's some, there's some really
good versions of AK that still float
[SPEAKER_04]: around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there was an AK in Colorado that our
good buddy working man and I talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: all the time, that was a huge yielding
beast of a sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and it smelled exactly like sandalwood
did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pure sandalwood turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Matt worked with an AK version that
had strong cherry liqueur.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then lemon, I had a lemon one too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had a lemon, I had the RC cola
fino that used to go around skunk magazine
[SPEAKER_02]: and it smelled like flat cola.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was pretty uncanny.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a pretty wide turp range in the
AK line and, and, and interesting and
[SPEAKER_04]: unique turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of them had some pretty God,
some pretty good highs with them too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so that was a really,
Simon didn't have a lot of strains,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you know, the only, the only strain
that I think he had that was absolute
[SPEAKER_04]: bunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I apologize if you hear this,
Simon is chronic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew out a bunch of chronic and it was
big and midsy and ugly and I never found
[SPEAKER_04]: anything worthwhile in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But his bubble gum and his AK and his
white Russian and his Cali mist and all
[SPEAKER_04]: that, that was all real nice weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think white Russian is totally
underrated too.
[SPEAKER_04]: White Russian is super underrated strain
and it was one of his standards for a long
[SPEAKER_04]: time and it was killer weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some really nice Finos of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I wish I knew, I wish just for
my weed nerdism or whatever, I wish I
[SPEAKER_04]: knew, I, you know, I wish I knew what AK
47 was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if we're getting these cherry
liquor phenotypes is from hexa butyrate,
[SPEAKER_02]: not a turp.
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you think that, I mean,
because we know that during that time
[SPEAKER_02]: there was one real strong cherry kicker
that was being used in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was the either the Holland's hope,
which was a version of the Viking or just
[SPEAKER_02]: using Viking and they were being used
widely at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, I, I've never, now that I know that
it's just like, and how, how commonly it
[SPEAKER_02]: occurs, it almost seems like it would have
to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Chimera and Crybaby both telling
us that the cherry is, is, is from a,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not a turp.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's why, you know,
it's, it's the alls and all, all the
[SPEAKER_04]: various esters and all the various things
that lead to aromas.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not, that's not, that's not
matanized Forte necessarily.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of learning that I could do
over there that would expand my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would love if he told me what was in
it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be really, it would be really
neat just to know, because it's one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: all time great strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The super cool strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's neat that there's it's neat that
there is maybe here's something that we've
[SPEAKER_04]: talked about and that most people don't,
don't think about too much, but we're
[SPEAKER_04]: getting close to the end, but I'll throw
it out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe this is something that like
Chimera could chime in on or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: but what would happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say you have two AK 47s or,
you know, or two NL five hazes or
[SPEAKER_04]: something like that from the nineties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're pretty damn sure that they are
what they are, that they're the exact same
[SPEAKER_04]: era.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the exact same parents.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just two different, two different
plants, but from the same seed line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you reverse one onto the other,
do you get a feminized seed line?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's not an outcross and it's not an
S one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so give me the situation again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say you took, you know, a cherry AK
and crossed it to the Colorado sandalwood
[SPEAKER_04]: AK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not an S one and it's not an
outcross.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when we make up words like in
cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when we make them up because
cannabis is very unique and we've got to
[SPEAKER_02]: make up our own fucking words.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do it with anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could take any, any, anything that you
know are sisters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that came from the same parents,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause most people that are doing
reversals, 99.99% of reversals are either
[SPEAKER_04]: S ones or out process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would, I mean, I know me and Caleb
refer to them as F two R's just when we
[SPEAKER_02]: talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know what we're talking about,
but I don't think there's any standard
[SPEAKER_04]: term because there's a way where it's
like, you know, part of the reason why we
[SPEAKER_04]: do S ones, uh, one of the reasons why we
do it in cannabis at least is because
[SPEAKER_04]: often there's only one phenol.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only one living cut of a certain
line left.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in order for you to look within the
genetics of the line and see what else
[SPEAKER_04]: might be in there, you have to cross it to
itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would make normal lines out of a lot of
these strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Had we a male.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or had we, but if you have two females and
you're sure they're the exact same thing,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you could breed two sisters together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wouldn't be in breeding as much
because they would have two different
[SPEAKER_04]: genetic profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, you're not in, you're not
inbreeding to the extent that an S one
[SPEAKER_04]: would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, you're not, you're not isolating
trades still.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you take, you take a sandalwood
smelling AK 47 and you cross it onto the
[SPEAKER_04]: cherry AK 47.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you, you know, and then you have,
you have a, you have a, a feminized seed
[SPEAKER_02]: line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's what Bitter did with the P 91
S ones took two different P 91 S ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cross them together to create his
next, but the difference is that those are
[SPEAKER_04]: two S ones crossed together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about like two sisters from
the same exact hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see I'm saying that's what it was
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two sisters from the same, because if you
have an S one, if you have two sisters
[SPEAKER_04]: from an S one, there's one parent and S
one has one parent, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's two identical parents.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the genetics is essentially one parent.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you take two sisters from a regular
line, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it's two parents, you know,
and it's like, if you like, for instance,
[SPEAKER_04]: I got multiple daughters.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look at my daughters, they're not two
P's from the same pod.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they have some of they got,
you know, they look very different from
[SPEAKER_04]: each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, my wife and I's jeans popped in
different ways in that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're referring specifically to an F
one hybrid and then using two sisters from
[SPEAKER_02]: that F one hybrid, not from a reversal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I say, for instance, you took,
you know, we can't get, we can't guarantee
[SPEAKER_04]: this, but let's say you took C five and
crossed it to Cuban black.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you were sure, you know, that you're,
or you had two phenos of NL five Haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you knew that the mom was NL five and
the dad was Haze in both.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just two phenos in the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you cross those, you reversed one onto
the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably one of the most rare
things in breeding because then you'd have
[SPEAKER_04]: a feminized line, but it wouldn't be an S
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the only difference between that
and the feminized version would be that
[SPEAKER_02]: the feminized version would have less
variation because there wasn't an
[SPEAKER_02]: additional line at the, what we're calling
the parental level, but that's what I just
[SPEAKER_04]: mean in the sense that, so let's say you
take, let's say you make a cherry AK S
[SPEAKER_04]: one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to only have the gene pool
that's within that specific, that specific
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be going in that direction for
that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you had, if you had a sister of
hers, yes, even though they're sisters,
[SPEAKER_04]: she probably has a different, a slightly
different genetic makeup.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'd be a sibling cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's almost never done because we
almost never have to, it wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_04]: nearly as inbred.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't be nearly as inbred as a,
as a reverse cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'd probably, you'd probably get
like a lot wider expression within the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what's interesting though,
what you're describing is almost exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: what DJ did with blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two things that were, were from the same
parentage, two totally opposite different
[SPEAKER_02]: expressions and constantly recross them
from a small population each generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm not saying that like in a
perfect world, if you had hundreds of
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds, that's the direction that you
should go in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just saying that like there's,
there's an aspect where it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: if all you have in the line is one living,
living example, then you, all you can do
[SPEAKER_04]: is self it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you got two, then you could widen
the gene pool just slightly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And have, and have a group of seeds that
had a slightly wider gene pool than you
[SPEAKER_04]: could get with S one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think like, if you keep,
like he did it with Moonbow 99 and Moonbow
[SPEAKER_02]: 112.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you do that and you keep doing
it in successive generations, which you
[SPEAKER_02]: get is a lot of mutants and weirdness
without necessarily the narrowed down
[SPEAKER_02]: variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just thinking in terms of like
nineties weed or various things where you
[SPEAKER_04]: might get lucky and you might have one or
you might have two or even three phenos
[SPEAKER_04]: that might exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like where, it wouldn't be that,
that would probably be, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's just something that's not
often done, but if there's two phenos from
[SPEAKER_04]: the same line, you might be able to figure
it out, but it's almost never done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think of somebody that think of somebody
that has it often.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's almost like back crossing
to a male.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't see back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't see back crosses to males often
done, but it's an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It has its place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, in terms of, I mean, in terms of
most genetic preservation, we're like
[SPEAKER_04]: super lucky if one pheno of an old line
survives.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but in the case of, in the case
of NL five by Hayes C, there's probably
[SPEAKER_04]: three or four or five that survived.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot more than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if we really knew for sure,
I think there'd be a lot more,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and so there's potential where
you could, you could, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you could, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just interesting in that,
in that regard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Project sea monster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are not siblings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not fucking siblings.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we, we hoped that, we hoped that,
that Phylos and some other, and some other
[SPEAKER_04]: genetic groups would be able to prove
these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has not happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Phylos got everybody's money because they
promised they would be able to show what
[SPEAKER_04]: was a grandparent, what was a child,
what was a, what was a daughter,
[SPEAKER_04]: what was a mother and not, not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're still going to do a full episode
on that eventually, on why, why we were
[SPEAKER_02]: able to prove that it was a broken system,
effectively prove it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you're going to give it a little
bit of time so people don't get too butt
[SPEAKER_02]: hurt and Sue and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but it's, it's just one of those
things where, between know whether males
[SPEAKER_04]: or females are responsible.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no, there's no, you know,
there's a lot of, there's a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: that, because, because cannabis for a long
time has been,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, I just, I was just going to say that
cannabis for a long time has been deprived
[SPEAKER_04]: of science or the science aspect of,
of breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of it is observational by people
still to this day.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some people that, there are some
people that are doing, that are doing
[SPEAKER_04]: work, that are using a lot more scientific
methods and things like that, but it's
[SPEAKER_04]: rare still.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most cannabis breeding is observational.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's hard to know males and
females.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we just don't have, we just,
we just were denied up until 10 fit 10
[SPEAKER_04]: years ago or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were mostly denied labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were mostly denied access to what,
you know, normal breeders would be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: use all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to do a giveaway before we're
done, since we're almost at two hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually thought of something to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you didn't have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like we used to do back in the,
back in, I don't know a year or two ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked out a phrase.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was going to be a blank spot in this
phrase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whoever comes up with who we all agree
is the funniest.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best answer gets the bomb threat
bubble Hawaiian lights hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the more expensive ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to get it out there so people
can, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so we have a few different ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, if you want to participate,
you're going to have to fill in the blank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rub-a-dub-dub blank in a tub.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who has the best answer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Rub-a-dub-dub your answer in a tub.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who has the best answer?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, this one should be nice and
creative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rub-a-dub-dub blank in a tub.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rub-a-dub-dub dank in a tub.
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 VC in a tub.
[SPEAKER_02]: These nuts is always a great response.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiddling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tug in a tub.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sub in a tub.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that did exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did exist.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have to pin this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we remember who did sub in a tub to see
if someone could beat him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what you got.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those pictures of sub in the tub were,
were not cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I remember when I made the,
the now I'm not going to say it since he's
[SPEAKER_02]: no longer with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just weren't, they just, you know,
pretty 79 RKS seeds in the tub in the tub.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sub in his camera in a tub.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the thing about sub in the tub is
that it rhymes too, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's creative.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want p-bud in the tub either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sub should win.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rub-a-dub-dub sub is in a tub.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to wear my p-bud shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got another p-bud shirt from my
buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forgot it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think, I think we're going to
have to go with Tri Grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send me a, send me a DM after this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the, the Hawaii, the bomb threat
of a Hawaiian lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's, it's, it's, it can't beat
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're almost, we're almost to two
hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll do our normal little thing here
on Friday night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, as always, we're down to totally
talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of what we talked about tonight was
suggestions from people on our discord,
[SPEAKER_04]: asking us to chat about certain things.

want talked about, talked about is reach
[SPEAKER_04]: out to us either on IG or joining our
discord, which Matt always explains at the
[SPEAKER_04]: end.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but we're always down to chat about
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, some episodes are kind of formal in
the sense that we have a whole theme that
[SPEAKER_04]: we want to go off of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and some of them are, uh, some of them
are, are, are a little bit more loose and,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, interactive.

up the second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we just had some cool fights last week
that we, we hang out, talk shit to each
[SPEAKER_02]: other and watch the fights, which has
nothing to do with cannabis, but hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something else to do.
