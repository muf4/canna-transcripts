[SPEAKER_00]: All right, how's everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking lights bright as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we fucking go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you guys up to?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done a live feed in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I woke up in time too.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't sleep through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll wait till people start rolling in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say that that's Bryn's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I blame her for the the witchcraft shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I'm not a religious man myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nor do I have the power to use intention
to bend my will.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's become very fucking obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so what are we gonna fucking talk
about today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, we can talk about UFOs if you
guys want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could talk about fucking serial
killers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could talk about whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd run a heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss an FYP play at fucking punk rock
bowling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so bummed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bummed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd kill to see FYP right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last show I went to was a Toys That
Kill one and I'm just not I was never a
[SPEAKER_00]: big Toys That Kill fan, but I'd love to
see FYP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sad, but I also don't want to be around
a bunch of fucking COVID spreading dirty
[SPEAKER_00]: punks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Blue Dream trash or fire?
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on what Blue Dream you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a Blue Dream that isn't the the
old SC cut, then probably trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I haven't really seen good Blue
Dreams aside from the old cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you usually know someone
says Blue Dream sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either their shit grow or they never had
the real cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: How weed came from the serious A and B and
how it's being you never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe it was what's the word?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not panspermia, but the galactic spermia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's how fucking weed came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think other entities have cannabis
wherever they're from?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that they've figured out how
to get high off other shit, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe they know how to trigger their
own brain chemistry through whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if I believe that there
are other things outside of humans,
[SPEAKER_00]: a very unfortunate humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been studying UFO since I was a
young kid, very young kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my evolution through beliefs has been
very fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's had to be because it took me a
long time to realize how many people were
[SPEAKER_00]: con artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's just like any field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any field you get into, whether it's
cannabis or the UFO world, everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking trying to make money off something
with some agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your favorite strain still the
strawberry switchblade?
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite strains are usually berry
based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to bring it back sometime soon,
but it's really hard to tell what the
[SPEAKER_00]: market wants right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last live feed I did, I talked a
little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiny, tiny little bit about.
[SPEAKER_00]: About that and the decline of the cannabis
industry and how fast it's hitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you classify a generation after
open pollination?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, if you're taking it back to
an open pollination, then the next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation technically not by scientific
standards would be an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it's used in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just stick with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other people can understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about Irene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irene came from smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rude boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rude boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out of a bag of weed originally
and someone was selling it as Irene and
[SPEAKER_00]: they tried to get that cut or didn't get
the cut or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they found a cut later on that
was so much like that weed that they
[SPEAKER_00]: called it Irene again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the cut that we now have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more Irene too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the only one that people
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the market doesn't know what it
wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an ignorant ass market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I say that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That hurts people's feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any breeders out there that work
lines anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a few, but there's not, there's not,
what's that smoke to herb?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not, there's not a demand for work
lines right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes time, generations to work lines
and you can't stay above the curve if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, if you're working lines and that's
really the way it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like strains are good enough
or do you think breeding is still in need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good enough for who?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good enough for who is the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like some people are happy with
cookies and cookies hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Origins of sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a long one to go into.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a long one to go into,
but basically it's a super skunk of sorts,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a super skunk, but it came
via Vondo and Manny and Klopp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are three names that you can legit
associate with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains alien shmeggy is what it
contains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time work wasn't an old school TGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was at the end of TGA.
Let's
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super skunk chem, I would say that that is
a good assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem 91 or a chem bag seed crossed to
whatever super skunk was going around and
[SPEAKER_00]: since we know there were like two
different super skunk types going around
[SPEAKER_00]: at that time, it's one of those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's during an era where we don't know
which cup was passed a super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does everyone have some really,
I don't know what you're asking,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think you're asking if people really
have super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's readily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that said, no, for some reason,
nobody's using real super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not nobody, but very few people
are using real super skunk in their lines
[SPEAKER_00]: that are calling shit super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them don't know how to
identify what super skunk is in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snowdog is still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that cut anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine came via Matt Elite, but I don't know
if he was holding it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very similar to Giselle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up mid-style Broganics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are your favorite breeders?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that's the question I always get and
like I'm always, I hate doing it because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so many people I would forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I hate just naming a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but you can see who like I interact
with, who's stuff I use, who are our tight
[SPEAKER_00]: friend crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a reason we're all close.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because we all respect each other in
our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't Skunk V.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: popularize super super de kinky or mass
super?
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk V.A., his mentor was the person who
popularized the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Skunk V.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: is a reason, one of the reasons that it
was in several people's hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say, yes, that's that's
partially correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you name some African strange red
Congo?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed the herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite was the Senegalese Haze from
Afro Pip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is no longer with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's the Malawi, there's
fucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go through some of the boof Swazi,
Swazi Ruyvard, which is Swazi Redbeard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Durban poison from the from
Durban, South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have Kenyan, you have Nigerian.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of different different
areas that had their own specific lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can't comment on Top Dog Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't comment on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't tried it, haven't haven't smelled
it, haven't smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But visually, super skunk is very easy to
identify for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, elephant ear from Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've never heard of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that fucking quote unquote
elephant ear tie that that that tweaker
[SPEAKER_00]: ass Golden Coast was showing and passing
to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a big old fucking broadleaf
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk lovers could look into Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just bad info.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the worst info I've ever heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, if you like skunk smells,
go look at Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I spent 15 years telling people that
that is the the one thing don't do is
[SPEAKER_00]: waste your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you think nobody is finding skunk
in Skunk One?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, why would you pass that
advice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you just don't know and you're just
passing advice for shits and gigs,
[SPEAKER_00]: which whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most greasy indica you can find in seed
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on what you consider indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, greasy Afghani, Pakistani,
maybe Chitral is a little greasier than
[SPEAKER_00]: most.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about Ego's genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: I never heard of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever experience skunk in the 90s?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, does that compare to the cuts?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am way too young.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like during the 90s, I was smoking
brickweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's just what we had at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time skunk had had declined was
about the time I started by like really
[SPEAKER_00]: dang shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was Cornbread Mafia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornbread Mafia was a group of guys that
all were working in the like what the
[SPEAKER_00]: South Florida, Louisiana and that region
moving a lot of weed back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk in Black Domino.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were so many different versions of
Black Domino, and I've never seen a really
good version.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen a good one myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you talking about skunk one or are you
talking about does it have skunky turps?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those are two different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your skunk one was light floral smells
with some odd smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the way you recommended fucking
skunk one for skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't even have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only skunk I had was AAA skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never heard of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top notch OG Kush you've ever tried.
Triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking the Kush cut by a resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Louis OG is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: My girl, Tokyo Roses Tokyo OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to give her a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if that's still around
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's all kinds of great OGs
that are fucking the same exact cut to
[SPEAKER_00]: with different names or bag seed thereof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think Giesel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Crusted cheese would be funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that it has potential,
but because UK cheese also expresses as
[SPEAKER_00]: fruity, sweet, berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aside from just cheese, I would think that
it would throw a lot of variation and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably not be the most ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you, in theory, if you had a big
enough pop of the seeds, you might be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to find it or in the F2 generation of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever had NorCal lavender?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, so many people consider lavender so
many different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, you want strawberry turps back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I bring back strawberry?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we might.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think bitters might be doing some
strawberry work very soon and we will be
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, I got them F2 roadkill strip tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about Blue Bonnet for those
of us that don't know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Blue Bonnet was made by Lone Star
from Texas Resident Company, who's no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was releasing that at the same time I
was releasing my first RiotBerry stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: working those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the time, I didn't pay any attention
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was competition and I was an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, I was like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the best.
Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need his shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over time, as a lot of seed makers did
back then, we sold every last bit of our
[SPEAKER_00]: stock of shit because it was not easy to
make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't have any more of my RiotBerry
stuff and I lost them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew I'd have to go back and revisit
Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I did, I had kept that in my mind
all those years ago that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple people had told me that the
Bonnet was a great place for Blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: muffin turps and Blueberry candy and all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I popped those along with I can't
remember how many other blue lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was a shitload.
[SPEAKER_00]: A shitload old and new blue lines by DJ's
work and others work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And others work with DJ's work,
which is what Blue Bonnet supposedly is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the most supreme blue breeding line
I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hands down, better than anything I ever
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm being honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a bummer that I was such
an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't reach out to Lone Star back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't try to collaborate or work with
them, but we live and learn, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: best I could do is honor his work now and
make sure he still gets the respect he
[SPEAKER_00]: deserved back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's what Blue Bonnet is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's a perfect blue breeding line
for, for berry turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to show it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys decorate your watering cans?
[SPEAKER_00]: Print decorates ours.
Here.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just finished this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit's pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does good work.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's getting all nervous now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want people to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think UK cheese is more skunk than
skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's just skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a selection of skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: JJ said in a podcast at Mass Super Skunk
that Greg had is different than the one
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk gay posted old pics of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: JJ is a thousand percent correct in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else have we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know, what do you know about
blueberry muffin top?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never heard of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every girl showing share, uh, loans to her
sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only person who would ask about blue
skies, Vienna, it would be blue skies,
[SPEAKER_00]: V and uh, so bye bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's that stupid now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about your G's last ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a, it's a super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's so for a long time,
G's was considered or, or recorded as a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a, a mass super.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross to chem dog D reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now nobody was doing reversals back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was implying that Chem D had hermed
on the mass super.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, Chem D does not normally spit
viable pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very unlikely, very unlikely that the
pollen donor, even if it does her however,
[SPEAKER_00]: mass super skunk was a herm bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, when you make it,
when you, when you put the S ones out,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you do the crosses, you don't see any
Chem D in the crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you see a ton of super skunk,
tons and tons of super skunk, but nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: cushy, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and when I say cushy, I don't mean
like Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just mean like those tight, really dense
buds, super frosty, like a, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D expresses very heavy Afghani to me
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if I answered that,
but whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have any new projects you're excited
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, me and me and the homie have,
uh, uh, CSI have some cool shit going on
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say what it is just
because people will pretend they've
[SPEAKER_00]: already done it and release it tomorrow
and a bunch of dummies will go buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So leave it at that, but expect some good
things in the next few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the crosses is the most
homogeneous with the least amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: phenos?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would say deep chunk, deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to, if you want to get
something close to IBL, deep chunks,
[SPEAKER_00]: a great selection for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, oddly enough, uh, Cedar Berry Farms,
uh, strawberry sour, which was the East
[SPEAKER_00]: coast sour diesel, uh, cut from,
uh, uh, devil's harvest crew, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is probably the same one as the
Choco cut that I call the Choco cut or
[SPEAKER_00]: some people just call ECSD, um,
cross to strawberry cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, it was amazingly uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what else we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some GMO blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to see you fucking pop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry muffin at wedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would anybody buy that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got wedding cake crust, a blue bonnet
with actual blue turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry muffin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that shit out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, the blueberry muffin cut
was our old cut, but a few years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: some dumb fucks up in Humboldt decided to
take the name, slap it on their shit to
[SPEAKER_00]: give it some hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I just don't, I used to give a
lot of shits about shit like that because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so disrespectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this day and age, everybody's
fucking ripping each other's shit off that
[SPEAKER_00]: like, if I, if I got mad every time
someone ripped my shit off or took a name
[SPEAKER_00]: or, or did something stupid, like I'd just
be mad all day and I try not to be too
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave that up to Brynn.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most potent orange strain doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, skunk one more predominantly fruity
turps or skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no skunk in skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no skunk in skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, fillings on Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba Kush is one of my favorite,
um, cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite lines to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's not much hype for Bubba
Kush, so there's not going to be a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: done with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're going to stub your pinky
toe if you don't drop some episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have episodes recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just, we've been doing a lot trying
to, to reprep my site, get credit cards
[SPEAKER_00]: up, which right now credit cards are up
and, um, we accept all forms or most forms
[SPEAKER_00]: of, um, cryptocurrency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, uh, let's see, I wrote some stuff
down that I got to say, cause I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you, if you go sign up at our site,
uh, on the Riot site and you, you
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically get $10 worth of funds in
your account.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a new member, bam,
you get 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, to spend at the site and you get
discounts when you sign up to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you sign up to, uh, speakeasy
Patreon, you get, you can multiply the
[SPEAKER_00]: discounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in both Patreons and I think
it's $5 a month, um, you get access to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also right now, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still take credit cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I don't think most people know
that yet, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did some house cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, crybaby ever beyond breeder
syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there, there was a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba Kush versus SoCal, SoCal cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's not much of a difference if
you ask me, but I mean, if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: pick it apart, it would be by growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like.
[SPEAKER_00]: In, in certain rooms, certain environments
are both going to look pretty goddamn
[SPEAKER_00]: similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the SoCal master Kush cut had a lot
more purple tendency to it in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, didn't breed it as heavy, whereas
Bubba was the reverse of that for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It bred a lot of purple traits and,
um, but the plant didn't really turn
[SPEAKER_00]: purple itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have yet to find a seed with the
LAD herming the final tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not cool that it harms, but you know,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Pakistan should try Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned you hated those turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it dark and robust herbs?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't hate Chitral turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Chitral does have a lot of,
um, turpentine in it, which for something
[SPEAKER_00]: that isn't like, uh, a haze-ish type is,
is kind of, uh, unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the old Chitral like that wasn't
line bred towards being purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like the one that ACE released early
on, um, that one had a lot of lemon to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the green phenos were super lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not a big lemon guy, but it was,
it was a nice lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like in your face, like
offensive lemon, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the blackberries in there,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just depends on if you like
blackberry, uh, turps or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one of my crosses is the most
homogenous with few phenos?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would say banana tie is probably the
most homogenous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there are different phenos in it,
but most of them all kind of center around
[SPEAKER_00]: one general look that is the, the,
um, juicy fruit tie mom and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's see, chunky monkey, which is
probably because of deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also very uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, bubble berries been pretty uniform,
oddly enough, but, but those two just
[SPEAKER_00]: combined so well to, to not to have too
many fricking phenos in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what else in the newest, uh,
the, uh, the white bonnet was very
[SPEAKER_00]: homogenous as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super roadkill, mentholated, cherry cola.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nasty Nate calls all the strange common
names that are, I have no idea who nasty
[SPEAKER_00]: Nate's.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up Tony?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do any work with Kush Fort?
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, how do you know when to harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you lost your scope, where you just
pick some dry it and figure out where you
[SPEAKER_00]: like to smoke it at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, we need that riot coin,
that riot crypto, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that'd do good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is papaya just green crack?
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, those, those dudes wouldn't have even
had access to green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, no, I'm going to say no on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think you will create an heirloom
strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course it takes time, but do you have
any faves you plan to FJ?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and to create an heirloom strain,
I would have to get everyone across the
[SPEAKER_00]: country growing it all at once and they
all want cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, as far as working lines,
God, it's been years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I just, just no place for it
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no place for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if people would actually like
understand that that's a good thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: have worked lines, um, and want uniformity
in their garden and uniformity for
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and making seeds, then yeah,
we could go back to that, but there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's just no, it's not financially
viable in this, in this community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like nobody gives a fuck about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to tuck in a wedding cake
and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or else it fucking people hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you speak on mob or Jerry Berry?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the mob cut going around,
it's just a, a minute of purpose
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't think it's anything special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but it does breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're making blueberry lines,
I'll give it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but as far as it being Jerry Berry,
I doubt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cut going around probably has nothing
to do with the original, um, mob cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I talk about uncle Fester?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not, not what's being passed as uncle
Fester skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncle Fester is this old fucking like drug
chemist guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he may have done breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but the person who was
pushing uncle Fester skunk had nothing to
[SPEAKER_00]: do with uncle Fester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't know uncle Fester wasn't even
around for uncle Fester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I really think it was just taking
his name and slapping it on something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you grown any of Karel's stuff from
SSSE?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waiting for some more outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, space to, to be popping that long
flower and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, does the blue bonnet too yield well
and height and all of the blue bonnet
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, uh, washes extremely well and,
and rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been having really good results with
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the kind of, the kind of,
um, trichomes that the, the male pushed
[SPEAKER_00]: and they, and the amount of resin
production that the male pushed into these
[SPEAKER_00]: lines is pretty fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's perfect for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malibu pure Kush had the cakiest turps
I've ever smelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever come across that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never come across a cut called Malibu
pure Kush, but I do remember real pure
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush and SoCal pure Kush that also people
have called Shignite pure Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: which had nothing to do with it and was a
bubble hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've seen people call it Malibu
pure Kush and Hollywood pure Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I only know one and that is the pure
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't say it was super cakey,
uh, for me, but again, it depends on how
[SPEAKER_00]: you grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you grow determines the expression of
whatever phenotype you're trying to pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some, some cuts are more uniform,
like depending on your, your environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: some cuts really do well at staying very
uniform at how they express.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of others, like UK cheese,
for example, can come out fucking,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking like two different fucking whole
different plants that you wouldn't believe
[SPEAKER_00]: were the same cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you work if money was no issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good one, Shawnee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right now I go back and work the
strawberry stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd work it really heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, specifically the East Coast sour
diesel strawberry cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to do some work with that and my
strawberry switch blade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, probably do more with the banana tie,
to be honest with you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and if money was no issue,
some of the blue bonnet stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, the banana headband, I'd like to do
more work with, cause there was some cool
[SPEAKER_00]: shit coming out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the grape pie, um, platinum banana OG
made some beautiful stuff that's relevant
[SPEAKER_00]: or would do well in today's market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's worthy of being around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not just another fucking cookies
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a sour apple, platinum banana OG also
was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as far as being worked, I think that
there's, there's some cool shit in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything new or is it all the
same?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, I mean, just look, just look at
what's around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything looks like fucking wedding cake
or gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have the original blue
badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get it from archives?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a, the reason I'm laughing is
cause it's a very bold claim to say you
[SPEAKER_00]: have the original blueberry, like cite
your source.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your provenance?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's, you know, like DJ claims the same
thing, you know, as does fucking that
[SPEAKER_00]: other dildo who calls himself the original
DJ short of Jaime Chiba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they all claim it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say they have the original
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a cut from Oregon that is the
Oregon blueberry that archive sells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott reach moonshine man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the original?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't fucking know about all that shit,
but it wasn't the first one that people
[SPEAKER_00]: saw, but it's good.
Supposedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you pop any electric lemonade?
[SPEAKER_00]: My pack had some crazy tourist couple of
herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be the problem with the
lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just is part of lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, usually they're very sterile,
so they don't cause a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you, if you, if you run lemon tree
hybrids, you're just going to end up
[SPEAKER_00]: getting herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you want to curb a lot of that,
and I always recommend this to people and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, I very rarely see, see it taken
seriously, but take clones from your seed
[SPEAKER_00]: moms and run the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed moms have a lot of hormones in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and taking clones of it and
running that allows it to acclimate a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit to your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a, there are many reasons that
it is more advantageous to run clones as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to your seed mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, the, you lose a little bit of
vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I mean, seed moms are more vigorous
than clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the trade-off are, are tenfold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not everybody wants hype,
but not enough people want, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: old work lines or any lines that aren't
hype to make it matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of people, I get that people
like it, but people don't spend the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a, they don't have a
market share buying power, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, if this is your career and
livelihood, then you just got to go with
[SPEAKER_00]: the flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's why a lot of people are fucking
retiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people from my heritage are
fucking retiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's sick of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart, soil, pre pre BS.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on two bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never even heard of any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never heard of any of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck is even hyper.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the brokers probably look like a bunch
of dudes sitting on their boards and wait
[SPEAKER_00]: list day open for a new way to suddenly
appear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, gelato bullshit renamed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up old song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of old school dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, have your penis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll check my DM Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would try rainbow belts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what Fletcher brought to
the party a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is banana strains, indica dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what you consider indica and
Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are kind of old terms that,
that a lot of us don't use anymore,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we kind of have to keep using because
it's still common nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it depends on what it's crossed to
obviously, but banana OG tends to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: more narrow lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf selections of OJ Kush because of the
60 40 in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from an old man that has held onto
the one plant since he started growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's about 70 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool story, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you still cool with the BDSC guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the proof is in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's, that's the dumbest shit
I've ever heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proof is not in the pudding that you
have an original blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this old man told me, yeah,
you know, like I would love to believe
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but that doesn't necessarily make it
so, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, um, I'd love to believe
it, but it just, with everybody talking
[SPEAKER_00]: and making up bullshit stories,
it's just another story until you actually
[SPEAKER_00]: have proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, provenance is a serious thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like saying, Oh, I got this original
Picasso.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where'd you get it from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some old man gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know it's original?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he said proofs in the pudding,
you know, it's like, what the fuck are you
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I mean, archive himself says that that
blueberry cut is midsy boof.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't expect a lot of dank from it,
but, um, it supposedly has good blue
[SPEAKER_00]: turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ's flowers were wet basement trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all blueberry has been from DJ for
like fucking 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up vessel?
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is the perfect curing in your
opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a lot of the strawberry cream cuts
and, and different phenos that came out of
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry cream and the hybrids,
they would be better with less of a cure
[SPEAKER_00]: oddly enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you feel about the next generation
of growers and where the gene pool is
[SPEAKER_00]: headed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are some next generations
that are fucking dudes doing it right,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're going to get buried just like
we were, you know, so whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the heaviest daily smoke habit
you've encountered?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who would I put that to?
[SPEAKER_00]: My old friend noob, noob 78.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would fucking, he out-chiefed everyone
at, um, the first Colorado cannabis cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude could fucking puff like
ridiculous where everybody else is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and this is a room of heavy
smokers all finally passed out and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: still me and him are out the last few,
uh, umpapas that way too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, there's some, there's two
getting fucking chief.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the heaviest daily smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chocolate ties still around in seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, some people still use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doral's chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, is that the original?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but that's what's considered
to be chocolate tie now in the past decade
[SPEAKER_00]: or so for, if all the old school breeders
retire, we're going to end up with
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit gelato cookies crap, then support
them because, and I'm not even talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about the best of the best,
like CSI, um, archives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some crosses with it that are
beautiful and smell really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the gelato 33 gelato 45, even the 41.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but at this point, everything has been
done and then some, and now it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: constant cookie inbreeding and that's
gives a fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm way, way behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: By proof is in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm a smoker and I could tell the
difference just like you can, but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell the difference that it's an original
blueberry or.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be a Dick, but I mean,
it's just bold claims require bold
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence, you know, and anything we UFOs
fucking how long your Dick is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I mean, I could smoke any number
of things that someone hands me randomly
[SPEAKER_00]: and just, I couldn't tell if it was the
original cut, especially with blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: being that, you know, it's just one of
those things, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'll tell the B I did tell the BDSC
story already, um, because he was once a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to get too far into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I just, I felt very fucked over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I handed them a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave them every single breeder that they
had to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they went there because I was there
and I was vouching for them and they
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fucked me over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's the long and short of it,
you know, and they did dirty shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did dirty shit that I had to keep
looking past constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are fucking scumbags.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, Oh, you're hunting through snitch
genetics UFO.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of gets bland with a long cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any thoughts on rat snitch, motherfucking
dork, sour diesel BXs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone else made them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had nothing to do with them and it's
from swerve shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I got to say about that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get Corel back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to have Corel back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to have him back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you guys stoked about Karma Sour?
[SPEAKER_00]: You do realize it comes out smelling like
OG and, um, or just cardboard terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very not sour, but it looks,
it looks like a super skunk, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't have any other stuff that
goes with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it's half swerves shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe just go buy swerve shit instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least swerve isn't a snitch like Karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when are you making another Instagram
for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that's not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flan, Flanville, uh, social.flanville.com
is another option.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all need to start using, I'm waiting
for him to get some live feed options so I
[SPEAKER_00]: can start utilizing it like I'd like to,
but yeah, that's, that's another good
[SPEAKER_00]: option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, man, yeah, it's bleak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and Joey, I could agree with you
on, on blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love blueberry because if you find the
fucking perfect Fino that's super blue
[SPEAKER_00]: terps, um, potent and frosty and all of
the dude, there's nothing I like more than
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: He needs to be more selective of what they
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I mean, but the community is
very uneducated, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and not Mary, not talking about you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like everybody that comes in here
more or less wants to learn like what's
[SPEAKER_00]: why things are the way they are,
why our scene is the way it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it got to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most people are interested in history
and or genetics if they're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but in generally, generally speaking,
the guys that go into fucking cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: clubs to go buy their fucking weed that
don't even grow, they're never going to
[SPEAKER_00]: give a fuck about any of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they drive the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are what drives the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're the ones going and buying the
stuff that, that, that growers are
[SPEAKER_00]: offloading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're the majority buyers and I'm
not talking black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking white market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the black markets getting fucking
school washed right now by corporate
[SPEAKER_00]: assholes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, do you know what blue dragon is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about Jinx Proof's line?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever any of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Jinx Proof is a super, super nice
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been around a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's, he's one of the most like cheery
inspiring guys I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't say a bad word about that,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever started any projects with
the NL?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and CSI are working on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually doing selections and taking
time with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike the other person who's been selling
them, like from the jump popped a few
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and fucking crossed them and was
like, Hey, I got an old five.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's original.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, what you got is a fucking two Finos
that you hit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fucking schmuck, but we're going to do
it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also going to be available for free
for veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that is a promise on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're also doing the Hawaiian lights,
which is the BX to the Hawaiian inside and
[SPEAKER_00]: all five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of being like mostly NL five
dominant, this is going to be mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian dominant in the NL five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're running through those popped all
the seeds and we're going to go through
[SPEAKER_00]: all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does skunk V8?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't tell people who to fuck
with and who not to fuck with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when that went down, I didn't,
I didn't message any of my friends and be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Hey, you know what they did to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how bad they fucked me over?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not looking to sink people's
businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, they just fucked me over.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they weren't fucking other people
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I couldn't say that they were going to
fuck him over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that they, they weren't
fucking anyone over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was the one dumb enough to hand
them a fucking business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the way it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are UFOs, first UFO question from a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are UFOs real?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something is flying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's aliens or not,
but something's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm sure a lot of it is us drone tech,
Chinese drone tech, Russian drone tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drones have been around since world war
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people don't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, why do you always seem to be the one
on the short side of the stick,
[SPEAKER_00]: but everyone seems to have the problem
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because I, I've been stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been stupid at who I brought into our
friend crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I, for every person I brought
into our friend crew, there's been one
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had to throw out of the friend crew
for fucking over the friend crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of people call people out when
they fuck them over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not very edited.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't noticed, it's just one of
those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made a lot of bad decisions,
but it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't trust people in the fucking weed
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few, very, very few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of the friends that I've had in
this community I've had for many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many years over decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's also been a lot that we've
lost, you know, just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, who are some new guests coming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so still coasting, not so,
uh, not so supposed to be doing a solo
[SPEAKER_00]: shit, but he hasn't recorded anything yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if he's going to
participate this season or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, I'm not sure on the cohosting spot
yet of what's going on or how it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing some stuff with Shawnee kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the Canadian stuff, but as far as the
main, main spot, I'm not sure how it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still trying to figure everything
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Jim Ortega would be dope to talk to
you, but he doesn't really seem to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swerve and Skunk V.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to speak for him,
but I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, and that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some of the old schoolers like
Swerve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swerve has been very duplicitous and a
piece of shit to me specifically,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't blame my friends that are
friends with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I don't give a shit for
being friends of that dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he's been nice to, um, Cedarberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cedarberry flipped out on me for being
mean to Swerve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just is one of those things,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: High and Lonesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: When will we see more Appy work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and High and Lonesome have been
supposed to do more Appy work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I hope if I don't get to it soon
that he does, because that's probably one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the best, um, short flowering sativa
type lines there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think he could easily replace Blue
Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or any of that because of its potency,
its look, its yield, its unique turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's one, it's one cups under other
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of people associate with Bodie
because Bodie did a whole long list of
[SPEAKER_00]: lines with it, but that is my boy High and
Lonesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I was going to hit the Archive
Blueberry, uh, with, with the bonnet to
[SPEAKER_00]: see what would happen, but it did,
the cut didn't live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your latest string was Crack Daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember my buddy HBK had a string
called Crack Daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used dark green crack, uh, work in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: High and Lonesome says I'm not much of a
breeder dude, but he's like one of the few
[SPEAKER_00]: actual breeders there have ever been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, did, did he sell all the Appy stuff he
wasn't supposed to sell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two currents is a piece of shit and he's
going to, I'm going to leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude's, that dude, you don't,
you don't, you don't call my friends liars
[SPEAKER_00]: that are fucking, especially not one of
the most honest dudes I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, little fucking maggot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, uh, how do we get in the crew?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all kind of stumbled into our crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, we all kind of found each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your podcast that the Hayes Brothers Kush
has some wine in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's in the Hayes Brothers
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody has any clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody has any clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say probably Hindu Kush based,
but I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very early on in the eighties or
yeah, eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much variation would I find if I S1 to
BX F2?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how much work was put into
the initial line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be someone that did a backcross
of an F2 that has no idea about selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you S1 that you may open the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just, you're going to have
less phenos than in the initial BX1 S2 if
[SPEAKER_00]: you just S1 it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if the line is very open,
you're just going to have an open line.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that makes sense for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say is the biggest smoking
gum when it comes to UFOs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's a few cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the Tenerife Island, Canary Islands
one is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm correct, I think I'm correct on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One or two of, of what was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were so many witnesses and it was
such a extreme event that it's really hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to shut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the aerial school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incident, which I mean, it's kids that
witnessed it, but it was a lot of kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of different
descriptions, but overall it's very,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a very interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it, I don't really believe in mass
hallucinations like that unless people are
[SPEAKER_00]: dosed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's another good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, our buddy Alex Dietrich, the,
the fighter pilot in, um, that had to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Nimitz incident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, she's a, she is actually trained in
cognitive bias, which is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons that I really, really,
um, respect her opinion on what she saw in
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's a trippy one, but you know,
some people are very insistent that the
[SPEAKER_00]: Nimitz was, was not what we thought it
was, but she had eyes on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as a, as a fighter pilot,
um, one of the best fighter pilots,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's something that's saying something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry blast, ever tried it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I had a lot of friends that did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather run blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no person reason to run that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, 16 years since I first found you,
night times.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I was blocked before I was booted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever had the chance to do any
blue moonshine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some for sale right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the blue baby shit V2 is a,
uh, uh, blue moonshine cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a blue moonshine, blue bonnet,
blue moonshine being some of DJ's work and
[SPEAKER_00]: having some of those muddy butt hole
turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre nine, maybe Guy was referring to that
pre 98 blueberry Pacific Northwest took to
[SPEAKER_00]: the facility we were at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre 98 blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I don't even know what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I remember JD short little Dick short,
um, telling everyone that his daddy made
[SPEAKER_00]: up the term pre 98, but his daddy did not
make up the term pre 98.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I feel about rare Dickless from
Colorado?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the dude's been around a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had no respect for him because he
was an asshole and that was that seven
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes in the closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selections matter very heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can give an example actually,
from my boy, bitter, um, the P 91 S ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were very variant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they all kind of circled around that
peanut oil turp, but there were ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: had low resin production and high resin
production in just one generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, better was able to make the P 91 S
twos actually F two Rs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it was, it wasn't necessarily a self
selection, but by doing that selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was able to make it way more resinous,
way more resinous in, in, in increased how
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome that line was 10 fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's, that's a perfect example
of why selections matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's the difference between
playing and doing and knowing what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two currents is a little fucking new poser
who took a bunch of testers and made a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of promises.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't going to use shit and then
fucking used it and sold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just a little fucking coward who just
started growing and immediately started
[SPEAKER_00]: selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if y'all fuck with them, you've
probably been growing longer than him.
[SPEAKER_00]: LA lights, 1960s, I believe over 30,000
people saw UFO.
[SPEAKER_00]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not familiar with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was the, uh, the battle of Los
Angeles, but I don't believe there were a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of witnesses to stuff, but they were
firing a lot of ammunition in the air and
[SPEAKER_00]: people died from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A UFO response vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Max?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want pictures of this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What traits do you focus on when you're
hunting a male?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't always look for the same traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on what I'm trying to
breed or what I'm trying to make at that
[SPEAKER_00]: specific point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Muddy butthole turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue munchen was the first thing I smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got out of no anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some people, blueberry very
anxious, but for me, it is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-anxiety stuff I can smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry haze, blueberry haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's where blue dream came from
blueberry, super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two cowards is a great name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, that's what most people
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hit the first Fino you find with
males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's, here's something, here's
something that a lot of people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're selecting a male, there is no
real criteria that works for all males.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, when, when making hybrids,
it should be common sense, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't to me when I first started,
I always use the criteria that,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I like to, and this is what I was
taught by, by James Hod was that you look
[SPEAKER_00]: for the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's most like the female you want to
hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now does that mean structure a little bit
like tighter node spacing, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the first flowering, all these
different ideas that people put in your
[SPEAKER_00]: head over the years of what's truth and
what's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but when it comes down to it,
you don't know how a male even works or
[SPEAKER_00]: breeds until you've run the seeds that
result from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know how that male breeds,
then how do you even know if it's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: male?
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these dudes just fucking smacking
males, fucking one boom, no testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: throw it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this shit's day.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the fuck do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even know how it breeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even know if that was the best
breeding male on the fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you guys got to keep that in
mind when buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jonathan Reed, are you talking about the
Reed family in, um, Massachusetts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you're referring to,
KB?
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's easier to separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also is a legit way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, like, if you, if you want to search
through a line, you want to see how a line
[SPEAKER_00]: breeds, sometimes using a known male and
crossing it to something completely
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite, or even just a known male,
like, you already know how male breeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to see how a female breeds,
use that known male, because you already
[SPEAKER_00]: know how it breeds to most stuff and you
can read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude's from Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to look that one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I'm not familiar with
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you suggest taking clones for males
also?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always take clones of my males.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the blue bonnet male is still
alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, JD.
[SPEAKER_00]: JD Short, I will say conclusively,
is one of the biggest twats in our
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, dude doesn't know shit about breeding
and he may make that obvious every time he
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking opens his mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he was very fortunate that his dad
made beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of his stuff takes beautiful
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he has made stuff that could be
considered good because his daddy did the
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: His daddy did the work in a fucking tent
with a one lighter, popping one seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and so here's another, here's another
thing about blueberry that makes it very
[SPEAKER_00]: unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when breeding, most people breed
towards certain traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people would never take two opposite
things, cross them, go through the next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation, take two opposite things,
cross them, go to the next generation,
[SPEAKER_00]: take two opposite things, cross them,
because you're just playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not, you're not, you're not
breeding in any direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what can come from that could be good,
but that's not, that's playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what DJ did in a one lighter in
a closet his whole career, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: until he got to Switzerland, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other people did the work there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I hate, I, you know, like I
respected DJ for so long until I talked to
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ, until I talked to DJ, DJ, I met DJ and
got to ask DJ some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suggest all of you, if you ever get
the chance, even if it's just writing a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder and seeing what the response is to
breeding questions, um, no, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: the answer before you message them,
that always helps because otherwise
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just going to shit in your ear and
you're going to believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So know the answer, but ask readers some
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how they respond to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they respond?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they give a fuck about breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: They give a fuck to answer your questions
or they just want your money, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, ask them, ask them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's, here's a perfect question to ask
any breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will tell you everything you need
to know about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask them, Hey, what from, what from your
line is the best for my Z like meaning my
[SPEAKER_00]: arthritis for my fucking hemorrhoids for
my my gut problems, my fucking my
[SPEAKER_00]: schizophrenia, ask them, whatever,
whatever, if they answer and they give you
[SPEAKER_00]: a line, they are just trying to sell you
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are just trying to sell you shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's no breeder on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: None, no breeder on earth that could ever
tell you what a specific Fino that the
[SPEAKER_00]: unpredictable specific Fino coming from a
seed pop is ever going to do to affect
[SPEAKER_00]: your individual brain chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can answer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they do, they don't know what the
fuck they're talking about or they're
[SPEAKER_00]: lying to you and just trying to sell you
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's, that's the one question
everybody should be asking every breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best for my arthritis?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best strain from you for my
arthritis and why, why is that the best
[SPEAKER_00]: strain for my arthritis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: JD's guys can suck a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really nice to that dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when I, um, no, you didn't district.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's asking much UFO questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a few, but, um, yeah, I was going to
say something about JD, but he's worthless
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't really fucking matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kicking them lots of props during
the blue bonnet thing because I felt bad
[SPEAKER_00]: because blueberry supposedly came from his
dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I am making one of the best
blueberry work on earth because of Lone
[SPEAKER_00]: Star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not because of me, not because of me,
but it is some of the best blueberry work
[SPEAKER_00]: on earth that was ever done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew it was going to take away from
some of his money pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I constantly plugged JD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to repost his shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does he do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking throw shade at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calls me all kinds of fucking names.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, I'm not going to be nice
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can go fuck themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: UFO, Zolar X is my favorite UFO band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zolar X was the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably too far back for me to
scroll and show you what Zolar X looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like, but they were the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I save any Zolar X pictures?
[SPEAKER_00]: For people that have been asking about
Darby and what's, what's become of him,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's Darby, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: My best blueberry work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, it depends, but it's going to be
from the blue bonnet stuff by far.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know about me, but he,
he, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inspector does good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do you know how to make, do you still,
I never made rainbow SSOG.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my boy, uh, small boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what he's doing with it
currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I know people enjoyed it quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoyed smoking it, but it's very,
OGKB dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, who's the biggest UFO charlatans in
the scene right now, in my opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dolan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hush woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I have to beat you and put you in
your cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Dolan is, is definitely up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, David Wilcock, anyone on Gaia,
anyone on Gaia, Steven Greer, Steven
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking Greer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy's a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Billy Meyer for some reason is still
around and that's sensitive subject for
[SPEAKER_00]: some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I was, I was tricked by Billy Meyer
when I was a little kid, but, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Michael Horn, who represents Billy
Meyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I did, it's endless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lou Elizondo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say fucking Lou Elizondo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy's a, uh, um, intelligence,
like counter intelligence expert and
[SPEAKER_00]: people jump on his dick like fucking
Richard Doty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, Greer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say Greer is at the top of the
charlatan parade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Mr. CE five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's, that's one of the better
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if people want something that will
sell at collectives, the GMO blue bonnet
[SPEAKER_00]: is an excellent one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you tell her to wait in the truck?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't tell her to wait in the
truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told her I'm going to put her in her
cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's how we do here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ain't that right, babe?
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can talk more shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: She ain't around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wilcock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: David Wilcock's a fucking idiot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the, he was the one who was saying
he, uh, it was Edgar Casey's
[SPEAKER_00]: reincarnation, which was silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, have you run any white
Buffalo?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't run any of the gear,
but I do know the white Buffalo guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to get anything from
Canada, I highly recommend them current
[SPEAKER_00]: guess on whether we've had non-human
intelligence or craft visiting pastor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of what I've studied my whole
existence, uh, knowing about UFOs is UFO
[SPEAKER_00]: crash retrievals and UFO crashes at the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't say at the end, but where I'm
currently at after years and years and
[SPEAKER_00]: years and years of that, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if we have meta
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we have anything from any
crash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's so much cloudy misinformation
put out by a select group of individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: and the same individual that's been
involved with it since the sixties via I E
[SPEAKER_00]: E E and S R I how put off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's magically been in the middle of
every single UFO, anything, any,
[SPEAKER_00]: any bad UFO event, someone from house crew
has been a part of, um, including Doty who
[SPEAKER_00]: is a part of house crew and the aviary,
which is another topic for another day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen proof for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen proof for any crashes,
any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people would turn to Lazar and
he's a fucking, unfortunately I,
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as I used to believe Lazar,
I've seen enough evidence now to know that
[SPEAKER_00]: he is, he's at least very dishonest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wilson Davis memos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of go with, um, Greenwald on this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenwald, shout out to Greenwald.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my boys, um, from the black
vault.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's done a great dissection of the
Wilson Davis memo.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done a great dissection on the,
um, uh, the document, NRO document that
[SPEAKER_00]: was faked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was proven to be fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my opinion, it's been proven to be
fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen enough, um, proof that it was a
fake to document.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what all the Wilson Davis memo
stuff is based on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that's fake, then, you know,
the Patreon is still going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon is definitely still going on a
breeder syndicate, Patreon join our
[SPEAKER_00]: discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think tomorrow's the fights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll, I'll be watching the fights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so join our discord if you're into any
of that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, we have a UFO section on the
discord too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really been using it lately
because I've been doing that elsewhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, yeah, uh, I intend to use it,
utilize it more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, we have a lot of fun there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, people talk directly to me,
not so, and all kinds of other folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best strawberry work I've ever seen was
from Cedar Berry farm strawberry cream,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was a, uh, a, a worked version of
strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Russia has crushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might have crashed UFOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might, but Russia was so locked down
and so hard to get info out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have books on specifically on Russian
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Jacques Fillet, I'm reading one by
Jacques Fillet again on, um, his Russian
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jacques Fillet, uh, if you haven't read
any Jacques Fillet stuff, he's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinating brain and mind in the UFO
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do I have any right here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't bring any with me over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I read like five or six books at a
time cause I have ADHD and I have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another one I'm revisiting John
Alexander, another aviary member.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, UFOs miss conspiracies and realities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's been, he's been deep in that,
that how I'll put off crew for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has very good insights to stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some other books that a lot
of people don't look at very often,
[SPEAKER_00]: but should be, uh, talked about in like
the William Corliss stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this one, he did a lot of stuff on the
mysterious universe, like so basically any
[SPEAKER_00]: anomalies, whether it's human,
ancient, uh, astronomical light anomalies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I highly recommend that stuff
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What region did your Afghani heirloom come
from?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came from a dude named Bite Me that
was on the Mr. Nice forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm guessing it's probably just a
super skunk hybrid of some sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably not a land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it would be an heirloom because it
was from the early nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be considered an heirloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a non-human, do you think the
smoke is black tech or have we,
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't we seen thoughts on Tic-Tac?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of my, one of my buddies was one of
the people who put eyes on Tic-Tac.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, I, I can't discount her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't discount her opinion on what she
saw at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think a lot of these anomalies are
drone tech, our own or otherwise,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't know on that specific one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you smoked the strawberry banana for
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you seeing me smoking some DNA shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have hardcore ADHD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abusive sent KKSC to replace a bunk
blowfish back around 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tastes like strawberry cream saver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find that from KKSC stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gave my grandma Havana syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been running the microwave all night
eating up hot pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking into the Havana
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some, some great old work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a book called Project
Camellia, not chameleon, but camellia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, it's, it's pretty fascinating
and, and it might have something to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Havana syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more about us using the tech on
civilians than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, ABC blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I will say, I will say, I will give a
hint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expect some mutant stuff to be coming out
in a collaboration soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever grow Lebanese hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I had a Lebanese, Lebanese Kush that I
grew that came from a collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a long gorilla arm type narrow leaf
dominant plant, but it finished in seven
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks and smoked super cushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the fucking weirdest shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super red hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it was pure Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if it was Lebanese to be
honest with you, but it did fit a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: those, um, a lot of the, the
classifications that, that Lebanese would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tic-tac going in and out of the water is
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, uh, Aguadilla Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any backgrounds on Caleb's chem one or the
haze he's crossed his stuff to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the chem one came from, um,
uh, Joe Brand's pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the original chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, the same pop that chem number
four came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very, very NL five haze dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, much more so than the chem four.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I don't get a lot of chem turps
from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy mercy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a 5% turpene content type plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly recommend it in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you keep males in your bedroom?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pluck the nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my bedroom is always at 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really have nut problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only time I ever see that is when I
don't repot quick enough with males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Males will almost always start throwing
nuts if they are feeling root restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you offer for that cush type
squat and crown tops?
[SPEAKER_00]: The beloved Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, um, Peaberry, which was the Katsu
bubba blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, like, uh, the white blue bonnet,
the white bonnet has, has tops like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, another kind of cushy, cushy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Louie has some females like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Louie, Louie, uh, bonnet aren't blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gary, I think we called it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see the great pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the great pie banana OG has some
beautiful tops like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chunky monkey had some beautiful tops
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Banana headband had some beautiful tops
like that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, that's, that's off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thoughts of PG&E being responsible for
huge wildfires year after year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my family worked for PG&E growing
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have very weird feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, PG&E has fucked me in the ass,
you know, so I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you, are your ABCs Caleb site for?
Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have ABCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not right now, not writing currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't released any, but expect
some soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fuck with my pension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chucky monkey was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did good, good grows on that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever get your original right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cut back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anybody who has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't never seen it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no.
[SPEAKER_00]: As, as tragic as that is that died with
Mooney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, where can I see pictures of Blubba
Kush?
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is a lot of my hashtags
have been fucking snuffed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little hard to search,
but it's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's plenty of pictures of it
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think Lawler is going to smoke
Diaz?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, nobody could convince me
otherwise unless it just happens like,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if he catches Lawler in a fucking
submission, which is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Diaz is fucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be very hard to see Diaz winning
that fight, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, showing up, needing to bump up a
weight class so he doesn't have to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: pay cut, all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some fucking shenanigans right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some shenanigans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people would have to take a
fucking pay cut, not Diaz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to move the fucking weight
class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Robbie's just a bad ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel, I feel, bad for him that he keeps
bad people around him that, that let him
[SPEAKER_00]: stay in that fucking horrible head space
that he's in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do feel bad for Diaz on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, where are we at?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're over an hour in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I got to mention what's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if, if you're part of the Patreon,
there's a backstage part of the site where
[SPEAKER_00]: you have access to stuff for sale that no
one else does yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always get first shot at some stuff
and the rarest stuff and the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's only a few packs left of things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now in the backstage, there is the,
um, the chem sis S one crossed a blue
[SPEAKER_00]: bonnet, which is the dead ringer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called it, um, or the person who had
the cut forever and tried to push it as
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D called it, but it was the chem sis
S one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Cokehead slut in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we have the blue baby shit 2.0 that I
mentioned earlier in the back,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the blue moonshine cross and the
unicorn Skittles, which is a collab
[SPEAKER_00]: between me and Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's in the backstage right now to be
bought, but you can only get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have Patreon, if you don't,
then you have to wait, uh, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: how long or when they're going to go
upfront, but they will be eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: upfront.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have any strains of being released that
dump in hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole bonnet line was made to be a
hash dumper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, pretty much anyone who's,
who's working lines now breeds for hash
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's just such a major part of
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my recommendations on strains that
dump hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it just, I would first ask,
what, what are your, some of your favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: strains to smoke that you like,
um, that you like to wash?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would pick one based on that
because there's so many different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've been pretty, for,
for hash strands long before bonnet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, I think bonnet's been the most
consistently awesome for washing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the GMO bonnet would be a quick
pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Berry has been fucking awesome for
washing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the white bonnet, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the trademark Chad's been fucking
surprisingly awesome, but that's because
[SPEAKER_00]: it has a lot of turpentine qualities to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My last auctions didn't go so smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think JJ is going to stop
back crossing the diesel to F3?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would that be the benefits of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't, I don't, I mean,
I've never asked him why he's done the
[SPEAKER_00]: back crosses he's done or what,
what was his purpose or what his breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: direction was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys didn't have to ask him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sunshine daydream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one germ, one out of one from a 13
pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cherry bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cherry bears an awesome fucking washer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cherry AK period was a fucking
awesome washer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any strains available with
menthol terps?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would most people when they say menthol
are referring to turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the trademark Chad has that in spades.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to pop some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else would have that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The super dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, uh, we have some, what was that
called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Electric field blue bonnet that had,
it looked like OGKB, but it smelled like a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking menthol cigarette.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like the filter of a menthol
cigarette, which is mostly turbiniline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trademark Chad was the Durbin blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether turps on bonnet like blueberry
berry as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's blueberry candy, blueberry
muffins all throughout how it braids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what you cross it to,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most heavy dominant blueberry
breeding line I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: How OGKB dom is boysenberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: OGKB tends to dominate almost any cross
it's in and it, um, that mutation is very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very heavy breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: True breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavy breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to smoke your bloompas headband grown
by a garden in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad someone's tearing it up over
there with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful pictures coming out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bloompas headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Favorite liner cut from Bodhi that you've
tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got quite a collection from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, my favorite Bodhi one of all time was
I think one of the first lines I ever ran
[SPEAKER_00]: from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's got so many amazing ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Afgui double purple Doja still stands
at the top of my favorite from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt anybody has any seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's so old, but he's kept,
he's been good about keeping his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I loved that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, I love the smell of Afgui.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like blueberry melon turps and with
the yield of the double purple Doja and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the purple color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just fucking bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Land Race Durbin is going to
definitely dominate the OGKB.
[SPEAKER_00]: Land races and things like Durbin tend to
dominate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, yeah, I could see that
not having a single OGKB type plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Midnight Cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a string called Midnight Cowboy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Menopurps and Wookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that movie and song.
[SPEAKER_00]: The theme song from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the first songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think actually in Abandoned Kill we used
to play that song in the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any idea of the lineage of mass super
skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, depends on which one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, first one I couldn't tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second one is super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would anybody except a Sunshine
Daydream male or female for breeding hit
[SPEAKER_00]: me up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one going Doja from, I don't know
what Melvin is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what strains would you give,
say give you the red eye shotgun hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: type smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, dude, everybody, everybody's
brain chemistry is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't tell you what would hit you
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, headband tends to hit a lot of people
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the banana headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a great one if, if,
if OG types tend to hit you like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think, I think we have the,
a few packs left of the, the Blackberry
[SPEAKER_00]: Cream, um, Blackberry Cream Banana OG,
which normally Blackberry Kushy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but it did well with the Banana
OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful, beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, excellent breeder for, for purples
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some of those up on the site too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, the Sour Apple Platinum Banana
OG, we let some of those out as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Land Race Durvins are going to be heavy,
heavy dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one of those things to penaline
breeds dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Popping the pale strangler soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pale strangler.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if it bothers you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, are you guys bothered by this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this bother you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you even hear it when I do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no one said a word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Offering from Mel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you mean Mel Van, that old fucking
raggedy old bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another person like two currants
fucking after her first grow of six
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: First grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: She made seeds and fucking started selling
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam Mim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bitch looks like Madam Mim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I have nothing good to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: About that woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I advocate for women in cannabis
because there's so, it is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: testosterone dominant thing, but I don't
advocate for idiots in cannabis.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's from Ohio, but nobody in Ohio has
ever fucking heard of her odd,
[SPEAKER_00]: but she's this legit old fucking breeder
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when she showed up on C Depot
and she's fucking damn lucky C Depot
[SPEAKER_00]: forums down where I would make a fucking
joke out of her ass quick, quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like got some seeds from my boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodie and fucking immediately,
immediately make seeds on her first grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and sells them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buckeye purple is mega boof.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, I can't even explain to people how
boof it is, how crazily boof it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody listened to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody listened to me on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wanted to fucking get their
hands on that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was something new, even though you
could get any blackberry or any Mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: perp's hybrid, it would look like that and
be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, people are at all different points
of their cannabis learning experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could the fellowship have taken the Eagles
halfway to Mordor?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a Lord of the Rings guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also don't like Star Wars and I don't
like Star Trek.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know people are going to cancel me
for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't, I never got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I liked the first Star Wars when I
was little.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked, I liked Ewoks, which is not very
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was a kid, so that's about it.
What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking shit over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flanville is going to unsub it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't talk shit about the wars or the
Trek.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the Avengers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I liked comic books when I was
little, but I just never really cared much
[SPEAKER_00]: about it after.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do like UFOs, so I'm still a fucking
dork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not watching AEW.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a lot of old wrestling and like
80s, 70s, early, early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't paid much attention to AEW,
but I do think it's good that it's shaking
[SPEAKER_00]: shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you ever see the Ewok movie?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: See Brynn just said the same thing,
that I look like an Ewok.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she called me a kindred spirit to a
fucking Ewok.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cute, short, fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I haven't checked out Ewok stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I eventually will go back and
watch Star Wars, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had friends that were such like
extreme Star Wars dorks that I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck you, I'm never watching that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I do watch Dark Side of the
Ring, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like those Vice documentaries on
wrestling.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been some great ones talking
about a lot of the stuff that hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really been talked about much outside of
books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And podcasts, obviously talk about some of
like the Bruiser Brody stuff and shoot
[SPEAKER_00]: interviews and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, Dark Side of the Ring has been
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: X-Files best show ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a major X-Files nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have the original X-Files box set
from the very, when they finished the very
[SPEAKER_00]: last season, right there in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll never get rid of it, even though
it's DVDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take on Bill Cooper?
[SPEAKER_00]: He exposed a lot of these UFO researchers
long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Cooper was busy selling out the UFO
community while doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was working closely with Doty and other
intelligence fools, selling out people in
[SPEAKER_00]: the community in trade for getting real
info, which he got none of.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a very controversial polarizing type
character in the UFO community.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I think he's been gone long
enough that it would be very interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I would love to talk to Bill Moore
now and see where his head's at with
[SPEAKER_00]: everything after having, you know,
a good 20 years out of the community to
[SPEAKER_00]: sit and ponder on how everything went
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you shed light on informants in the
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I don't know who's actual
informants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there have been people that put
down paperwork threatening to inform.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about them a lot since I was
involved in some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actual informants, nobody knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who they'd be or they wouldn't be
breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might sound basic, but over time,
some of my favorite strains for that
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy, like daisy high was Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, special cut, some old heads
grew back East.
[SPEAKER_00]: GG4, grease monkey headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what grease monkey is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like some new dog seed shit,
but GG4 headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you like a chemi-OG type
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I believe Big Lazar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Lazar?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen enough stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to not believe Bob Lazar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does break my heart because he was one
of my favorite people to listen to and
[SPEAKER_00]: ponder on when I was a young kid,
up until I was an adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been enough stuff put out ever
since Jeremy Corbel started sniffing up
[SPEAKER_00]: his asshole that I'm pretty sure he
hoaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty sure he hoaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know, I mean, yeah, I could talk
about, you know, when you're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: informants, of course, everybody's going
to bring up RezDog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waiting for someone to put out some,
the full info on that before I can speak
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck is a Tina?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck is a Tina?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exotic Mike doesn't even make seeds
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That motherfucker's been white labeling
for I don't know how long.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, he got rid of his best friend who
would not white label for him,
[SPEAKER_00]: who would not sell him white label seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good luck with all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not even working shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude doesn't even, that dude,
that dude, I could go on forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell believed him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corbel does believe Bob Lazar and Corbel
is a fucking shill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corbel was a part of a deathbed CIA
interview confession that was proven to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a hundred percent false.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he still, still lies about it to this
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets called out about it daily,
daily, and still will not fucking budge.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that he has the DD-214 to prove
that this guy was in the CIA.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave a fake name for the dude
originally, which I mean, some people like
[SPEAKER_00]: to hide their identities, but they were
doing a CIA deathbed confession.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all real.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy's real name was Dick P Manlove.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even fucking kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude's name is Dick P Manlove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go, go look up, go online and look up
Dick P Manlove.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a obituary for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the fake CIA confession guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy never worked for the CIA.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a grocery checkout dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Richard Dolan, Jeremy Corbel,
Linda Moulton Howe, all vouched for that
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they won't take it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the scoop on big stimmy drop in new
cases of, I don't even, what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dominion packs are hard to get now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit, some skunk one packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck out of here with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Motherfucker didn't even make those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: His ex-girlfriend made those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you didn't know that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you think Lazar lied?
[SPEAKER_00]: He gained nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gained a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gained a lot financially and they've
presented it as if he's gained nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tester's corporation paid him big.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's licensed his movie deal twice and
made millions on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's sold countless merchandise from his
own store that he makes money off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corbel says he didn't make any money off
the documentary, but Corbel made a
[SPEAKER_00]: shitload of money off that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you bet, you bet, you bet Bob made
that money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing that a lot of people don't
know, and this is public now, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see it, after Bob Lazar got kind of shaken
up by his whole fucking UFO fraud shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: he started running a whorehouse with a
madam, which I ain't judging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ain't fucking judging on, you know,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing I would judge on is the fact
that he got caught installing fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: video cameras in the room to blackmail the
Johns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the type of guy the type of person that
would do stuff like that, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, he didn't, he didn't, he made that
money back in the 90s with the Tester's,
[SPEAKER_00]: or early 2000s, late 90s with the Tester's
corporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The movie license deals, those were very
early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is nothing recent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a long fucking con job, long ass con
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a great liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna lie, dude, Bob Lazar's a
great liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sold me for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between CIA and the hippie mafia.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a book out called Chaos that's
about Charles Manson and the MK Ultra
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fascinating, really
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is my favorite Bubba cut that's still
possible, that is possible to get still?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite Bubba cut, Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is very believable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had me sold for till the last year and
a half or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I started really, and the
reason I didn't like looking into Bob
[SPEAKER_00]: Lazar, I did not want to find out he was a
liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not want to find out that
motherfucker lied.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had believed him since I was in my
teens, early teens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I found out he was a liar,
when I started looking into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking into it to prove he wasn't a
liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was a fucking liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has lied about so many things that have
to do with that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that there was someone that
worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, let me bring it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is not lying about working at Area 51.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is lying about working at S4.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is lying about that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: He fixed the radiation badge detectors and
would scan them at Area 51.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we know he actually did there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did not do any reverse engineering,
no propulsion, nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was heartbreaking to learn that
about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm very passionate about UFO
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you have seeds of Bubba?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did a Bubba Kush BX1 that I sold
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used the heirloom Afghani to BX to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Blubba Kush, which is the blue bonnet
Bubba Kush, still is super, super,
[SPEAKER_00]: super cushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some berry turps in it,
but for the most part, Bubba dominates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are available too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The G13 has been dead forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Airborne G13, which is G13NL2,
very hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have lied about using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else you guys got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we dying down?
[SPEAKER_00]: 86 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this was going to be a short
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drank coffee so I'd have some energies.
[SPEAKER_00]: AK-47 worth growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if it's real AK-47, I would say so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some beautiful AK phenos and
great breeding ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba is bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba is one of those desert island
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had five to choose, Bubba would be in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob's UFO hookers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vision!
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is heirloom different than land race
genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Land race implies that it has not been
worked by man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heirloom implies that it's been worked by
man, but it's been around long enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: be considered heirloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But land race is in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it is grown, where it naturally
forms, so there's no such thing as a North
[SPEAKER_00]: American land race, no such thing as a
South American land race, but there are
[SPEAKER_00]: heirloom lines from South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are heirloom hemp lines in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's been long enough to call
certain lines like Super Skunk that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been here since 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a long time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is heirloom status.
[SPEAKER_00]: But land race is a whole different term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the Bubba Cut that we had in San
Diego is fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that we always call Pre-98.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that is the same cut as
the Bubba like the CSI uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had them in the same room at the same
time, and they grow very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba is one of those things that breed so
true, and it's very hard to tell if one's
[SPEAKER_00]: a hybrid of the other, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Cherry AK branchy?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make it branchy, but just thinking
about it right now, it's not terribly
[SPEAKER_00]: branchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has great structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still find Ancient Aliens a great TV
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many facts about Ancient Astronauts
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't watch Ancient Aliens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get too mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my friends are on it, on Ancient
Aliens, and we all give them shit for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there has been decent, true stuff
talked about on Ancient Aliens,
[SPEAKER_00]: but between David Hatcher Childress,
Jason Martel, fucking Giorgio Sokolos,
[SPEAKER_00]: those guys are so full of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: David Wilcock, one of the most full of
shit motherfuckers ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corey Good, all those dudes, all bad,
all bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to watch a full episode to
maybe get two minutes of real content or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that's remotely factual.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you smoke and watch it,
it's pretty fun, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: CSI is 707, he told me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I know of Katsu and Pre-98.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the original cut from Shaw would be
Pre-98.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was another cut, I think,
in Sokol, that was also passed around as
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-98.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaw's Bubba is the Bubba Kush though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they might be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be the same as the Pre-98 cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one of those things with
microclimates and climates and how things
[SPEAKER_00]: change and how things express.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are so similar, it's very hard to
know if the Sokol Pre-98 and Shaw's Bubba
[SPEAKER_00]: are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Katsu, Katsu's a fucking joke of a human
being.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I mean, he's a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with that said, nice guys make bad
decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he bothered the fuck out of me
and blew up my phone to get cuts when he
[SPEAKER_00]: first started to want to come back and
grow, because he hadn't been growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wanted to start his first breeding
projects because he said he could make
[SPEAKER_00]: money off his name because people think he
was a breeder because he passed cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I was like, oh, this guy's a
shit bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you call exploiting a
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is happy to have people believe he
was a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was not a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He passed cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He bought expensive seeds and passed a cut
and left the community not long
[SPEAKER_00]: thereafter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to be a dick about it, but it's
just, I have no edit button, so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just what's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I fucking say?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did give him a cut though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did give him map one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not a breeder, but now he says
he is and people will sell his shit like
[SPEAKER_00]: he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was trying to have everyone make
the seeds for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about that, about ghost
giving him his bubacay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't around back then, so I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you had anybody find some skunky
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are using it in their
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have renamed it to use it
in their lines, but not a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: can afford it in his way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you ever have Bodhi on the
syndicate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been wanting to work with Bodhi
specifically on the Nepalese area and the
[SPEAKER_00]: hippie hash trail, but that dude's so busy
and he has a family life, so I don't like
[SPEAKER_00]: to push him about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's cherry Kush?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be any number of fucking a thousand
things someone called cherry Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a cut called cherry OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of boofy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A breeder like the drunkers, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, people are breeders like the
drunkers now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not ever going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but in reality, I'm not much of a
breeder anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't work lines anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't worked, like steadily worked a
line to like fucking past F3, F4,
[SPEAKER_00]: BX tier three in a decade maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's been a long time, so I can't
even call myself a breeder, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm not anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be homeless.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's good about Trinity?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Trinity that's out there,
we don't have any kind of verification or
[SPEAKER_00]: validation on from the old Trinity crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, technically the Trinity cut we
all use as an imposter, but we try to be
[SPEAKER_00]: very clear about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canivore says, Katsu bought his bubble cut
from the green crack man in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supposedly comes from Oregon kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you still doing Skittles work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, did it early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my favorite breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not bad, but it's not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was less consistent than I would have
liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homeless man, hey, hey, getting close
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of smoke and mirrors when it
comes to breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think that people make a
lot of money off seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just never been true.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few guys who make a lot of money
off seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ain't ever been one.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my friends are not them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them like to front.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna talk to my friends,
but other people like to front like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of money in seeds because
they do that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like fake it till you make it,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like nobody's making a shit load of money
off seeds anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are fucking running clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not pushing all FEM seeds,
all fucking gelato hybrids, you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: making money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I could go give out free seeds out
in front of my house, give everybody my
[SPEAKER_00]: address and have fucking people lined up
past the fucking Bakersfield entrance,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it doesn't mean that they're gonna buy
shit, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't had fires here, but the whole
outside right now looks like an alien sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our sun is completely bright neon pink
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Skittles worth running?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's worth running if you haven't
run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up with two crits?
[SPEAKER_00]: I helped him buy gifts for his kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy's a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used our crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used our crew for our shit,
made promises, to get shit that he
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't have had access to, and then
sold it and then called us liars.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fucking noob of a little fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little, worthless little fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, don't do nice things for that
kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done really bad shit to really good
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he hasn't even been around that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's gonna pay for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot wait to see that kid post-COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna trash can him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna beat him up or anything
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna trash can him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and him and I still need to trash can
fucking little Artie.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Roundtable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promised that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get that one and you'll get two
currents in a trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get two turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get two currents in a trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna fucking give him a power
wedgie too when I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't believe a word out of two
currents mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a word.
[SPEAKER_00]: All he does is lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't necessarily steal my stuff,
but he did go to Breeders Direct Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get a line that me and High and
Lonesome made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long before it was supposed to be
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before it was tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders Direct Seed Co gave that little
fuck the seeds without anyone's
[SPEAKER_00]: permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they told, after they found out,
they're like, don't use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So immediately made crosses with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did the same thing to High and
Lonesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used the fucking, the pity fucking,
the pity shit to get some Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Promised he'd never fucking do anything
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't sell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Immediately started selling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then called High and Lonesome a fucking
liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we caught him red handed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red handed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red handed doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's like, to us, he's like,
well, I only sold 10 packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't really fucking matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, bro, you're breaking your
word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turns out it was a lot more than 10 packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nonetheless, a liar's a liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and High and Lonesome did the dirty
dancing together, which was the,
[SPEAKER_00]: his, a dirty, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dirty dancing, dog swalts, the poodle nuts
cut, crossed a blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't work with Smoboat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never really worked with him,
but we were good friends and I let him
[SPEAKER_00]: sell some of his stuff through the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got all the money from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we didn't really work together,
but I tried to give him a big push,
[SPEAKER_00]: as big a push as I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what friends do for each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dude, I wouldn't tent, tent float.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I'm not going to say a dude
didn't have cancer because that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no proof whether he did or didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that he's a liar and lied about
other things in life, but I wouldn't say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't insinuate that he didn't have,
I have no fucking clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, too bad if he did have cancer that he
didn't fucking croak, but I will say that
[SPEAKER_00]: cause he's a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, history of grape ape or lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back to you on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come back to the next live feed and I'll
ask someone who would actually know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that, um, Brett Bogue was selling
grape ape seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Kyle Cushman, um, had claim on
grape ape for a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an, uh, an Urkel hybrid of sorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is blue bonnet available?
Pure?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to ask speakeasy if they still
have blue bonnet, um, seeds available.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did sell F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does who really have a Chem 91 from Caleb?
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb never gave Two Currents shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't even know him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CSI, I've never referred to a CSI to
be polite, but, um, no, Two Currents never
[SPEAKER_00]: got anything from fucking CSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in a million fucking years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, CSI wouldn't know him if he saw him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He probably never heard his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did let, um, little shit head come to a
party where, where CSI was at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, they didn't speak to each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, no, he's a little liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you, the dude's a fucking
liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not making it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just mad at the kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, I'm mad at him because he's a liar and
he, he just, he said they were homies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and CSI are homies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure CSI will love to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the foulest, funkiest blueberry
crush you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right now, the funkiest would
definitely be the blue baby shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it has the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The collab with Loompa you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: The raspberry headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any info on what to look for in the pack?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, calling that a collab was a stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called a collab because I wanted to
give Loompa some money, but in order to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that, to sell through his people,
he had to have his name on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, with that said, there's a lot of day
record type stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of Chem 91 type of stuff,
and there's a lot of OG type stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all over the place with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thoughts on Mr. Bob Hemphill?
[SPEAKER_00]: He calls himself the librarian dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my friends like him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people know he's full of shit,
but a lot of them say he's harmless.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, if you're selling fucking
lines that are fake and you don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are what you say they are,
you're kind of a shit bag, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're presenting yourself as a librarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all I got to say about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he was a shit bag to one of my best
friends, probably one of the nicest people
[SPEAKER_00]: I know in Mad Elite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I do not and will not ever have
anything good to say about Bob Hemphill.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just not, like I've watched him do
shit bag things.
[SPEAKER_00]: He traded a bunch of cuts he had that he
wasn't supposed to fucking trade to a
[SPEAKER_00]: little fraud named Nature Farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're in any of these old
circles, you only get in those old circles
[SPEAKER_00]: with those old cuts because people trust
you enough to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you disrespect that, you are
pushed out of the circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think the cannabis community should
create a jockey club to protect breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: and the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't Skunk Tech, I gave Skunk Tech Day
Wrecker, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he still has it,
but yeah, I gave it to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says he has original diesel from
someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I did give him the original diesel
Day Wrecker cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he considers the other
original diesel more real than the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: one, but who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the guy's a fucking squid,
so take it for what it's worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of squids in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the industry and you interact
with a lot of people, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: interact with a lot of squids.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people that are not, um,
decent human beings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the Day Wrecker is still in the
circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day Wrecker is still in the circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Blue Wrecker, which is the Day
Wrecker Blue Bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a very good regular seed version
of the Day Wrecker because Blue Bonnet
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't impart many blueberry traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really mostly imparts heavier resin
production, um, better structure and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, shorter flowering, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's going to say anything bad about
CSI or Skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude's as legit as they come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, CSI, I'm biased.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my best friends on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I couldn't say anything bad about him,
but even if, even if he wasn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: even, even when we weren't friendly,
I still had nothing bad to say about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always looked up to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone says something bad about Bodhi,
there's something wrong with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if someone says something bad about
me, probably true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, probably not the whole truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was probably way meaner than they say,
but if they say I'm a liar or a thief,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they say I'm an asshole, probably true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably said something real mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk VA is a great dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been cool to me when he never had to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Mountain, take some pics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you liking them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what are the Terps liking that you
found in your, uh, blue records?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, with that said, got to remember this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just one perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never take anything I say for fucking a
hundred percent true because truth lies in
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so to do some investigating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like make sure that what I'm
saying is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not always right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but if I'm saying it, I at least have
done the research and think I'm right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: CSI is a wealth of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of, a lot of stuff that,
that I know has been passed down by people
[SPEAKER_00]: like him or him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you just look at me like a
regurgitator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not that smart myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: One blue bonnet Dom out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, yeah, it's not, it's not super
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The berry, the berry is not super dominant
in the blue record, but, um, it is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: day record.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your regular seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get a good one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so amazingly full of fucking
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know that there's anyone that
knows the Dutch seed bank era better than
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it would be, I would be hard pressed
to find someone, even the guys who were
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's what passion does, you know,
and Oklahoma, um, gray skull for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some pics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see him brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, is the chem 91 this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I has the skunk V a one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one chem 91 that should ever
be considered scum 90, uh, chem dog 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the skunk V a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best haze or sativa linear best sativa
linear is going to be the trademark Chad
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, out of what's currently available,
I did a lot of, of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, broad leaf work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas prior, almost everything I was
doing was, uh, narrow leaf dominance,
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa dominant done at 50 days,
dude, an original, I guess it's not an
[SPEAKER_00]: original diesel Fino.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like having original diesel
come down at 50 days, but that's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of, one of the highlights of
blueberry is how far down it can bring,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, flowering times.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some great GMO dominant looking,
smelling plants in the GMO blue bonnet
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That come down way, way faster than GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, get gene on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I've asked him to, we've talked about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't done it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of heart division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, watermelon turps seem to vanish after
curing thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just some of those turps that don't
really hang.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually if you have watermelon stuff,
it's not a strong watermelon smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually watermelon and something
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas AF GUI is the closest to pure
melon turps that I can find that that
[SPEAKER_00]: stick around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it's been like a fucking over a
hundred minutes have been here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I guess we'll do this again
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to keep doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I got to go over this,
do some housekeeping before we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, right now, uh, you can go by banana
headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the black bananas, which is,
uh, the blackberry cream platinum banana
[SPEAKER_00]: OG, uh, grape pie platinum and OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew what I was going to talk about
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put those up in the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour apple platinum banana OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, get the Patreon, you get discounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you join the riot site,
the shop, you get an automatic $10 in your
[SPEAKER_00]: account to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we take all forms of Bitcoin and
credit card again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Credit card is back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have talked to breeder Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to have him on sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for showing up.
Okay.
