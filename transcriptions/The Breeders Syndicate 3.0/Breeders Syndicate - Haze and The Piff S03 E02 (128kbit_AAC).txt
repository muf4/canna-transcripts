[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, how's everyone doing I'm still sick
from last week, so I'm gonna do my best to
[SPEAKER_02]: trooper on through it I Checked this this
is fucking great.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is fucking great Like a few years ago
and I didn't think about it Oh shit shit
[SPEAKER_02]: little G's last ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: How fucking cool is that gonna be?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that body?
[SPEAKER_00]: How goes it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I found this pack and I was like,
oh my god, there's a shitload of G's last
[SPEAKER_02]: ones in here But then I remember these are
the fake display seeds that I used to put
[SPEAKER_02]: on the counter at Emerald Cup So snag them
they wouldn't get anything Damn Got by
[SPEAKER_00]: myself You know, like I can't tell you how
much it makes me sad sometimes when I find
[SPEAKER_00]: old seeds Yeah, and then none of them pop
Yeah, it goes from like hope and
[SPEAKER_00]: excitement and joy to like worry to like
oh man Yeah, and you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got this in and I'm gonna show it
off cuz it's our buddies This is this is
[SPEAKER_02]: seriously a nice fucking presentation like
the terpene kits from crybaby Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is I mean, that's nice dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like bro fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Mean, it'll be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a plan to have him on to talk turf
I know I just wanted to show it off for
[SPEAKER_02]: him so people can see before we do the
episode It's pretty professional.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's All kinds of cards in here that
just did describe everything it tells you
[SPEAKER_00]: how to go through it lots of tips and
tricks What's interesting about it is like
[SPEAKER_00]: they You know, they have those kind of
things for perfumes and like yeah I had
[SPEAKER_00]: some friends that were studying because I
live in wine country, right like studying
[SPEAKER_00]: to be so many days Yeah, and in order to
do that back then like this is like 18
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago or something They would buy
these like thousand dollar kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then Romans were there to teach
them Like what an advanced taster was
[SPEAKER_00]: tasting or smelling when they like,
you know We're talking about Merlot or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever and they were talking about
woodsy notes with hints of raspberry and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that they had to be able to like learn
the language and so they had like a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: book and all these scents and all this
different stuff and so for terpenes with
[SPEAKER_00]: weed it's like Teaching people how to talk
about smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a big part It's a big thing
if you can if you can do it, too And it's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably like most breeders and weed nerds
biggest week week area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know it is for me I'm not I'm not
a turp expert by any stretch of the
[SPEAKER_00]: imagination No, definitely not neither am
I you know, and neither are a lot of our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends Yeah, you know, so I mean there's
an aspect where it's like it's just you
[SPEAKER_00]: just lack the language because you don't
encounter how to talk about that language
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Turpines and like wine sommeliers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about using your eyebrows and
like and your eyes to express mmm Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I mean it It's and then it's
okay and then it's all relative to that
[SPEAKER_02]: human beings ability to taste Yeah,
I have I have a really bad sense of smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my taste is really off too You know,
like the whole the whole shebang sucks
[SPEAKER_02]: Upstairs here and then This region right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah the whole everything everything in
this region is sucking We're slowly
[SPEAKER_02]: climbing up there Yeah, yeah, it's weird
when I have to do it on this fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: account Like most people don't know to
follow it even though I said it so are you
still?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shadow band or whatever on the other one
from doing like I checked it this morning
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was like nope You cannot do lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is what it is I'm used to it by now But
yeah, no people should we're gonna do a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole episode I'm not exactly sure when
but we're gonna have our our buddy crybaby
[SPEAKER_00]: on and he has a lot of knowledge and
language around aromas turpines sense what
[SPEAKER_00]: causes smells what are the components of
it and He'll be able to speak a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligently than either Matt or I can
yeah, I think you know, so That'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope he was the one that Was first
telling me to stop calling skunky shit
[SPEAKER_02]: turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like oops Yeah, they're like the
alls and like yeah, but what's interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: about that is even like the more like
rambling for a while waiting for people to
[SPEAKER_00]: show up, but even What's interesting about
you know, the thing about the alls and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff is how they're volatile Yeah,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah turpines are longer lasting and I
would always notice about the old super
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk that I had That the last two or
three weeks before harvest and the first
[SPEAKER_00]: month after cutting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just rank Yeah, but if you kept it
long enough, even if and you know in a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice jar in the dark or whatever It would
eventually just kind of turn into generic
[SPEAKER_00]: green, but did you find that the more it
kept its moisture content?
[SPEAKER_02]: The longer it lasted in them as it oh,
yeah, certainly Yeah, it was actually kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of tough because it was one of those nugs
that you were like It was famous for like
[SPEAKER_00]: looking dense but weighing light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, you put this thing that you
think was like a huge nug and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh man This thing's a massive and it's
like two point eight grams Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know just it had like but it had
really good like air to air to bud ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it burned really well Yeah,
very very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use snappers of it Some bud like
like cushions especially and a lot of this
[SPEAKER_00]: cookie shit You really have to cure it
right to get it to burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, you know, but but You know
super skunk you could burn that like
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it just had like a good amount of
air It sounds like Denali saved that cut
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm real stoked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're up over it We're hundred and
eight hundred and ten people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we could start chatting Yeah,
do you want to answer a few questions
[SPEAKER_02]: first and then maybe it'll get up higher a
little bit Yeah, I haven't even fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: looked to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been bullshitting Someone just
asked about mango haze I could talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: mango haze Mango mango haze is like a
super nice line from Shanti Baba and
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville It's a nl5 haze by skunk haze It's
a sister to super silver haze and it uses
[SPEAKER_00]: this famous cut called the 122 or the
mango Which is like my favorite nl5 haze
[SPEAKER_00]: cut and it's still alive over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's still Sholden coffee shops
and Shanti has it apparently Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, it's it's a little bit more
hazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little it's a little like it's got
a little bit more of the flavors that I
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's got less turpentine than super
silver haze It doesn't tend to yield as
[SPEAKER_00]: much But but it's a super nice plant and I
think it's likely one of the ones where he
[SPEAKER_00]: still has the right parents Yeah,
I can't say for nobody can say for sure
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think people still find really nice
plants in that line Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just a there is a clone only
mango haze, too I believe I don't know if
[SPEAKER_02]: it's from the same seed line But I know
Miami mango has that one and it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like a turpentine and mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's one of my favorites It's
like I've seen some tests on it and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty off the charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah pretty high and Yeah, so that's mango
haze It's kind of mango haze and super
[SPEAKER_00]: silver and Neville's haze are kind of like
the final three hazes that came out Yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of like one whole era,
you know so that's starting at the end not
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning but You know, let's see
Skunk haze a lot of people in Europe don't
[SPEAKER_00]: like the skunk hazes quite as much because
they felt the skunk aspects kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: overpowered the The haze like the more
delicate haze aspects that they liked
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they were always kind of
looking for like bland Indica's to cross
[SPEAKER_00]: it to yeah To allow, you know,
they kind of wanted like very little turf
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts Yeah, blend it to to see if the haze
turps would come through so Anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know we were gonna we're gonna
chat about haze tonight, which is a super
[SPEAKER_00]: controversial subject So a disclaimer,
this is just kind of like our opinion on
[SPEAKER_00]: it and like what we see Yeah in the forum
days when things got started some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: longest running threads ever were
arguments between all these old-timers
[SPEAKER_00]: over haze On cannabis world on overgrow
probably On IC mag it would just go
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes it would go into the hundreds of
pages Yeah of people battling back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth over.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the real haze story?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like one of my good friends over on
mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice did probably what I think was the
best Treatise on haze like overview on
[SPEAKER_02]: haze during that time before any anybody
else had really been able to track down
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone to talk to my friend bigger Off mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see there's someone with that name in
here, but I don't think it's the same dude
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be awesome if I remember him on
mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice for sure herb was a cool dude I
haven't seen him in a long time though So
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if he's still hanging around
or what the deal is But if you I think
[SPEAKER_02]: it's still up on mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice and for the most part I know it's
been considered one of the more accurate
[SPEAKER_02]: histories on it But there was some stuff
we dug up in the past few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Bodhi found a book about Santa Cruz
or written in Santa Cruz and Santa Cruz
[SPEAKER_02]: history and it actually mentions a few of
them by name and it's one of the first
[SPEAKER_02]: things we Found where there were other
names in it, you know full names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm I mean, so there's an aspect where
like You know haze has a history dating
[SPEAKER_00]: back to like the late 60s early 70s Yeah,
so it's hard enough to decipher stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: happened 15 or 20 years ago much less 40
so there's a lot of Forgive me hazy stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: around the origins of it and on Those
threads there's tons of arguing that's
[SPEAKER_00]: gone on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's tons of arguing and there's
you know Sam skunk man has his version and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he's posted under different
names about things He claims to have been
[SPEAKER_00]: a neighbor to those guys But I think
what's fairly well accepted is it started
[SPEAKER_00]: out as Colombian by Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I Think we could start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Colombian by Colombian From import
weed and they grew it in greenhouses In
[SPEAKER_00]: Santa Cruz and areas that were mild like
that Because you needed those mild
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures in order to take it till
December or January or whatever the hell
[SPEAKER_00]: it was that they pulled it down Yeah,
they hadn't figured out depths or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it got pretty famous I don't Matt
has a poster somewhere of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got early on got named and got kind of
legendary You know, it was sold high-end
[SPEAKER_00]: in New York, I believe For you know quite
a bit at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was considered like the super
kind of sewer weed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say all this is pretty like
standard and not argued about that much
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that much that much it's it's
considered to be correct I think that that
[SPEAKER_00]: much is considered once you get into like
who's Responsible for what and what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened when and how and all that that's
where it gets kind of dicey Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: but basically what seems like and there's
a lot of stuff where you read online where
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll talk about Like it's a Colombian by
Indian by Thai by Mexican You know Sam
[SPEAKER_00]: swears that it's colo by colo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah you know and all that stuff was added
way later and Isn't really part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he said the Indian was added way
later if at all I don't remember was that
[SPEAKER_00]: his claim or not I think he said that the
Indian was in there but it was like it was
[SPEAKER_00]: added as a separate hybrids he offered and
never got mixed In with the you know with
[SPEAKER_00]: the core with the core amount of hate so
we always had separate haze Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you know when it really boils down to
it or whatever it just seems like haze was
[SPEAKER_00]: You know a mix of Colombian strains or
whatever that they got out of seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: import Yeah, and they got lucky and
admittedly it doesn't seem like they knew
[SPEAKER_00]: what the hell they were doing yeah,
you know and it got pretty famous and so
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of stories and a lot of
mystery between late 60s and mid 80s
[SPEAKER_00]: There's stories out of Santa Cruz There's
a series of brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrote some stuff and high top like
there's all these various things and and
[SPEAKER_00]: You know They've been debated ad nauseam
other places So maybe we don't need to
[SPEAKER_00]: like delve into that part because you can
find that everywhere But what is part of
[SPEAKER_00]: it is that what's indisputable is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: In 84 84 ish or so Sam's gunk man brought
it to Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so these guys grew haze it got
famous They were growing it in Santa Cruz
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a mix of sativas mostly Colombian
and it was getting sold in New York and
[SPEAKER_00]: then at some point Sam took a version of
it to Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and as far as we can tell he You
know, he gave it to three people Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what it yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he gave it to Positronix who we
actually worked with yeah, and he gave it
[SPEAKER_00]: to Corel from Super sativa seed club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep that Corel talked about when we
interviewed him and he gave it to Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep and All three all three of those guys
made hybrids with it and sold seeds From
[SPEAKER_00]: that and pretty much all haze that we can
really we can really trace Comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: either those three people or stock that
made that Sam made himself in Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_00]: later Yeah off seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kept for himself And we really don't
have any verified American haze do we?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean we have We have the
originator that we all agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everybody agrees that Lund was a
part of it Debatable on the the lady
[SPEAKER_02]: Kathy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's debatable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have I'm just gonna say first
name since it doesn't really neither here
[SPEAKER_02]: nor there but There is one guy who keeps
all the posters and as he explained it to
[SPEAKER_02]: me Was that that the posters were hung up
in the dealers houses that were verified
[SPEAKER_02]: legit haze dealers And that's kind of how
they verified if they were getting real
[SPEAKER_02]: haze or not If that poster was in their
room, then they knew that they were
[SPEAKER_02]: getting legit haze there So that's how he
told it now if it's true or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know But he seems to have the
lion's share of the original posters and
[SPEAKER_02]: he got them somehow Yeah somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so You know and then like a lot of
those things like not everybody Not
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody involved Probably has told their
story publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah by any means and so and you know,
there's a few people that are lying About
[SPEAKER_00]: it that insists they know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but what we know is it made it there
Yeah, it made it to Amsterdam and
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's all the stuff that made haze
famous Sort of came from Amsterdam back to
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say yeah Wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think yeah You didn't it wasn't
like he's popped up here and kept rocking
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody's rocking that cut from here
So what we don't know is it seems like you
[SPEAKER_00]: know when we interviewed Correll from
Super Santiva Seed Club, he gave us a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty interesting tidbit and that Sam
only he didn't think Sam had that many
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds of it because he only gave him like
ten Yeah, and he thought that he only gave
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville some Neville disputes that But be
that as it may You know Neville ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: probably making the most famous hybrids
with it By far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you could say that, you know,
but positronics Had it as well original
[SPEAKER_00]: and so did Super Santiva Seed Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they all had originals and it seems
like when you read the stories about what
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville and all the rest of them did is
that They were kind of like us growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's kind of like the sour that
you know a lot of the starting stories It
[SPEAKER_00]: was like a bunch of kids that were young
that didn't know what the fuck they were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing at all And they made a bunch of
rookie mistakes Yeah, because they weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: used to growing something that took 22
weeks or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a jungle plant And you know,
and it seems like a number of them got
[SPEAKER_00]: lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah by everybody Accidents didn't you
know mom got killed?
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't think it was worth much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took, you know, 25 weeks and never
finished You know that kind of thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: so They didn't realize what kind of gold
they had I Don't know not at the time so
[SPEAKER_00]: much hindsight needed for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they had they had no idea So Neville
Neville had you know a few males and a few
[SPEAKER_00]: females That he burned through and didn't
keep Before he you know, he ended up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean he ended up only by 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: He only had one plant that had lived.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah You know And so someone keeps asking
you I did Sam get invited that Sam's never
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to come on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, I mean To be honest, that's why I
said it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you want to hear Sam's opinion
about it There you could go hunt on You
[SPEAKER_00]: know archives or something or anything
like that like he's posted a ton On his
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there's not a shortage of Sam's
written history.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we didn't focus on it for that
long You know, he disagreed with me on the
[SPEAKER_02]: Kathy part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he said that the grand Eddie Mike was
incorrect on that You know that that's
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what he said and it might be true,
you know, so yeah, that's what little I
[SPEAKER_02]: know From him after I told the story the
last time based on grand Eddie Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one thing that he had He said
it was it was very good, but that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: correct So from Sam's away The reason why
we kind of glossed over that part is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the hardest part to talk about
because it's the least documented Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and it's a bunch of history from
a bunch of people doing some black market
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal shit in America yeah, all trying
to stay under the radar and as far as as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as the You know the haze goes
Everybody knows haze what we just
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned positronix Neville's stuff and
super sativa seed club and Sam are the
[SPEAKER_00]: sources Yeah That all the haze that we
talk about now descends from yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where that's where it all comes
from It's either hybrids they made or
[SPEAKER_00]: descendants of it or whatever and all the
companies like the Flying Dutchman or any
[SPEAKER_00]: of these different groups Seeds men that
sold pure haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Believe they were all just buying kilos
Wholesale from Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to be able to ask him for sure
But it sounds like he was doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: reselling like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean he basically what it sounds like is
to not get in trouble He didn't sell
[SPEAKER_00]: directly to anyone outside of Holland
because seed sales within Holland were
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal Yeah, so he was willing to
wholesale But he wasn't willing to retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So he ended up working through
positronix He ended up I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how I mean, you know It's funny
when people talk about all this like rare
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk one that you Exist and we asked
Corell about it He just laughed and he
[SPEAKER_00]: said everyone gets skunk one from you
know, buying bags of seed from Sam
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuckman Yeah, that's where you got your
skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right Santa Cruz original but
getting back to haze it's Someone asked
[SPEAKER_02]: about the AC taste related to Santa Cruz
original haze I was just gonna say that's
[SPEAKER_02]: that's my ultimate one who was British so
I really Doubted was sourced via Santa
[SPEAKER_00]: Cruz It's just my my theory on it Yeah,
I mean I think I think they sourced it
[SPEAKER_00]: through posi maybe yeah, I don't know who
I know I know Tom Hill's haze line was
[SPEAKER_00]: positronix Yeah, his was and it was his
was very different from the old-timer haze
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so, you know, oh, yeah all Tom
Hill's work and stuff and the deep chunk
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids and all that stuff about
positronix They That was all from for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while there Sam worked with on some
fashion at posi Yeah helping them breed
[SPEAKER_00]: and dude working with Werner and stuff
like that and helping them breed different
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and and Working lines and positronix
was just one of those early seed companies
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when Sam first moved to Amsterdam
he was looking for connections people to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell seeds to and people to work with
Yeah, and he kind of ended up Dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone in town But that was only like a
few dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was really like ongoing then or
whatever, right and positronix also like a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people don't know this part but the
positronix haze 19 skunk one is what gave
[SPEAKER_02]: birth and is the same thing as the metal
haze that I think Bodhi just released f3s
[SPEAKER_02]: of so if you do want like a worked version
of that line That's a very good way to get
[SPEAKER_00]: it So, I don't know I'd never heard
numbers until the corral interview,
[SPEAKER_00]: but corral swore that like Posi him
Neville they only got like a handful like
[SPEAKER_00]: ten seeds each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, and then first time I heard
that too And then and then Sam held the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest back that he had for himself to make
his own open pollination that he did later
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But I you know, I'd never heard that
before But then you know corral was there
[SPEAKER_00]: and we weren't so exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know Neville's dead now,
but he claims he got big bags of old-ass
[SPEAKER_00]: seat But only got you know, eight or ten
of them to pop out of the entire thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah you know, you know and so anyway,
they you know, he comes that mid 80s or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever he comes here and He comes he
comes from California to Holland and he
[SPEAKER_00]: sells Hayes seeds to multiple different
people and then starts working himself And
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the start of Hayes becoming
famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it really didn't for at first
even like The very first thing that Saint
[SPEAKER_00]: that Neville offered was actually a
northern lights crossed to a female hazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah That was year one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was like this Hayes be that was a
girl and it was nl1 Hayes be And then the
[SPEAKER_00]: next year he came out with nl5 Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Didn't even know that I don't think I
knew that part about the bee girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, if you go look in the in the 88
catalog He has I think it's actually a Nl
[SPEAKER_00]: nl1 by Rudder Alice Hi, and he crossed it
to Hayes be And he talks about it being
[SPEAKER_00]: female because he was like trying to to
like tame the the crazy lead time to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you out someone saying you're
incorrect How sure I don't know I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know How sure am I on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we can I got I got that the
catalogs around here, but he the the first
[SPEAKER_00]: two hybrids he really he he really tried
to make was he crossed it to maple leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghan tea and he crossed it to nl5 Hayes
Okay, and nl5 Hayes he released The other
[SPEAKER_00]: one I don't think he released to the
public but he gave to friends or whatnot
[SPEAKER_02]: is a bigger is this the bigger from mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice Forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Okay, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What time no see dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read so many year threads on Mr.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been looking for I've been actually
looking for bigger for quite a while Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I mean he you know, one of the cool
things about mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice is that There was a time in oh 1009,
you know 2010 or something where Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: was very active on there Yeah,
and a ton of knowledge about what happened
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped both publicly and post that he
made and Via DM and communications with
[SPEAKER_00]: various people that were active at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah On mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and bigger was definitely one of
those guys That was active in
[SPEAKER_00]: communication and like Matt said he had a
great write-up on the history of it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can probably still go read Yeah herb
was around when when when Neville came
[SPEAKER_02]: back and I started getting fucking around
with him and trying to work the bubbles
[SPEAKER_02]: and all that shit and It kind of petered
off on the mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice forums after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really really took a dive after all
that shit Yeah, so somebody's asked a
[SPEAKER_00]: question which I'll answer just because it
ties in They were they were asking did
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville have both an a and a c-mail and
did he use them to breed in various
[SPEAKER_00]: things?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it sounds like is that Neville
ended up with two guys Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and the a and the a in the seat,
right and It was easier to use the males
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was easier to collect pollen
and then dust a bunch of indica females at
[SPEAKER_00]: the appropriate time Than it was to try to
deal with the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess yeah, so for lack of a better way
he ended up with a couple boys and the the
[SPEAKER_00]: a He lost in 1989.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a huge seed increase and put all of
his best Indica's in there like the g13
[SPEAKER_00]: and the nl5 and a bunch of different stuff
and then Him and his workers forgot to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep a backup in the bedroom Yeah,
so he bloomed every a male and they all
[SPEAKER_00]: died and he lost it So after that happened
so often keeping big libraries,
[SPEAKER_00]: too So he never sold any commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never sold any commercial amounts of
haze Yeah, he popped him himself and gave
[SPEAKER_00]: out various phenos of it which we'll get
to in a little bit and He might he gave
[SPEAKER_00]: some private amounts of seed to friends
other breeders people early on You know
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot, but it was never sold
commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything you ever could buy
commercially was the seed ad So all nl5
[SPEAKER_00]: haze see all nl5 haze that you could buy
from the seed bank or from sensei seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: was the seed right and that's so that's
kind of like what Everybody's got Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd bring big herb on the live.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if he's ready to just be pop
on on camera all of a sudden But he's more
[SPEAKER_00]: than welcome to come on It's no,
but I will read will definitely reach out
[SPEAKER_00]: to you after the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a wealth of knowledge Yeah,
and and would be cool to add to things but
[SPEAKER_00]: You know so Neville Neville had an nl5
haze was probably the most famous It's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably what put haze on the map to be
perfectly honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah And what I mean by that is that it
just made it a permanent part of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: lore Yeah inundated the United States it
did and he you know in 89 and 90 The
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures on the front of his catalog were
an nl5 haze a yeah Huge running colas big
[SPEAKER_00]: bud, you know all that and it was that and
super skunk ended up being him and
[SPEAKER_00]: sensei's best-selling seed lines so nl5
haze kind of changed the game and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: super potent and It's probably I've said
it on shows with Matt before in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the most successful hybrid
ever made I wonder if it's because like
[SPEAKER_02]: the line was kicking out more Keepers,
you know things that people wanted or just
[SPEAKER_02]: because so many were sold You were
eventually gonna find a keeper because it
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't super easy to find keepers and all
those packs was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I never found a fucking keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I bought I definitely I bought
plenty of packs Yeah, not plenty,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I mean I probably bought seven or
eight packs in the in the in the mid 90s
[SPEAKER_00]: But then other people from that same year
and same era as me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's things that are still true
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it seems like that that strain
was consistent from somewhere to 89 to the
[SPEAKER_00]: mid 90s Yeah, Neville says they lost the
nl5 mom before he left sensei,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was in 95 96 but and basically like
all the all the haze that we know of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenos that have been kept all Seem to
trace back to that late 80s through mid
[SPEAKER_00]: 90s era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and there's a fun like yeah,
and there's a fucking bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a shitload.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean somebody may not even be Identified
as nl5 haze like bull rider might be nl5
[SPEAKER_02]: haze based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah old Betsy Yeah, exactly sister of
bull rider or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so what ends up happening is that
Maybe we can like You know, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting Big herb because we've always
wondered there's been a rumor that the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuban black Could have been from gifted
seeds to someone that Neville knew You
[SPEAKER_00]: know and it could be it could have been a
in that case But I've heard that rumor
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's true But I poo poo
the Cuban black.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a fuck what anyone says like
though at least the clones circulating
[SPEAKER_02]: right now In the community because I knew
exactly who brought it in and that dude
[SPEAKER_02]: kept fucking lying about everything he had
So I think it's very I'm very skeptical
[SPEAKER_02]: Skeptical with what?
[SPEAKER_02]: With what goes around today as a Cuban
black case It might be some kind of nl5
[SPEAKER_00]: haze, but it is not the original I know
what what you know, I mean we can you know
[SPEAKER_00]: We're bouncing around and I apologize
because it's like a multi-decade story or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, basically And we can dive into
different parts at different times but
[SPEAKER_00]: basically between you know 89 and and 95
or so there's probably like 10 or 15
[SPEAKER_00]: elites Maybe a few more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that have survived from that era that
are all named cuts and still held on to
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah of mostly nl5 haze Whether it uses
the a dad of the seed dad, but some g13
[SPEAKER_00]: haze some hash plant haze various
different things Yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only ever had the hash plant haze and
hybrids They so basically yeah Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: basically crossed it to like all his best
Indicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it got crossed the hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got crossed the g13.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got crossed to nl5.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got crossed the nl1 Anything that he
had that was an indica that he thought was
[SPEAKER_00]: a bomb clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah God, you know, so so that's kind of
where like people are talking PIF isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing all this we'll get to that in a
second, but basically What happened is is
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole series we can talk about
of famous clones in Europe That Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: hunted and found and then passed out to
friends Yeah, and those got those got held
[SPEAKER_00]: and like some people call them the
southern the I almost said southern humble
[SPEAKER_00]: the southern Holland South Holland crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, South Holland crew And they've been
sold in coffee shops for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah when I when I first went,
you know to coffee shops in Amsterdam you
[SPEAKER_00]: could get nl5 hate you could get a five
you could get c5 you could you get g13 you
[SPEAKER_00]: could get hash plant haze basically every
every trip I went somewhere had You know
[SPEAKER_00]: various versions of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so they were sold and a lot of
people came to Holland to smoke those
[SPEAKER_00]: hazes So there was these famous cuts and
there's a lot of them that are 30 years
[SPEAKER_00]: old now or whatever that got That got
saved in Europe and there's like a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: map to that And then at the same time
there was a bunch of people that were
[SPEAKER_00]: trading seeds with Neville and buying a
bunch of Neville seeds and it seems like a
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of New York and Florida right
It blew up and got super popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and there was markets for it a lot
of the people in Florida were actually
[SPEAKER_00]: sending it to New York because it blew up
in New York and Got a top dollar and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's rumors that it's been kind of a
thing in New York since the 70s Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: like there's always been a high-end
clientele of like Wall Street brokers
[SPEAKER_00]: musicians artists Connected people that
are we're willing to drop big money for
[SPEAKER_00]: haze Yeah, as long as I've been a smoker
you could go to New York and find haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I wonder why that is It just caught
on and never I don't know But like I
[SPEAKER_02]: wonder why Dominican crews picked up on it
in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder why certain ethnic, you know
groups just Navigated to that specific
[SPEAKER_02]: type.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it that New Yorkers just tend to like
more speedy weed, you know I mean in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case the best haze in the world in my
opinion is in Amsterdam and You know New
[SPEAKER_00]: York and Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the West Coast gets jacked like we
literally we get jack and super silver
[SPEAKER_00]: haze and You know, like we get a lot of
hybrids of that kind of thing and those
[SPEAKER_00]: are more like the poly hybrids that came
later Yeah, right like you know they on
[SPEAKER_00]: the East Coast They have a bunch of f1s
and s1s of f1s and you know, and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: people are gonna talk about it You know,
there's people talk about names like
[SPEAKER_00]: Heights haze downtown Brown Piff Church
Cuban black You know, it seems like there
[SPEAKER_00]: was groups of Dominicans and groups of
Cubans that had it on lockdown Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know people call it block work Because
they could get it on the block.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was green haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was brown haze, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah And it's really hard if you're not
from there to know all the different You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, are they phenos?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they the same thing grown different
ways?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they called different hybrid names is
I mean, I talked to some people that were
[SPEAKER_00]: in the know And I used to think that it
was like, you know half a dozen names from
[SPEAKER_00]: the same couple cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But it turns out that in the 30 years
that haze has been popular in New York and
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fucking plethora.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's even There's like Pude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always wondered what that stood for It's
a weird word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean there's all kinds of
nicknames and stuff and so yeah what's
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy about the haze is that the And don't
take any offense to this anyone but like
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cubans and the Dominicans and whoever
that were running it They viewed it very
[SPEAKER_00]: much so as a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and they held that shit fucking
tight They weren't into into sharing it
[SPEAKER_00]: with trading they had like a market and
their market was good And they were into
[SPEAKER_00]: it and there's dudes that I've talked to
that like their entire career basically
[SPEAKER_00]: just grown haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, that's all they needed to
do was grow haze get it to New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't share that shit So but
what's interesting about that is like
[SPEAKER_00]: unlike a lot of like random?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuts you get like where you kind of have
to get the cut a lot of those dudes once
[SPEAKER_00]: they realize they couldn't get the real
cut They just went and bought beans
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can still buy the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you but you know It's like
imagine if your buddies are selling it for
[SPEAKER_00]: a ton of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might go to Amsterdam and buy a
hundred seeds Yeah, and come back and pop
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch and then all of a sudden you've
got the You know, I've got I've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: PIF.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've got the Cuban black,
you know, they called it my experience and
[SPEAKER_02]: this is this is I remember bigger I was
trying to push a bunch of these off on him
[SPEAKER_02]: because I knew like no one wanted him But
when I got the PIF the Dominicans asked me
[SPEAKER_02]: not to release it pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the only request they had Don't
release it pure and I wasn't gonna fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: snub that, you know, like you don't piss
anyone off So I never did but I really
[SPEAKER_02]: regret it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean they have there's a market So
I don't claim to be an expert I mean with
[SPEAKER_00]: there's there's different people we could
probably bring on maybe in the future That
[SPEAKER_00]: know a lot more about the various names
and origins of the various different haze
[SPEAKER_00]: things from New York I just wanted to
bring it up in general that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of cuts that get passed around in
Florida and New York more but but Florida
[SPEAKER_00]: too and a bunch in Holland and between
those two areas That's like 15 different
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, at least a bunch So it's probably
the line that has the most we're lucky if
[SPEAKER_00]: one or two Finos of any famous thing
survives from the 90s to today Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: right Can you think of any other line from
that era that has as many cuts as nl5 haze
[SPEAKER_00]: does that still float around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even close man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still trying to find a single lot of
these lines, you know Yeah, so You know
[SPEAKER_00]: and so, you know some of this stuff people
are talking about gold or brown haze or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever In my opinion and I've seen it in
like chem four and I've seen it in various
[SPEAKER_00]: strains You know certain strains just when
it when they're when they're around
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sort of cure a little bit brown Yeah,
I used to get member like the the real
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry pie when it was growing would be
like deep purple and would look all crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: when I Did it depths and then I dry it and
three weeks later it would the the the
[SPEAKER_02]: purple would turn a little light brown Oh,
man, I hated that about like blackberries
[SPEAKER_02]: to like that beautiful magenta red as it
dries It turned just this nasty money turn
[SPEAKER_00]: brown and some of those some of those haze
crosses turn brown as they dry It's the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian influence I believe and so it
might be terpies all get out and fresh and
[SPEAKER_00]: smell delicious And someone looks at it
and they're like this shit's old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you have old weed, you know So it's
just like it's a it's a You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean even like we I was we were talking
about it I was talking about it earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: today, but I have a buddy who made the
chocolate top the the chocolate diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right and it's and that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a chocolate tie by dog by
sour diesel Yeah, and it was phenomenal
[SPEAKER_00]: and we had it for a long time and no one
wanted to ever buy it because it cured a
[SPEAKER_00]: light brown Yeah, because the chocolate
part wasn't so much it's Smelled like
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that the tie was brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and and and like Pharrell said back
in the day They wanted that brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that brown was it was good
brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fresh Yeah, like it was fucked up,
but it just a little yellow little brown
[SPEAKER_00]: little off colors Yeah, but what's crazy
about haze is that that is like death on
[SPEAKER_00]: the West Coast Right brown any kind of
brown color at all and it's like doom and
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see people in the comments or
whatever talking about all the for Uptown
[SPEAKER_00]: Browns my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's The one I'd give me that
brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah you know, so There's a bunch of stuff
like that where I can name them real quick
[SPEAKER_00]: when we talk about A or C It's just
basically like a Holland shorthand for
[SPEAKER_00]: Which may which Hayes mail of Nevels was
used?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's at least three c5s That float
around Holland that are still alive for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure one of them is the is is called the
one and that's the mom of Super Silver
[SPEAKER_00]: Haze and it's floats around it's actually
in America right now And it's what people
[SPEAKER_00]: some people if you see people posting in
America of c5.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that cut Okay, so the c5 cut in
America is the one the c5 cut in America
[SPEAKER_00]: is it's like the turpentine bomb Yes,
it's what made Super Silver Haze so
[SPEAKER_00]: turpentine dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know and You know and so it it's
it's being passed around it made it over
[SPEAKER_00]: the and it's really Amazing uplifting
super potent weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just you have to be able to handle
turpentine Yeah, you don't like
[SPEAKER_00]: turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be a real problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke turpentine all day and And so
there's like three c5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: The final c5 was my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to smoke it over there in Amsterdam
It's the they call it the 122 or the mango
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's the mom of mango Hayes and It
just take it has more of that mercy like I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't forget I forget what the turpentine
Is that leads to mangoes and but it smells
[SPEAKER_00]: like ripe mangoes and it's got a great
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah c5 isn't SSH c5 is the mom of SSH
Someone just said so so then there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: there's three cuts of c5 at least over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two cuts of a five They say
there's a G 13 a there's a G 13 C.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a hash plant by C I Might be
missing a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but there's a bunch of them over
there and and then most of the ones in
[SPEAKER_00]: America are Are you know nl5 cross the
sea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, even I should mention too that
Neville gave Soma of Soma seeds some G 13
[SPEAKER_00]: a and He took a mail of that and all of
Soma's Sativa and hazy lines are based off
[SPEAKER_00]: that that mail that he kept from some G 13
a seeds that he Got and so what it seems
[SPEAKER_00]: like Neville was pretty open about this on
on the on the forums over there was Hayes
[SPEAKER_00]: does not like being crossed to itself No,
yeah at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what becomes hard is especially with
the sea The more you cross Hayes to itself
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville called it cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would probably we would probably call
it Turpentine But but the more you cross
[SPEAKER_00]: it you get turpentine dominant and then
only rarely do others any kind of and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what everybody thinks of is Jack
Jack turps train wreck turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep Super silver Hayes turps that kind of
stuff tends to dominate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, what it seems like is The best
ones the ones that everybody keeps are the
[SPEAKER_00]: F ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah of Hayes to some indica and the poly
hybrids like Super silver Hayes mango
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes Jack Harare that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't seem to be as People don't seem
to have keepers of those the same way now
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's not cuts of them that don't
float around it might be nice Yeah But we
[SPEAKER_00]: should mention too because it's fucking
we're kind of like a ramble or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: but most of these things are they're one
of the most unique things about Hayes is
[SPEAKER_00]: that Most of the good ones take between 12
and 16 weeks Yeah Long time long time a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time like I think the Cuban blacks
and a lot of the ones in New York 90 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 days is a pretty common Rate to take
those ones The dog shit, which is about
[SPEAKER_00]: the only West Coast one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's any good That one's 12 13 weeks
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you know all the stuff from Europe
You know was is all 15 16 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know and so that was One of the
things that Neville and Shanti and all
[SPEAKER_00]: those guys that were fucking around with
it one of their criteria was They didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: want anything longer than 16 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Because it was impractical because
asking someone to flower something for
[SPEAKER_00]: four months is already impractical Yeah,
especially if it's a money-making thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, so there's an aspect where
it's like I You know, they cut it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted 14 to 16 weeks You know and it
seems like the earliest good ones are more
[SPEAKER_00]: like 12 13 Yeah, you know But 14 to 16
seems to be the most common range that a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of them fall into I was a big fan of
the old sog super silver Hayes That was
[SPEAKER_02]: one of my favorites that ran pretty quick
and was mostly skunk one dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure Yeah, I mean those you know the super
silver Hayes and the mango Hayes were both
[SPEAKER_00]: Two different nl5 Hayes moms crossed to
the same skunk Hayes dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah right So the skunk helps like throw
especially in the super silver it helped
[SPEAKER_00]: it throw bigger longer thicker colas Yeah,
and it could shorten up the time a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch In my opinion, you know and So,
you know they so then it just became going
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just became fucking famous Yeah,
everybody had Hayes and all these seed
[SPEAKER_00]: companies wanted to obscure exactly how
they got Hayes But Hayes just became Hayes
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while was sort of shorthand for
sativa Yeah, it was the sativa Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you know, and it got famous in
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got famous over there It was all these
various different things And it seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like I said the f1s seem to be a
lot better than the poly hybrids Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the poly harbor hybrids weren't
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown nice super silver Hayes I've
had keepers of mango Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved But it seems Like all the most
favorite ones are f1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So some type of Afghani or Paki cross
the Hayes across the Hayes very two very
[SPEAKER_00]: different things slapped together And then
you see what they get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and even with those things crossed
to it still the keepers were 14 16 weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so essentially like you're taking
some Colombian and like shortening it from
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 to 24 to 14 to 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen Colombian black go up to 26.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, and so people are talking
about piff piff is just You know piff is a
[SPEAKER_00]: catch-all term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, or it's one of the nicknames to
Hayes Yeah, you know people can argue I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna sit there and say that I have
some Encyclopedic knowledge of how all the
[SPEAKER_00]: New York Hayes terms came about Yeah,
but it got a bunch of it was popular
[SPEAKER_00]: enough for long enough that it has a bunch
of nicknames Right, yeah, I said it before
[SPEAKER_00]: Heights Hayes uptown Brown Cuban Bulldog
Black Block work Church Frankie short for
[SPEAKER_00]: frankincense, you know All that all that
different types of stuff boy in there said
[SPEAKER_02]: Pude stands for pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that's what it meant I don't
know if that's Colombian for pure
[SPEAKER_02]: Dominican for pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a lot of nicknames Yeah,
you know and probably just like Kush and
[SPEAKER_00]: just like cookie just like everything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got popular people got bag seeds people
got lines from Amsterdam And pop their own
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and added their own name to it
because they're trying to cash in on the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing So it's really hard to say but for
rarely, you know that line was available
[SPEAKER_02]: for seven or eight years in seed form
Okay, I have an idea I have an idea for a
[SPEAKER_02]: little game we can play I'm gonna name a
few different Hayes cuts and you're gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: say pass or smoke oh And you're gonna be
passing It to an idiot or you're gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke it yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, um a five smoke smoke Okay,
see five smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew you'd go for both of them dog shit
Definitely smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you smoked all Betsy?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no haven't tried it or bull rider to
be honest Yeah, yeah, that's the most I
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't smoked for a bull rider that I
know of you know, like it just wasn't easy
[SPEAKER_02]: It already died out by the time I got San
Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's see here I'm trying to think of
some some good hazy cuts that you've tried
[SPEAKER_02]: Kelly missed Smoke there's nothing you're
not gonna smoke that has Hayes in it now
[SPEAKER_02]: that I think about I don't think I could
name one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you I could yeah, I I would there's
There's not really a Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wished I had a jar on my on my On my on
my on my shelf there Wow, so Jack you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna pass on a Jack I would pass on the
Jack or pass on Jack Jack to me is like a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge yielding skunk one on a Hayes frame
Yeah, you know and it's like just I I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know it like the type of turpentine
that Jack is is not my favorite It's more
[SPEAKER_00]: like it doesn't taste good to me You know,
I know people love it You know and people
[SPEAKER_00]: loved it because they got two three pounds
of light with it and they crushed it in
[SPEAKER_00]: depths and greenhouses and they basically
Grew the shit out of it until the buyers
[SPEAKER_00]: were like, uh You know, yeah How about
you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you tried amnesia?
[SPEAKER_02]: Amnesia is some watered-down shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was it's one of my favorites
It is one of my favorites by far because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's so like perfumey fruity like it's
just nice man Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like I like the I like the
church the frankincense the mercy Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't I'm not a turpentine Hater by any
means like I said, I mean like I said c5
[SPEAKER_00]: is a turpentine bomb Yeah, but there's a
difference to me between turpentine that
[SPEAKER_00]: has a little bit of sweetness or
creaminess behind it And like I just
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed my mouth with like floor cleaner
Yeah, that's true and that that
[SPEAKER_00]: turpentine, you know It's like and I think
for Jack and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just a bunch of badly grown Jack
and It over what just like trainwreck,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it overwhelms people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know like That Durbin that
Durbin from Colorado or whatever that
[SPEAKER_00]: one's a turpentine bomb to sure is you
know Super turpentine and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like I like there's all kinds of
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke I'm not a hater on it Yeah,
but when I when I the interesting part to
[SPEAKER_00]: me is it's not so much The only thing I
can think of that's like really strong
[SPEAKER_00]: turpentine that I love the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah is the c5 interesting Does it for
you, you know, I don't know why that is
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah you know, but they You know,
what's cool about it is that because it
[SPEAKER_00]: made money in coffee shops for so long and
still does It's still hoarded over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and people accuse us of hoarding
that shit is legit hoarded people are like
[SPEAKER_02]: so many people put stipulations on those
fucking cuts like There are certain seed
[SPEAKER_02]: lines like me and Caleb can never release
No, because they'll be they'll be super
[SPEAKER_00]: pissed off and people yeah angry and it's
like and You know, it's been monetized
[SPEAKER_00]: over there for so long and been sold in
coffee shops And if you got the cuts you
[SPEAKER_00]: had to give kickbacks to the dudes that I
was like very So those things it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: and they don't give a fuck They don't want
to trade you for shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have they have and they don't it so
that's like the ultimate hoarding because
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly They didn't slip out until
Neville died.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah the entire time that he was alive
That shit was on lockdown with those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, and then to only two of those cuts
maybe more but only you know, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that One of the sources for those
cuts I was sent a list with those on to me
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like I want those two and the dude
didn't even know what the fuck they were
[SPEAKER_02]: till I told him what they were and that
was the biggest mistake I ever made I know
[SPEAKER_02]: you I don't like to dick people And be
like, you know, I'm not I wanted I'd like
[SPEAKER_02]: to trade equal value.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if they find out later It's rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: They at least got the worth but yeah,
I mean the hard the hard part is the hard
[SPEAKER_00]: part is that You know, these things would
never be popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you really have you really have to
like the high Because you should know what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're growing tubes I see a lot of people
asking about the a5s ones and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not gonna be a super like
marketable commercial crop now A day is
[SPEAKER_02]: that would sell really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think people have this like
fantasized idea because you're saying it's
[SPEAKER_02]: dank and they they respect your word They
don't understand what it would with with
[SPEAKER_00]: this definition of dank would look like
Dank and ugly it is Like I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: before like people were talking on the
thing about how much they love the uptown
[SPEAKER_00]: brown Yeah, you couldn't sell uptown brown
in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: No fucking way No, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if I agree with you and I say that
weeds amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still wouldn't sell here Yeah,
it just couldn't and like if you see the
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures of a5 there's no resin production
anywhere on any leaf No for miles and you
[SPEAKER_02]: just look at it be like fuck that dude
sucks it growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really it's it's the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ugly Yeah, but it works You know,
and so you really have to be into the high
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's like there every like all these
Dutch You're like trying to hoard it like
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans are gonna like fuck with their
money Yeah when you really have to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer like a lover of cannabis because
it takes four months so you have to Plan
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's gonna take twice as long as the
rest of your shit Yeah, and you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it happy and healthy and bug free and
pee and all the various issues free that
[SPEAKER_00]: long and it don't wash Yeah, and then you
know and then you get some great weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and so So it's not you know,
but in Holland it's like all my first
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences with smoking all those ones
were all Holland growing Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe I could tell a story that people
people might like so I went and saw this
[SPEAKER_00]: room in Holland that was growing Neville's
haze and c5 and then 122 right and so I go
[SPEAKER_00]: into this room and it was one of it I only
met Neville a couple of times but it was
[SPEAKER_00]: one of his partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and so I go into this room and It's
like there's like one gallon pots on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground Okay with those grow Dan like
Rockwell rock wool croutons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know like the Little croutons
little croutons little squares,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah one gallon pots with these stems
coming out of them that were like that big
[SPEAKER_00]: And those stems went six seven feet up in
the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay bear, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so imagine this little one gallon pot
with this stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like half as wide as the pot Yeah
going six feet straight up and then
[SPEAKER_00]: branches everywhere and like two or three
layers of Of netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then they just had a bunch of
six hundreds on the ceiling I forgot to
[SPEAKER_02]: tell you I had a conversation with Seattle
Greg the other day and he said when he
[SPEAKER_02]: went into Neville's grow room He said when
he first got there Neville was growing
[SPEAKER_00]: rock wool slabs on the ground on the
ground Yeah, and they had bad drains in
[SPEAKER_00]: there or whatever else and they would be
honest like the slowest constant drip
[SPEAKER_00]: ever, you know But it was like you're
looking at literally these they were
[SPEAKER_00]: probably 10 12 20 10 12 foot Paul plants
that was like where the weed was and it
[SPEAKER_00]: started at Above I'm six three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started above my head That's like I
walked in and all the netting was above my
[SPEAKER_00]: head and there's these tiny ass little
pots on slow drip and just like a sea of
[SPEAKER_00]: Spears above how big was the ceiling how
tall of ceilings?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were pretty tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like 14 feet or something like
that Yeah, they had to be I mean if the
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking canopy starts at the top of your
head That's a canopy started the canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: started about seven feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about half a foot above my head
She's from seven to ten feet was where
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the weed was and then the light
we're hanging off the ceiling and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like six feet like you looked and there
was like a sea of Brand of stock Coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the thing and going up above your
head and then branching out the huge
[SPEAKER_00]: branches all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wild It was pretty wide never seen
at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never seen anything like that before
in my life because People are confusing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying they thought you were five
foot ten.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm five foot ten Yeah, I'm six three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was above my head and you know
What's crazy about that is that their drip
[SPEAKER_00]: system fails for instance that shit's dead
in like two hours Yeah, that that's what's
[SPEAKER_02]: always scared me about like drip systems
feeds hydroponic systems I mean it was
[SPEAKER_00]: literally on like the slowish drip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could imagine it was basically
constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, it's constant feed during
the light cycle, you know, so Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was it was pretty but that's how they
grew and that was Neville's haze and the
[SPEAKER_00]: mango haze and the c5 Yeah, and those were
all grown for coffee shops at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know And they were dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the Neville's haze is is a five by
hay see You know and the cut that I love
[SPEAKER_00]: still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that it gets sent over to America
sometime I would grow up with the fuck you
[SPEAKER_02]: laughing at Everybody's down my height No,
he sure is fuck like ten, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's he's short.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know He's he's he's short,
you know, so five ten is a little short,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're right He might I don't know Girl
Pinocchio knows all my there is there is
[SPEAKER_00]: there was some really good Neville's
hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's rumor What's really hard
to substantiate anything with Shanti or
[SPEAKER_00]: any of the euro guys in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know if Neville's haze is the
same or not Yeah You know, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't someone asked if we could break
down karma's a five s1.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Snitch haze s1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, I mean, you know, he he
reversed the I don't think the I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think the I Don't think the hazes like
being bred even to even to Out crosses of
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I certainly don't want that doesn't
seem like they like to be s1 very much No,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of ugly in them
motherfuckers I mean, yeah, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of ugly you might get and that's part of
the problem too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when it comes to haze You know
The best stuff is gonna be three to four
[SPEAKER_00]: months a Bunch of it's gonna be junk a
bunch of it's gonna be jungle weed Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not gonna know for forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a long time to frickin You know
to get it going so it's like I mean I can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell a story that I I've told privately or
whatever But I went out I went out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cup And I think it was 98 or
something like that and it was the first
[SPEAKER_00]: year that they released Neville's haze
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay and Neville's haze was so
everybody knows it was supposed to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: private breeding of Of Neville's and he
was trying to make what he called the Holy
[SPEAKER_00]: Grail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah a haze line, so he took He took his
favorite a five Which which was on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cover of the 89 and 90 catalog that female
and he Threw that on the haze sea male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it was the first time he tried
to breed both haze dads into a single
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and They found this cut over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the strongest sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ever smoked in my life I've talked
about it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, just that was a female, you know,
yeah Yeah, it make I mean it it is
[SPEAKER_00]: unbelievably potent in a way that weed is
not normally potent Yeah, and so I smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: it over there And it blew my head off like
it it made it hard for me to walk
[SPEAKER_00]: downstairs Yeah, I like held onto the
railing and I felt disassociated and I
[SPEAKER_00]: felt like it hit me in a weird It made me
feel like I was smoking kind bud with no
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Like I got it was intense and I got
high for hours And so I just brought some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these seeds home and I'd never grown an
extreme sativa before so I was gonna breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with this fucker and I grew it for a few
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some cuttings and Then once they
rooted and I knew I had backup copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I flipped it to see what was up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Well, I flipped it at 1212,
you know, this is like 1999 or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I made that mistake before too Yeah,
and it it vegged for months with no
[SPEAKER_00]: pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just you wait and you're like week
seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like Yeah, and I was like what the
fun like all my shits finishing up and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's barely starting and I was like,
yeah so I Like I I tossed them and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: took clones and I flowered those And then
I put more shit in there because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to breed with it and then the same
fucking thing happened Right and I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know at the time That a lot of those guys
over there will tell you that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: really want to get your sativas to do well
Yeah, clone them a few times and let the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant itself get to be six or seven months
old Yeah, because that's its natural veg
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle before it would even start to bloom
in the tropics Yeah, you got to realize
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna veg for a long ass time and
he's like no if you're getting An a5 cut
[SPEAKER_00]: that was popped in 89.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just flip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's obviously Yeah, and then I
didn't know anything about 1114 or 10 1113
[SPEAKER_00]: or 1014 or anything like that,
which is basically just like for people
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't grow It's how much hours of
light and how much hours of darkness?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so 1212 for You know 22 years ago or
whatever that was fine for all my indica's
[SPEAKER_00]: for nevels.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like veg Yeah in order to get it
to start I had to Give it 11 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: light and 13 hours of darkness It had to
be over six months old and then I had to
[SPEAKER_00]: finish it at 1014 for like the final six
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, and so I fucked up a bunch
Yeah, I did that with the malawi too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's the one who taught me that trick
because I would have never I would even
[SPEAKER_02]: made Sense of it back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I had no idea I didn't I didn't even
make sense of it until I had a buddy in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam who grew for Neville and I Went
back to Europe and saw him the next year
[SPEAKER_00]: and told him like basically my follies
Yeah, and he just laughed at me and he
[SPEAKER_00]: laid all that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I had I had no idea I mean it
makes sense when someone says it like and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like, oh God that makes sense and
how easy yeah every other strain I'd ever
[SPEAKER_00]: grown of cannabis at that point in time
when I turn the lights back to 1212
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I needed to happen happened
Yeah, that was my first Experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: like weed that didn't do that You know and
and so that's only with extreme sativa is
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's got enough indicate and it should
trigger It's only if and it's only if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: from seed Because seeds know they're young
Someone was asking if any of us had grown
[SPEAKER_02]: Cali miss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's an old Original pack low numbered
pack early on of Cali miss that we haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: popped yet One day, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so yeah one day You know, so I mean it
should be said about the Cali miss Simon
[SPEAKER_00]: worked for Neville Its origins are unknown
Neville thinks that it's an nl5 haze a
[SPEAKER_00]: female It's uh, but he think he you know,
he thought that everything in Europe was
[SPEAKER_00]: based off his work So that's not surprise
you thought everything in America was
[SPEAKER_00]: based off his work But what is interesting
is that having talked to some Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: people?
[SPEAKER_00]: They say that That the That the Cali mist
was based off a mother plant called the
[SPEAKER_00]: mango Yeah, now whether it's the same
whether it's the same mango that that
[SPEAKER_00]: founded the mango haze and the 122 or
whether it's a different thing I can't say
[SPEAKER_00]: but they said for a long time it was alive
in Europe and then it got and then it got
[SPEAKER_00]: lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah so People talk about Cali mist
Western winds I remember Western winds has
[SPEAKER_02]: Cambo in it or supposedly the same fucking
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it has Cambo in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people that so people that people that
that don't know Tony from SAG Martha and
[SPEAKER_00]: Simon from Sirius had a company that we
talked about before cerebral seeds for one
[SPEAKER_00]: year Right and they split up Tony made SAG
Martha seeds Simon made Sirius seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: Simon's version of the Cali mist was
called Cali mist Tony's version of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same line was called Western winds Which
is I think one of the cooler names in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always liked the name Western winds I
thought that was a super neat name just
[SPEAKER_00]: makes me think of gas You know,
so so yeah, so I've heard people in Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: tell me that they preferred Tony's version
to Simon's that the Western winds But you
[SPEAKER_00]: know then it's hard to say those guys
don't really reveal parentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we don't Know what's in the Cali mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what's in the bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what's in the AK 47 It's
it's hard to say yeah, but but the kid the
[SPEAKER_00]: 90s Cali mist Simon got busted in 99 or
2000 when they changed the laws and It
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like several of his lines changed
after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and the Cali mist was one of them
But in the 90s, there was some really
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing Cali mist cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was it was a nice line You know
So, you know, yeah, it's that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's looks like people, you know people
were getting you could buy They called it
[SPEAKER_00]: pure Hayes f10 Remember from from Flying
Dutchman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, and they'd straight-up tell you 80%
of it is junk 10% of it is is is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good and 10% of it is special I don't know
if if Flying Dutchman said that I know Tom
[SPEAKER_00]: Hill said that I'm pretty sure that They
talked about they talked about how inbred
[SPEAKER_00]: it was already Okay, and that its best use
was for hybrids and outprossing But if you
[SPEAKER_00]: were trying to find a winner be prepared
that only less than 10% Yeah, so you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do like at least a hundred one
hunt Yep, and so doing a hundred hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: plant Hayes hunt is a fucking nightmare
expensive Yes expensive and nightmarish
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's gonna be a bunch of jungle
weed And the shittiest looking weed could
[SPEAKER_00]: end up being fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're not gonna know until you dry
it and smoke it You're not gonna know how
[SPEAKER_00]: potent it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be like look resinless Yeah,
and still take your head off Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean so But what's cool about it is that
it was so fire that it's become one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most common names in cannabis and It's
been blended into all kinds of shit for
[SPEAKER_00]: forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep You know blue dream has Hayes in it,
you know lots of lots of huge yielding
[SPEAKER_00]: plants Have Hayes in their background
because of that stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just stretch the yield If you could
throw if you could like Jack Herrera was
[SPEAKER_00]: basically figuring out a way to get skunk
buds on a Hayes frame Yeah, and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: could get a ginormous Hayes plant with
huge skunk running colas and a little nl
[SPEAKER_00]: density Then you're three pounds of light
bro, yeah Three pounds of light three
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds of light, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the days you're supposed to fucking
Lollipop on for three pounds of light,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't remember it anymore So maybe I
don't know maybe we should we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been Randall rambling about Hayes
for a minute Maybe we should talk a little
[SPEAKER_00]: about so Neville made Neville made all
these all these hybrids only a few of
[SPEAKER_00]: which He ended up selling to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but there was a bunch like the G 13
Hayes crosses and The the silver Hayes
[SPEAKER_00]: which was Afghan a maple leaf Afghan tea
by Hayes and different things he passed
[SPEAKER_00]: out to friends and Other people in
Amsterdam and even some people that bought
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds off him early on Yeah, so those
things got spread out a little bit and
[SPEAKER_00]: there was keepers that were found Even
though you could never buy G 13 by Hayes a
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, you know they had it and Then you
know after that He started trying to make
[SPEAKER_00]: poly hybrids and blend them all together
and cross various select cuts He found he
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to cross he was trying to do Skunk
hay skunk nl and Hayes mixed together
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because he considered those to be
like the three most famous lines in in
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland Yeah, so can I get a plant that
contains all three and it what it's Sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like is it was just a turpentine nightmare
G 13 Hayes all the poly hybrids he was
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know And you know he so there I
went to the the first cup I went to was
[SPEAKER_00]: the jacket there was a cup in 1995
Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: only place that they were and in 95 Ben
and Alan drunkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was actually I guess it was 95 so Ben
and Alan drunkers wanted to Have a
[SPEAKER_00]: commemorative release because the whole
theme for that That cup was Jack Harreir
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Emperor wears no clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and the impact that Jack Harreir it
had on the cannabis movement Right,
[SPEAKER_00]: so there was always going keep going one
second So there was all these there was
[SPEAKER_00]: all this there was all this theme or
whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Neville had been working on this
this nl5 Hayes by skunk Hayes But he
[SPEAKER_00]: hadn't really found what he wanted Yeah,
so Ben and Alan drunkers because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: at sensei and sent and never was at sensei
at the time They convinced him to release
[SPEAKER_00]: this sort of like not ready for primetime
thing And call it Jack Harreir Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's how the Jack Harreir came about
was they had they already had a fino of it
[SPEAKER_00]: That they had at the cup that they had
flour at the cup and then they they
[SPEAKER_00]: released Jack Harreir as a seed line at
sensei seeds that at the cup That was like
[SPEAKER_00]: a big debut was you could buy Jack Harreir
at the cup Damn it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I had my Jack Harreir 95 poster
here, but anyway, so so Jack got Jack got
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack got released Jack supposedly is the
genesis of fucking Brothers Grimm C99 is
[SPEAKER_00]: Bag seed from a coffee shop in Amsterdam
of Jack Harreir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah is the supposed is the Supposed
origins or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be half Jack or full Jack as
you know Suppose supposedly if you believe
[SPEAKER_00]: him it was found in a bout of Jack Harreir
bought at a coffee shop Yeah, and he
[SPEAKER_00]: brought it home and did shit with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville wasn't satisfied with the with
Jack Harreir.
[SPEAKER_00]: He felt it was still unfinished and he
left He left sensei later that year and he
[SPEAKER_00]: kept working on the project and he got
Shanti Baba to help him and they basically
[SPEAKER_00]: they had the mothers that they wanted they
were gonna use the c5 and the 122 and They
[SPEAKER_00]: kept trying to find different skunk haze
dads that would do what they wanted Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and according to them it took a long time
and a bunch of different males and a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of different growing shit out a bunch of
pain in the ass but after a few years they
[SPEAKER_00]: found a skunk haze dad that worked and
Neville preferred that skunk haze crossed
[SPEAKER_00]: to the C5 and Shanti preferred that same
dad crossed to the 122 and they couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: agree on which one was the better line and
better representative so they released
[SPEAKER_00]: both and they called the skunk haze by c5
the super silver haze and they called the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mango haze by same skunk dad mango haze
You know super silver haze is one that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually ran a bunch of and that's
one that I had The hardest time finding
[SPEAKER_02]: keepers in but I have smoked others
keepers Like I said the old socks always
[SPEAKER_02]: one of my favorite but there are some
really good keepers out there But I just
[SPEAKER_00]: never had luck with super so I brought I
brought some to I Think our party a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't mine wasn't super elite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say it was a nice cut It
yielded like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great to death and great to grow
outside Yeah, and it had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: qualities you want in mold resistance and
just general happiness you know it had a
[SPEAKER_00]: light turpentine base or whatever but But
so basically super silver haze and Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: and mango haze are two sisters crossed to
the same dad Mm-hmm You know, so they're
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty close But they're just different,
you know Super silver haze tends to be
[SPEAKER_00]: more turpentine mango haze tends to be a
bit more mercy commit more bit more mango
[SPEAKER_00]: style I Like the mango haze better as a
haze The super silver haze is a crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: production plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then I've had some euros tell me
Like gene finder that there was a super
[SPEAKER_00]: silver haze in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like a 14-week or that was like
their all-time favorite Interesting that
[SPEAKER_00]: one seems lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does But there was an outlier that was
a more hazy more, you know More more,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know less gunk more haze and that one
was supposedly phenomenal But in a poly
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid, it's gonna be hard to to find
something, you know Neville complained
[SPEAKER_00]: that none of his poly hybrid work was as
nice as any of the F ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah No matter how hard he tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just weren't quite as good You know
But I will say that that Neville's haze
[SPEAKER_00]: that he made it's the most potent sativa
I've ever tried In my life and I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: cut still exists in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So it's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought about it I don't think most
breeders or seed makers even talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the failures anymore No, well that's
because most of Instagram and social media
[SPEAKER_00]: is marketing Yeah, yeah, I guess it
doesn't pay to talk about your failures
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, you know I mean,
you know what the greatest cure for
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew was what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come to Graham.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh, you know, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it just disappeared never see it
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So weird Yeah, no one ever struggles with
it Right, and I mean, you know why because
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets curated out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep You're like, oh, this is a beautiful
bud and there's like one spot of you know
[SPEAKER_00]: of mildew on a family for your whatever
and you're just like fuck I remember,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know This is a little off topic But I
do remember when swerve's Cali connection
[SPEAKER_02]: story came out in high times and he was so
proud and you fucking took pictures of it
[SPEAKER_02]: Through it online and the first thing
everyone sees is big old powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking spots all over his leaves Yeah,
we used to get grilled if you'd show up
[SPEAKER_02]: with powdery mildew on anything so I think
the internet culture kind of Negated that
[SPEAKER_02]: because people would get fucking railed on
so, you know, you want to know how I'm I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not big on conspiracy theories Yeah,
you know, but I'll tell a story that most
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the thing that sent powdery
mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Into northern California Mendo and
Humboldt and made it forever an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah was Osama bin Laden and 9-eleven Why
is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 9-eleven happens right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's September 11th and He crashes he
crashes these airliners into the twin
[SPEAKER_00]: towers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so everybody's all freaked out and
they shut down airliners for three days
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay, but they were worried about
them al-qaeda planning biological attacks
[SPEAKER_00]: on cities So they grounded all America's
spray planes so they couldn't spray
[SPEAKER_00]: biological agents for eight weeks Okay,
so from so from September 11th all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: through September all the way through
October No spray pains could be in Marin
[SPEAKER_00]: and Sonoma in Napa in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't have spray planes Okay,
and that's how a bunch of those places
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled powdery mildew Wow,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then in the Santa Rosa paper Which is
the big town in Sonoma?
[SPEAKER_00]: Afterwards you see things like Robert
Mondavi and other people losing millions
[SPEAKER_00]: of dollars in grapes this year to powdery
mildew And all those vineyards are all
[SPEAKER_00]: right by the highway Yeah, and I shit you
not dude in the 90s and in 2000 2001 all
[SPEAKER_00]: the hydro stores I would go into none of
them had any powdery mildew control None
[SPEAKER_00]: of my friends had powdery mildew powdery
mildew was something that you got like
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor maybe in October, maybe a touch
here and there if you got unlucky Never
[SPEAKER_00]: saw it never saw it indoor never ever ever
not not a single clone ever And within two
[SPEAKER_00]: months of 9-eleven happening every single
one of my friends had it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then within a year or two every hydro
store had a whole shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh No, here's how to kill the ship You
know, there was stuff there was
[SPEAKER_00]: biologicals like a cube 10 You know,
there was there was you know, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: There was it was learning about how to
kill that shit and how to get rid of it
[SPEAKER_00]: was uncomfortable Yeah, it was really bunk
because it looked like in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't fucking up your weed Yeah,
but it really fucked up your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it really fucks it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah No, it's like you think spider mites
are fucking up your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not really fucking up your weed
That's really really messing with your
[SPEAKER_00]: herb and so it took a number of years to
figure out how to not transfer it How to
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, no one had ever dealt with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I'd never seen it like the first two
three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived in California four years Maybe I
never saw a single indoor my friends or
[SPEAKER_00]: myself that ever had it Yeah, no,
that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's and now it's like it and then once
it became but then you if you if you think
[SPEAKER_00]: about it, right imagine thousands of acres
of grapes kicking off clouds as the
[SPEAKER_00]: highway drives by a PM that they can't
treat Jesus Christ it just it just it just
[SPEAKER_00]: got all over people's fucking tires that
got kicked in the air it got all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: place and then It's like it's been I'm not
saying that that's the only reason but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been a problem ever since Yeah in all
honesty and then all those clones from
[SPEAKER_00]: NorCal get spread out all over Yeah,
and then people get PM and they don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: how to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know how to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and You know And it's you know,
it's it's just one of those paths Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's obnoxious as fuck It's it's
evil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just gonna run these by since we're
winding down on yeah I was just looking
[SPEAKER_02]: these these were in the same bag with the
Cali mist and the bubble gum and stuff I
[SPEAKER_02]: actually was able recently to send a bunch
of these back old Spice of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some old legend seeds actually my
my last pack of the Johnny Blaze that
[SPEAKER_02]: people were mentioning I finally got to
get those back in the hands of red who
[SPEAKER_02]: made them and So I think red might be
making some new versions of the old legend
[SPEAKER_02]: seat stuff soon So people that were
interested in those you might actually
[SPEAKER_00]: come back to fruition Legends was a good
was a good company from for a while there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a bunch of good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Reds reds the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Like that guy a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do you want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to do some quick questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right Any that you saw that you want
to pick up on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, now you're gonna call me out and
make me remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if people are listening Ask
questions right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you have a dying question that you
have to ask Can you speak on the white
[SPEAKER_02]: lights?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's plant like?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it compare to the nl5?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do that real quick I also sent red
back some legends ultimate indica dookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also got the legends ultimate indica
for me Hawaiian lights is Oddly enough,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's more Afghani even than the nl5.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tends to be more broadly for an
expression We saw some bubble looking
[SPEAKER_02]: types in it that weren't bubble smelling,
but they were just the typical bubble
[SPEAKER_02]: structure Lots of resin production.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is some color in these lots of
tropical turps lots of pineapple Just all
[SPEAKER_02]: through the the tropical range Trying to
think of what the best way to describe
[SPEAKER_02]: that is but it's really hard tropical
tropical basically tropical Afghani and
[SPEAKER_02]: that is essentially what Hawaiian lights
comes out like Very variant, but they all
[SPEAKER_02]: are pretty much broadleaf So yeah,
that's that's the Hawaiian lights in a
[SPEAKER_02]: nutshell.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have Caleb come on and talk more
about it soon We're gonna be dropping the
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe this weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna do my best I've been packaging a
bunch trying to get through all the
[SPEAKER_02]: packages in order So once those are done,
then I'll add in the Hawaiian lights
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid So keep your eyes posted on right
tico calm and humbled CSI calm for both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the Couple there's a bunch of
questions out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there was some stuff on leather
turps The a5 and some of the some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rare haze turps definitely have some
leather in them Animal and leather.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually kind of prefer that dark
profile to like the super bright fruity
[SPEAKER_00]: Turpentine type of thing on it You know,
there's there's haze lines available all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the trouble is just pulling out what
you want out of Them, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's an American leather is also a
motor Rebels harawana his version of Steve
[SPEAKER_02]: Tuck's harawana, which is very different
It's very there's a lot of leather in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone else just said it to ya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and there's There's you know,
there's some American seed companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't that are You know They're crossing
things to Cuban black and other haze
[SPEAKER_00]: things There's obviously some European
seed companies like Shanti Baba that have
[SPEAKER_00]: some stuff There's a big debate on what
he's lost and what he's had but You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can definitely get it seems like the
mango haze Is still really good from him
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's smaller breeders doing
smaller work on hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely is easier to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know if easier to get but
You know, there's there's good haze cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: out there that are starting to slip out a
little bit more wide You know that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing so, you know people were talking
about When did the first cookie pop out?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole show in itself,
but probably but probably like oh nine ish
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say I can't talk about
somebody mentioned the legitimacy of us
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott from rare Danks Neville's haze
couldn't tell you just no idea You know
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's haze has been for sale for a
long time if you use Neville's haze from
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville couldn't tell you what era was
from No information on that as far as that
[SPEAKER_00]: goes but You know You know, there's big
debates people talk about newer newer
[SPEAKER_00]: releases of Shanti stuff don't have that
People always get that way Sometimes I
[SPEAKER_00]: wonder if it doesn't have that or just you
found it in one or two packs and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: go through five or six More packs looking
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, is it in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you just not see at that time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, did the luck of the draw not pop up,
you know because it's it's a it's a super
[SPEAKER_00]: bitch to find one that you want Purple
haze was a super famous haze from the
[SPEAKER_00]: original Haze lines from America,
you know, they kind of said they said they
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of bred it out on accident It was
actually magenta haze on the poster now
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Jenta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, you know You know, so the problem
with haze is that it's hard to find
[SPEAKER_00]: keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rare But there is a bunch of interest
in it all of a sudden in the last two or
[SPEAKER_00]: three years and so that's gotten some
American breeders collecting cuts and
[SPEAKER_00]: making hybrids You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just just be prepared to hunt through some
jungle weed and You know and don't don't
[SPEAKER_00]: let you know, we should mention we should
mention that if we're talking about jungle
[SPEAKER_00]: weed, there is a super famous cut of NL
five haze a I think in Holland and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: called dr. Grinspoon It's it's called
quays motherfucker quake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, whatever quays dr. Grinspoon I'm
just gonna say most people probably know
[SPEAKER_02]: it is one of the other it's not the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, anyway quays call it quays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so The point I was trying to make is
when you watch this thing grow It's a
[SPEAKER_00]: million little calyxes like this fucking
big It's like the kind of thing where 99%
[SPEAKER_00]: of growers would cut that shit halfway
through right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it produces a million Little one
hitter type bong ribs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but the weed off it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so if you're growing haze Don't go
by looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, wait until you can smoke it and see
what the effect is and see what the taste
[SPEAKER_00]: is Yeah, because some of the shittiest
looking weed imaginable And I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: ugly like like like haze is not IG
photogenic No, there's a lot of ugly haze
[SPEAKER_00]: brown Shitty fucking growth hairy looking
but then you smoke it and it tears your
[SPEAKER_00]: head off and it tastes delicious And
you're happy and giggling and life is
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so you really have to make sure
don't don't give up early Because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what everybody does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I I bloomed out the quays didn't
keep cuts I was like, what's this shit and
[SPEAKER_00]: I did pollinate it but I was like Nick I
mean, you know Neville even talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: like his favorite female He blooms it out
and it took 20 weeks and he thought it was
[SPEAKER_00]: the hairy Ugliest never finishing piece of
shit ever and he cut it down He hung it in
[SPEAKER_00]: a corner and he killed the mom and then a
month later He made some hash out of it He
[SPEAKER_00]: said it was some of the best weed he'd
ever smoked in his life and he still
[SPEAKER_00]: regretted losing it Yeah, but by looks it
was the ugliest piece of shit he'd ever
[SPEAKER_00]: seen Yeah You know, so you can't judge
haze haze is not cookie haze is not
[SPEAKER_00]: photogenic He's what you're going for with
haze is taste and effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, it's gonna be a gnarly big
Ugly plant you could get some pretty ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not impossible But don't give up if
it looks hideous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's only a few people I've seen
make pure haze look photogenic and very
[SPEAKER_00]: very few Yeah and then on top of that
What's gonna happen more often than not is
[SPEAKER_00]: that ugly piece of shit that you held on
to that you had dreams for?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was gonna be it isn't it and then
it's just an ugly piece of shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, yeah Because that happened to me
quite a bit too, you know It's like I've
[SPEAKER_00]: filed this Neville's haze and it takes me
fucking forever to do it and it's like 14
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 whatever weeks And then I'm like,
oh, I don't want to keep it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, I will I will say like I
never really rocked rare date with stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: just because the guy was a dick to me,
but a Lot of people do like the moonshine
[SPEAKER_02]: haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to smoke it once at one of the
Denver cannabis cups at some Mad ball or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember who was playing but it
was some punk rock show and it was it was
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty good Not gonna lie even as biased
as I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty good for a fucking haze I
think we each did a good job on the
[SPEAKER_00]: moonshine if you limit Your seeds to only
people you think you like you're really
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting your seeds in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, very much so You know,
sometimes weirdos and and assholes and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they pop out fire Yeah,
you know, yeah, I don't even know dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm not even dissing him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that yeah, yeah that It's
tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes haze tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough to find and so it's cool that
people are trying to make like more
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible hazes and then it's kind of
gaining in popularity again, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: from some of these smaller seed companies
and people trying to pump it in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: because That'll keep it alive You need
periodic booms of interest To keep things
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, you really said when I was
selling pith.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wanted it and now it's very in
demand I wish I would have sat on those
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds Frozen, you know till now but that's
not how shit works Yeah, I was I was
[SPEAKER_00]: joking about rare skunk one the other
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know 15 years ago You couldn't
give skunk away.
[SPEAKER_00]: No couldn't you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the companies put free skunk one
or skunk haze or skunk whatever hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: one hybrids out there Yeah, cuz they just
had so much They just had so many stock
[SPEAKER_00]: and they never sold any so you might as
well make people happy and throw in four
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds Yeah Now people are like,
well, maybe there's some secret sauce in
[SPEAKER_00]: this old skunk one That I can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah the secret skunky smells,
you know, you'd have a lot better luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope hunting for something secret and haze
Yeah, then you would and skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure don't one you people have
probably pushed it to its limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Hayes, there's still surprises and
people asked I should just remember
[SPEAKER_00]: because it popped into my head people
asked about the band-aid haze 7 Yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: cuz that's a cut that floats around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that people I respect like yo
Sammy in Europe and others have told me
[SPEAKER_00]: they view that cut as Equal to the old
cuts that they hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the first haze in a long time that
they feel is as good and stands right
[SPEAKER_00]: there with those old 25 30 year old
strains that have been kept forever That's
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting and it's a lot more accessible
to people Yeah in you know in America than
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of these other ones that I talk
about these things are I should mention
[SPEAKER_00]: people think I'm connected or whatever and
I had been fucking hunting all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: European haze cuts since the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know and it it was like the white
rabbit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like multi decades of looking Yeah,
and there's still some like that Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: pays cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that thing so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Know where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get it You know, if it's in
America, I don't know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, but anyway, the band-aid
haze 7 is an amazing cut amazing Effect
[SPEAKER_00]: they're growing it over in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to get in America than the
rest of them Yeah, it does take forever,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so be prepared to go 14 weeks or
whatever But it's a it's a fire cut by all
[SPEAKER_00]: accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I believe that's Cuban black
haze cross to a five tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Believe so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, whatever Cuban black is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah was so whatever so it's Possible that
you know, it's that it's it's a c5 cut by
[SPEAKER_00]: an a5 cut by some a tie male to bird eye
pollen Maybe maybe yeah, but whatever case
[SPEAKER_00]: may be There's a cut you can still buy
band-aid hay seeds There's various
[SPEAKER_00]: versions of them and there's at least this
one cut that came out elite status Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the people that have been running a
lot of these hazes for 30 years if they
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's as good as the rest of them You
know, that's pretty hyper Raise from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah adoptees doing a lot of work that
he's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know Yeah, we did talk about Tom
Hill just in in brief Not very not for
[SPEAKER_00]: very long you know, but Tom Hill did
release did have Tom Hill haze and did
[SPEAKER_00]: have Tom hate Tom Hill haze by deep chunk
and Maybe some other more work around
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I believe all of his stuff
descends from positronics haze line Fuzz
[SPEAKER_02]: around is kind of saying that you're wrong
about a5 and c5 not existing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he's confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they don't exist Yeah, they definitely
what I'm saying is that there's there's
[SPEAKER_00]: various haze cuts that I know are alive in
Europe And I don't know if they're alive
[SPEAKER_00]: here Yeah, there's a five and c5 that have
popped up in America and there's a number
[SPEAKER_00]: of people that have them There's still
politics around releasing seed around it
[SPEAKER_00]: or trading It or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're still tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're alive some of them I should to
be said some of them have Some of them
[SPEAKER_00]: have the virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so be careful Yeah, I haven't run
the SSC hazes someone's asking about but
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good thing to mention because one
of the things that's interesting is almost
[SPEAKER_00]: all the haze that's available is Based off
of Neville's work, which is a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right or Symposium work or whatever
but Neville's seems to be the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody found fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and when we interviewed Correll
Correll had a They had a and it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: confirmed by friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a 35 plus year old skunk haze Yeah,
that he made from haze seeds given to him
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and what's interesting about if you
were to get correll's work and cross it to
[SPEAKER_00]: some of Neville's work is That it's not
Neville's males Yeah, it's another genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: of haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So it's not quite the same
bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep whatsoever You know because haze
doesn't like being crossed to itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and it's from that same batch of seed
that Neville got You know, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I didn't really realize that until we
talked to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was a mindblower But his SSC
hybrids off that skunk haze should be a
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different haze that's been
available up until recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but from this Same seeds from the
same era I I'm gonna be really excited
[SPEAKER_02]: with some new outdoor space to finally run
some of my haze collection and other ships
[SPEAKER_02]: don't Finally get to pop the SSC stuff
because I've really wanted to Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I mean there's I don't know I could I
could try to you know at the end of it I
[SPEAKER_00]: could try to Nate, you know, there's
There's dog shit and the caught we haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about the Colorado cough No didn't
talk about the cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cough is another I think we did an nl5
haze episode though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you know There's cough there's dog
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Cuban black Dutch treat Dutch
treat Sweet skunk from Europe from Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: has a bunch of nl5 haze in it Or is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know at least in its original form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a bunch of American cuts that
float around There's eight or ten Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts that float around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that all adds up to But
what's great is that it seems like from
[SPEAKER_00]: from a line that was available in the 90s
Yeah, there's the stew which is one that I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't actually somebody mentioned that I
know I don't know that I know of the stew
[SPEAKER_00]: the stew is an old As another old nl5 haze
from the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never actually grown it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been one of those rumors That I hear
about okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard stories of the stew I've talked
to people that I trust that have talked
[SPEAKER_00]: About the stew I've never seen this do
I've never like is it kind of like disco
[SPEAKER_02]: stew in the Simpsons?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like the deep rubbed off his jacket.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was the stud in this do I almost
want to say people might get me wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's like it's uh The stew might be
from Jersey or something close somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: in that New York region Okay, and it's old
but I but I don't know anything about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is it is another suppose an nl5
haze cut That and and island sweet skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: is a little different than sweet skunk and
then Mark Emory did this thing You know
[SPEAKER_00]: that confused the lineage of it But as far
as we can tell there is a real There is a
[SPEAKER_00]: real sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was basically mostly nl5 haze yeah,
and it got cross did did did Steve cross
[SPEAKER_00]: it to like grapefruit or something or
yeah, I don't know what it was crossed
[SPEAKER_00]: here so You know anyway, um The you know
fork, you know, so it's it's cool in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense that there's a bunch of different
phenos Yeah that have survived You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um all females obviously we don't have any
I don't you know People are asking me
[SPEAKER_00]: where could you get real nl5 haze male
pollen and I think that might be lost of
[SPEAKER_02]: time Yeah, we have one of our buddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kim Blackburn is is a part of the cough
group So we have people closer to the
[SPEAKER_02]: cough that they know the history of It
real well, so I'll probably bring him on
[SPEAKER_02]: at some point working man to talk about it
He's a cough fanatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and he's got he knows he knows the
story pretty well I mean, there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some still confusion about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was cough one and there was cough
two in Colorado Yeah, I used to smoke the
[SPEAKER_00]: cough in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had really good friends of mine I grew
up with it and ended up moving out to
[SPEAKER_00]: Boulder in the mid 90s and I used to go
out there all the time and that's where I
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoked that sandalwood tasting ak-47.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah And some of those other famous 90s
Colorado strains But yeah, the cough
[SPEAKER_00]: exists The New York stuff exists
strawberry cough is much different I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know the origins of strawberry coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what I know what Cushman says I
know that it is exactly like earth beer
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's turps and has a lot of the
similar Traits to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like some strawberry filled haze For
whatever that's worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and the cough, you know the cough
Basically like got famous in Fort Collins,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think it came from Connecticut I
don't want to misspeak but our buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: working man knows like the people Involved
and like the people that brought it to
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado from there and all that different
types of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it definitely is You know, yeah,
you never know the dog shit the dog shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wish still had its original name
Its original name is right up there with
[SPEAKER_00]: Western winds is one of my favorites the
dog shit Minneapolis was called electric
[SPEAKER_02]: boogaloo, yeah, you know, it sucks is like
I was doing the labels for the The dog
[SPEAKER_02]: shit cross to the Hawaiian lights and I
was like, I just wanted to put electric
[SPEAKER_02]: boogaloo, but I know Most people won't
even associate that with the dog shit cut
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll just sit there, you know,
yeah You know, it'll just sit there but
[SPEAKER_00]: but electric boogaloo is like one of the
all-time great names Yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it Someone was asking about the
primary pop belong to there's it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have we still have good friends
that grow the cough That we talk to all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So luckily the cough is alive and well You
know, there's there's haze in Florida that
[SPEAKER_00]: got shipped in New York, you know,
there's crews of Cubans down there There's
[SPEAKER_00]: crews of Cubans and Dominicans in New York
that run it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's you know, he's having cabin fever.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's totally incorrect It was what I was
just talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fucking mad farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had nothing to do with that cut It was
a cut out of blue sky cafe Originally and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was made by lion something farms You
can still find the info on icy mag way
[SPEAKER_02]: back when he made it long before mad
farmer came to this and it's an ath gooey
[SPEAKER_02]: cross deep chunk It is not strawberry
cough deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just relabeled by blue sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go One of the things I should say
about one of the things that draws people
[SPEAKER_00]: to haze is that we live in an Indica
dominant It's like the exact opposite of
[SPEAKER_00]: the 70s and 80s Where excuse me where
Sativa ruled the game?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we live in an Indica and Indica
dominant scene Yeah, and haze is a tie
[SPEAKER_00]: back to that ancient You know no longer
available import and it seems like it
[SPEAKER_00]: gives people a better high in a different
way It has a different high profile it
[SPEAKER_00]: hits people and even if people are
extremely used to and Experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking chems or you know, oh geez or
whatever you can smoke some haze and have
[SPEAKER_00]: it hit you like a brick So even though
it's ugly and takes a long time and has
[SPEAKER_00]: these various issues It's popular for my
favorite reason for weed to be popular
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah It works good, you know, so that's
the best reason to like weed weed that
[SPEAKER_00]: works You know Yeah, so All right,
