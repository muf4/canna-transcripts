[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_01]: clan-destined scene through the eyes of
the folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-so-Dodd, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we might start with
is just sort of like, we keep getting
[SPEAKER_00]: questions on, you know, we talk a lot
about on various shows and it's certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: a big thing on Instagram and other places
of media of like, how many different
[SPEAKER_00]: directions the scene is going that we
don't like.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we've so we've spent a
bunch of time talking about like various
[SPEAKER_00]: effects and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people keep suggesting,
well, what if we talked about things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we could do or, you know, on that level or
something constructive, something
[SPEAKER_00]: constructive perhaps or something that
like even someone who's not very connected
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever on any level could accomplish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that like that resonated with me
pretty good because it is it is better to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about constructive things,
you know, than it is to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's important to like discuss the
problem so people know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it's like it can it can
definitely seem insurmountable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now is a really easy time for it
to feel insurmountable when there's so
[SPEAKER_03]: many different problems coming at cannabis
in general from so many different
[SPEAKER_03]: directions as we see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I kind of do this thing
fairly often on the discord where I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: throw I'll throw out some questions for
everybody to see what they want to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, sometimes people come up
with some pretty good some pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: angles on things on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might delve into that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, how to how to change
things, where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think maybe what's really happening
is that any time, you know, people really
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't adapted to fast change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been a lot of changes happening
really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it makes people's heads spin
to some degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's happening fast enough that,
like, you know, I don't know if you think
[SPEAKER_00]: this way, Matt, but it's almost like every
year or two is like a different scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially now where that like that maybe
took like five or 10 years for like things
[SPEAKER_00]: to like seem dramatically different on any
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so great big strange changes and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like strange, you know, strains that got
popular had a longer had a longer like
[SPEAKER_00]: runtime of popularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the laws change slower,
you know, pricing and just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of things that just seemed a
little bit more stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now everything's kind of rapid fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's rapid fire change and that makes
people uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are people are talking about
there's a bunch of stuff going on like
[SPEAKER_00]: right now on the Internet of like,
you know, the community is trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out like, well, who can you part
with all these changes going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is ethical?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's for the for something that's been
black market and illicit and clandestine
[SPEAKER_03]: for so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: Things that weren't OK before that would
get you blacklisted may not be the same
[SPEAKER_03]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, and some of that is just some
of that is just changing culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I don't want to be like
old man yells at cloud, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, because changes change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes you know, there's different
forces now than there used to be.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and maybe the best way to put it
in a nutshell is that like before all the
[SPEAKER_00]: forces against us were pretty much in
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a large degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've even been giving this some some
thought because there's people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting roasted now for some of the people
they're partnering with and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're fighting back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I even think to some degree,
like maybe the way that people fight back
[SPEAKER_00]: against those people like Matt,
even for somebody like you, who like it
[SPEAKER_00]: used to be very effective to call somebody
out in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know if that's even the
most effective path anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't think it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's hard sometimes for people who
have a past of doing that constantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you know, one way to handle
certain situations.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think now it really is a lot of
beating your head against the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people are throwing out the names
and stuff like that that's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what it's really exposing
is that, you know, there's there's never
[SPEAKER_00]: been like this uber ethical time in weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed's always been full of shady
characters, you know, for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was criminal in various regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so some people, you know,
some people were in it just because they
[SPEAKER_00]: felt like that was silly and they loved
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, some people are in it
because they are criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that was just another
criminal shit to do or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people are in it for rep and
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people are in it for money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in it for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wants to say they're in it for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's a good thing to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good talking point, but it isn't
necessarily true for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what people are noticing is by
people's associations now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're starting to realize,
well, like, where do those ethics lie?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's and it's gone back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Matt, Matt remembers even like
when Colorado first went legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was people in Colorado that should
remain nameless that got into battles with
[SPEAKER_00]: buddies of ours about like, well,
you know, go legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't, then you're unfair
competition and it's not even snitching or
[SPEAKER_00]: ratting to like get you gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're just untaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not paying the same dues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am like, you're refusing to take the
path.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was like a massive split in
the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a very big turning point in the
community when, when it became possible to
[SPEAKER_03]: snitch people out to med boards and not
necessarily the police.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at what point is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, or, or doxing or they're
just a, just a variety of pressure tactics
[SPEAKER_00]: to get people off their back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of times, you know,
really what it boils down to is there's
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are making all kinds of
choices about their own personal future
[SPEAKER_00]: and their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, like when they get
exposed, they don't want to be exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: because they feel like that might hurt
their customer base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or seed sales potentially, which could
hurt their ability to partner with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these people because they have to be
useful to these bigger powers and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, so there's an aspect now where
it's like, there's a lot of, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of secret snitching.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of doxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of like through proxies or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and how, so kind of what's happened
is now is like the community has sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: lost the ability to police itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even believe that word,
but it's like now people are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's acceptable to work with
police.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, and be like, oh,
this, you know, and, and, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, that, that's about as 180
degrees C change as you can possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're, again, we're, we're
discussing issues now, but really what it
[SPEAKER_00]: boils down to is, so I look at it and I,
I talk about it in my head and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about this a lot, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where my whole life, they've been telling
me for, in regards to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's, it's bad for you to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've all been fighting in this,
in this community, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the overgrown overgrow was named right for
people that don't know the first real weed
[SPEAKER_00]: forum overgrow was named because the
concept was overgrow the government.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if too many people start growing and
so many people start disobeying and people
[SPEAKER_00]: refuse to respect the law, then eventually
they'll have to change the law so that
[SPEAKER_00]: people keep respect for other laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was like the whole, that was like
the whole theory, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, was, you know, was overgrow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now we have that comes from,
um, Warner or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're, um, uh, uh, keys.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, uh, uh, he's Hawker poker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of my friends might chime
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure it's old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was him and we're not yellow.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: His big thing was to get a bunch of hemp
plants, give them out for free hemp clones
[SPEAKER_03]: and say overgrow the government.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's how we're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm keeping away all the hemp plants
before, uh, before 1996 when California
[SPEAKER_00]: actually passed proposition to 15,
which was the first medical in the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the first place to take it from
totally illegal to like a path towards
[SPEAKER_00]: like, like you can call it a gray area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember when they used to push for
like, to get like hundreds of thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: hippies to move to Wyoming?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was so, lightly populated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could probably affect the vote and
people were trying to figure out,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, what state can we actually get some
movement?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What state can we actually get something?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've overgrown to the point where
people are looking around at prices,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and how to survive and all the various
things that are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like, maybe, man, maybe we over
grew a bit too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that aspect, that price dive,
that worry that we talk about,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's caused a lot of people to look
around and, and, and, and choices are
[SPEAKER_00]: being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are mentioning certain choices
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when we're talking about choices,
uh, you can go back to even the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the rollup of, of how it worked and how
the community reacted when we saw things
[SPEAKER_03]: like icy mag and heaven stairway get taken
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was mentioning shebang.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that was one of the people that
got taken down for, um, I believe running
[SPEAKER_03]: icy mag and heaven stairway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after that, when that happened,
was that oh five somewhere?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I see Mac was late, but heaven
stairway is right about five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't, I mean, haven't stairway that
got like cannabis world and overgrown
[SPEAKER_00]: taken down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's all part of the same bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all part of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that happened, I got scared enough of
the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly didn't really start poking
around again until social media really
[SPEAKER_00]: came back on in the mid teens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was scared off it for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I got scared off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see bag once the cops see the servers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, and usually, um, yeah, she bang is
actually there, there's paperwork right
[SPEAKER_03]: now and he's in, he's in trial.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, he, he did get busted,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that he got busted with the server
and, and top cops don't tend to give
[SPEAKER_03]: servers back when they take them either.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people need to keep that in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, so there's an aspect of,
um, you know, people are asking,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, what can we do to change things
positively?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, there, there's an aspect
where they're, I'm not, I'm not big on
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioning, names on the show or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of comments going on,
but obviously like, there's a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: going on recently on IG and, and,
you know, people are talking about like
[SPEAKER_00]: associations that people are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, you can, you can vote with
your wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to try to hide their work
and off in different brands and different
[SPEAKER_00]: this and different that you can figure out
who they are and you can not spend your
[SPEAKER_00]: money on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They essentially need an enormous amount
of consumer money to stay afloat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all doing this because they think
this is the best money play for
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way to hurt them is to,
is to deny that money play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the, you know, you can, so,
you know, maybe, maybe I'll continue my
[SPEAKER_00]: thought or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my whole life, they can't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're at this point where they're
like, man, this thing's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we'll take it from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, the fight hasn't changed really
the fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has just shifted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to fight for access and
acceptance.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the big fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Access, acceptance and the ability to do
that without getting in trouble just
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a plant that's fucking
stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're kind of getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made, we've made way faster
expansion on access and safety and the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think within a number of years,
a lot of these like piss testing for jobs
[SPEAKER_00]: will go away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there was something announced
today about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure actually, but it's going to
go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to go away soon because so many
States are led to making it legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to, you know, and then
wide varieties of people are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to start using it without penalty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has something to do with jobs,
not being able to discriminate in legal
[SPEAKER_03]: States where there's medical cannabis and
yeah, they're not allowed to discriminate
[SPEAKER_03]: against legal cannabis, if I remember
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so here's the gig when it,
as it shifts from like safety and freedom
[SPEAKER_00]: and access, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the right to do so now it's going to
shift to like who controls it,
[SPEAKER_00]: who sells it to you, like who,
you know, like that really who controls
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it probably will be a fight that we're
battling, but what people have to remember
[SPEAKER_00]: it's dark days right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like a lot of people that are
like deeply in the cannabis industry are
[SPEAKER_00]: hurting pretty bad, which is why I think
it's causing some of these desperate
[SPEAKER_00]: movements.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that when it comes down to it,
there's people that like, they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive, they want to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they have to deal with the devil,
they will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would like to throw out there that,
you know, when it comes down to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are winning, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that the fight has shifted,
you know, like we were fighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's we that's winning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, in the sense that like,
you know, imagine 15 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you thought that like 38 or 40 States
in America would allow recreational or
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cancers.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's more access for more people
now than ever before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not happy with the direction the
scene is going, but that's because our
[SPEAKER_00]: previous goal, we were all pretty united
on we want this thing to be available and
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible and not get people in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to be able to smoke and share
weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have is like, so what we have
going on right now is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have a six plant limit for in your
state, you basically can't breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't keep mom stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have a normal amount of plants
that even a hobbyist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this to me, this is where the term
legal legalization was bastardized and a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of uneducated because even when I was
15, even when I was 15, I knew that once
[SPEAKER_03]: corporations got their hands dug in deep
enough to be able to take over
[SPEAKER_03]: immediately, that's when they're going to
flip the bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even as a 15 year old kid, I realized
that's how the world works.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how corporations work.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did not expect them to push it under
the guise of legalization because even
[SPEAKER_03]: today, any, any average citizen who
doesn't grow, but smokes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you ask them, if weed is legal,
they're going to tell you yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: 99% of the time they're going to tell you
yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't even know what's happening
to the real grower side of the aspect that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's nothing legal about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're making it legal in the sense to
possess or whatever, but you still have to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to approve stores and buy it from
approved vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we both know that invites
corruption at all these different levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so strangely, and this might be like
from a capitalist perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: this might be one of the first cases that
I know of of this, where it's like the
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization of something led to a massive
drop in quality and a massive increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: price.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about the massive increase in
price with the drop in quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a hard one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, well, I mean, there's think
about how many people are buying like 70
[SPEAKER_00]: and $80 eighths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And think about how expensive all that
stuff is now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, there's, there's plenty of
cheap too, but it's like the taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I saw that thing where you know,
they broke down like how much,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much an eighth is and like the farmer
gets three bucks and the tax man gets 21
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks and the, and the, and the Dispo gets
20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the fricking, you know,
dispensary gets 40 bucks and you end up
[SPEAKER_00]: paying 80 bucks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it's that that is
preposterous.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like three layers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the government, there's the
distribution and there's the store and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all, you know, pillaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they can, I paid attention when I
was a kid, I watched that movie of Robin
[SPEAKER_03]: Hood and I remember there was a sheriff of
Nottingham and I remember they would bug
[SPEAKER_03]: people for money and I kept that with me
growing up and I was like, wow,
[SPEAKER_03]: this tax thing is a scam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like at some level, at some level,
the way it works now, this is we've all
[SPEAKER_03]: been conditioned to think that this is
what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I agreed to have society.
[SPEAKER_00]: People need to pitch in, but what I think
has happened is like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's one of those things where
anytime they, any kind of vice becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: more acceptable, they want to give money
to cops in schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're just like, well, you know,
here's funding for various groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to tax the shit out of
this vice or whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to appease the other
voting house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, they, they made taxes based
probably on like a much higher pound price
[SPEAKER_00]: than people are getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, so it's not really,
so that's really what's happened is like
[SPEAKER_00]: in the two 15 era, anybody could grow
whatever they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they had a medical card and they
grew good enough weed, they could walk
[SPEAKER_00]: into a medical dispensary and they could
make a deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allowed a wide variety of things
to proliferate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one of the, one of the aspects of
the person that's getting shit talked a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of this week is that not only are
people upset at like the, the associations
[SPEAKER_00]: that he's making, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But he, but it, you know, a lot of the
genetics that people, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he sold his genetics for a high dollar and
they were, and there was a nurse reaction
[SPEAKER_00]: and there was a lot of disease and viroid
involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of viroid, which we will be doing a
show September 8th about the hop late and
[SPEAKER_03]: viroid and everything you'd ever want to
know inside out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to try to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's, it's a, it's the new,
you know, with all it takes is poor
[SPEAKER_00]: practices at a facility and especially at
a nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not, and a lack of care and spending
on testing and you can nuke, you can spend
[SPEAKER_00]: so many gardens and get infected.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had friends who have lost whole
collections time and time again because of
[SPEAKER_03]: this virus, because it's not really,
or by right, because it's not easy to
[SPEAKER_03]: clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, you know, that's a,
that's a, that's a product to be honest of
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization, but without proper
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, on a certain level,
it's like, you know, using, using razor
[SPEAKER_00]: blades on multiple plants is sort of like
using tattoo needles on multiple customers
[SPEAKER_00]: or junkies share needles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same gig.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, unless it's sterilized in
between or you use a fresh one for the
[SPEAKER_00]: next, like it's, it's gotta be kind of
that kind of, of, of environment now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's written it, you know,
and so there's another reason to not
[SPEAKER_03]: forget to buy seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should not let the seed industry die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, that's, that's another
thing is that maybe one, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: my comments have totally frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen, I haven't seen any new
comments in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people are typing stuff in,
it's like for the last five minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just not done jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize if I'm not seeing anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there's, it used to be that
the two 15 era and sort of the gray market
[SPEAKER_00]: era, allowed a lot of capitalistic
activity, allowed a lot of small
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses, allowed a lot of garage size
growers, independent breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, various types, you know,
pretty low bar to entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and now that that's all getting,
now that that's all getting like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, legalized or whatever else,
it's barring entry to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I do think, I do think that
the, I do think that all the public
[SPEAKER_00]: commentary this week calling out certain
people, is one of the better ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, someone asked, well, how do you
educate the public?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of it is like, just like the stuff
that we're doing right now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we do, we do a show that's not like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not all about us or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try to talk about different,
different aspects of the weed industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: different content and some history and
different things, because educating people
[SPEAKER_00]: is the best way to get people on your
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talk about Matt with Matt all the
time about this, where it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we really have to like build a
coalition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going, it's going to be political in
a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a syndicate as the case may be,
but we have to, we have to build a
[SPEAKER_00]: syndicate of like-minded people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can be pretty diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the important part is that we don't
want to eliminate a ton of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to like have a general set of
goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be all-inclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, whether, whether you're
politics or you're this or you're that,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, you got to be,
relatively accepting of people that share
[SPEAKER_00]: those same basic goals.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, those basic goals are like,
not only do I want weed to be legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to be easily accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to be high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want people to be able to do what
they want with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like, you know, I know that
you rolled your eyes for a second when I
[SPEAKER_00]: said, oh, we're winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a sense, you know, because it does
feel like for cannabis industry people,
[SPEAKER_00]: it does feel like a pretty dark time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of change happening fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pricing, which used to like fuel the
insurgency, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, there's an aspect where
it's like, it was so hard for anybody to
[SPEAKER_00]: beat the Taliban.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they had a bunch of heroin in the
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were able to fund their shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when prices were higher,
the insurgency in America, as far as like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, weed rights or whatever was,
was better funded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the price falls apart and various
things, a lot of people start to struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, the side benefit is a
lot more people get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the coalition can get way,
way, way bigger than it ever was before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be scary for all of us,
like who depend on it solely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because change is scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so what it boils down to is the reason
why I said we're winning is because for
[SPEAKER_00]: half my life, they told me we couldn't
have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they want to steal it from us,
but they weren't successful in preventing
[SPEAKER_00]: anything we wanted to do before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we had to battle them for a
long time to eventually get to where we
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't view it per, I don't view it
all that much different than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like the goals and the,
and the idea has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going from like, like access and,
and freedom and not being jailed and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that to like, now we get to choose like,
well, how do we want weed to look?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we want it to be like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, you know, so there's, there's an
aspect of it where it's like, I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: people have had access to most,
except there's a couple of people on here
[SPEAKER_00]: who disagree, but there's a, most people
have access to pretty good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Dicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some, uh, there's some,
uh, there's, you know, there's some people
[SPEAKER_00]: sadly that have been exposed to a bunch of
jank, if you will, and are unhappy with
[SPEAKER_00]: their access to weed, but lots of people's
access to weed has gotten much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clone trading is easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you don't have, I mean,
I don't like clone sellers all that much
[SPEAKER_00]: to some degree, but to be honest,
like if you, it might be a lot of people's
[SPEAKER_00]: only way to get at certain things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's available and it's out there and
it's like, it's not, it's not,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, you can build a collection now
with some money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have finances, you can at
least be given the illusion that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: getting something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, and in some ways that's more,
that could be, that could be as satisfying
[SPEAKER_00]: as waiting around to get into the right
groups for years and years before you
[SPEAKER_00]: start getting some access to some of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though it's negative in some ways,
there's positive in other ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: because my whole goal with weed is,
uh, more people smoking better weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, people are talking about,
I can barely find weed without the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fair because really,
I mean, we were, we're, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: jump around, I guess a little bit if we
start talking about that, but basically
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Instagram, we like to get into a
lot of petty fights with one another.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there might even be someone that like,
you know, has participated in a petty
[SPEAKER_00]: fight every now and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are, are good natured and
good hearted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are a little bit more,
you know, but we, we, but we got to pick
[SPEAKER_00]: our battles because it's like,
you know, uh, you might be battling with
[SPEAKER_00]: someone, but like both of you were like,
well, I'm not, I don't believe in working
[SPEAKER_00]: with cops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this consensus, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, you know, we want a consensus of
better weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell a story for a second,
because there there's an aspect of this
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think is the truth is, you know,
when, um, when we made alcohol illegal,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, with the, with the, whatever amendment
it was, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for a bunch of time, only the,
only the mob and everybody else ran
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was so much drinking and so
much lawlessness around it that they
[SPEAKER_00]: basically repealed it because it was
better to have it legal than illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They over grew over drank.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were, they didn't over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they were seeing a lot of tax
dollars go out the side and yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so, but then there's an
aspect, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, um, for the next like 50 or 60
years after they legalized it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they forced them a bunch of shit beer on
America near beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, you know, it was like when I,
when I wasn't just even in the nineties,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was going to bars in Chicago,
like the nicest beer was Heineken.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if during prohibition alcohol got
cheaper when it was legalized or if it got
[SPEAKER_03]: more expensive at the quality,
I guess you're, I guess there was a bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what I'm basically saying is
that it broke the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It broke the relationship to quality for a
while, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Decades even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody could choose between Coors
or Michelob or Budweiser or old style or
[SPEAKER_00]: fricking, you know, Keystone or,
you know, it was all cheap shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: Pilsners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was this like revolution
that happened, which was basically like
[SPEAKER_00]: people deciding, well, what if we just
brew good beer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micro breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, um, you know, the Budweiser,
Budweiser makes half the barrels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a Budweiser now that it did in
the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one of the biggest beer
companies in the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they ended up buying 15 or 18
micro brews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they want, they didn't want to
lose their micro, their, their share.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I mean by that is that what's
going to come is people are going to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to start selling really cheap,
really shitty weed for expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hoping that's your only option and you
just deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people don't know that there
are better options.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to these like,
you know, legal States or whatever that
[SPEAKER_00]: are, you know, that maybe some of them
don't have the greatest history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that some of the more fortunate States
do in terms of like large amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and access to really good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might've had, you know, Mexican or
bee sters or, you know, sort of a low
[SPEAKER_00]: grade of what comes from the better
States, you know, shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to push for, you have to
push for better weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because they're going to try to
sell you okay weed for high prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to vote with your dollars on
better weed, you know, and then if your
[SPEAKER_00]: doll, if you can't find better weed,
then grow your own and keep your dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: in your pocket and spend it on something
else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then eventually if enough
people don't buy shitty weed, they'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: a really hard time with shitty weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think that's such a utopian way of,
I mean, it's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you're saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is logic and it's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think it's such a utopian view to
hope that that will happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you the biggest supplier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's, let's put it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there, and here's the gig.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with that either,
because there's plenty of people out there
[SPEAKER_00]: that probably can't afford the quality of
weed that we like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they might have to get lesser
quality weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always going to be an existence of
the low quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or there could be some people that are
like, I'm fine with this weed and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to put it in a metal pipe with a
screen that I never clean and it gets me
[SPEAKER_00]: high and I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or mix it with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or mix it with tobacco or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's okay too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be some snob,
but what I'm saying is, is that like when
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, when I was a kid, okay,
the only way you could get organic food
[SPEAKER_00]: was like on dead tour or like crunchy
organic co-ops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and now there's whole foods and
there's all these high end stores and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's organic food in almost every
normal grocery store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people demanded a better grade and
they were willing to pay more for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now all of a sudden it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in the nineties, you could not
find organic food in a normal grocery
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are special stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fucking couldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to go find some hippie crunchy
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it existed and maybe it didn't,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, if you say, Oh,
we can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walmart's the biggest we can because we
did it with food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it wasn't just hippies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what people got to realize,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that hippies did not make organic food
a household name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yuppies did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hippies provided the basis, but there's
these fucking yuppies, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they look around and they're like,
I drive a European sports car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have Italian leather shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife is hot and gets plastic surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I make a lot of money a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a vacation home in Breckenridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I, why am I shopping at the same
place that everybody else shops?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want nicer food.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't think they're not going to want
fucking 120 day haze at some point?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the first places I saw organic
stuff popping up in California was places
[SPEAKER_03]: like Santa Barbara.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, like really well to do
areas in like beach communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started seeing lots of organic spots.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's, now it's spread everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, I mean, so there's,
there's enough people that are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: want high grade, good smoking weed to have
a huge market of high grade weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It don't, it doesn't have to be the whole
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it has to be enough of the
market to supply that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just want all craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, but, but the thing is,
is that like all those yuppies that I just
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned that did that to organic food,
when they, what do you, what kind of weed
[SPEAKER_00]: do you think they want to buy?
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is food is different than weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Food, food one is it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody eats food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everybody smokes weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's eaten food their whole life
and have experience with quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody has smoked weed their whole
life and has experience with quality to no
[SPEAKER_02]: quality when they're getting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you could see, I could see yuppies
buying $80 cookies, $80 in these baggies
[SPEAKER_03]: and thinking they're getting the supreme
quality and they can be, they can be
[SPEAKER_03]: confused into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we're going to see a lot of
that because they would have to search out
[SPEAKER_03]: the education.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't force education on these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to, it's going to take time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the organic food case, we're talking
over a 20 or 30 year period, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's going to be left in 20 or 30
years with weed and strains and all of
[SPEAKER_03]: these things that we're going to lose over
that 20 to 30 year period, because none of
[SPEAKER_03]: the people that run these grows that are
going to be able to survive and compete
[SPEAKER_03]: monetarily are going to be the ones
keeping these old strains with these
[SPEAKER_03]: special qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not trying to be, you know,
remember the, we're trying to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: theme as like, what can people do rather
than like give up hope and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not trying to, we're not trying to
drink bleach tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so the aspect is, is that there's
going to be a ton of people out there that
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That don't rely on weed entirely for their
income.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of people out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can save a few strains in their
collection as a hobbyist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are, there are people that can buy
one or two packs from their favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: readers and that, and that adds up like,
you know, when, when I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: food in the nineties, think about like all
these heirloom vegetables that just popped
[SPEAKER_00]: out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were maintained by like a dedicated
group of traders and like, and enthusiasts
[SPEAKER_00]: without very much, without very much money
in it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the risk is, is that they,
their shit wasn't highly regulated and
[SPEAKER_00]: taxed and illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, they could grow fucking 45
different kinds of tomatoes in their
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard and trade it with all their
friends and mail it all over the place and
[SPEAKER_00]: trade seeds and no one gave a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't let us do that yet with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're making our job fucking harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're making it harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have a big, I have a big mom
collection, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's fearful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, we're still paying electric
bills from years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my fucking God, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't even want to talk about that,
but there's an aspect where there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's 215 people listening to
us right now or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If each person decided there's one or two
strains I love and I'm going to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure this one stays alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then thousands of people start to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then not everyone has to hold onto
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if a couple of people, if enough
people decide to hold onto the electric
[SPEAKER_00]: boogaloo and a couple of people decide to
fucking hold onto, you know, chem 91 and
[SPEAKER_00]: these people decide to hold onto some haze
and you know, I mean, honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that I don't lose shit,
cause I do lose shit is I try to find
[SPEAKER_00]: people that love certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, and these four or five,
these four or five things, they grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: they love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not asking them to hold onto anything
that they don't love, but they don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to lose it either.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in love with it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to have, you know, it's one of
the ways that deep that all these things
[SPEAKER_00]: survived, you know, and, and, you know,
and, and there's an aspect to it too,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I did this for a long time and now
all of a sudden a bunch of the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: I have is like in demand or whatever
because it's old and it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not that many people that have
held it that long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everyone on this thing has the ability
to do that to one or two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a constant thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when, when we were throwing our
little cantaluminati parties before COVID
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked everything up, you know,
I would mostly honestly guys, I would
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly grow one or two or three things for
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I'd have a section of the
greenhouse or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just like my heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hits dash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I probably brought, what did I bring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like probably 20 or 30 different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, I brought, we brought a
bunch, we brought a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: things for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then, so then, you know, it's like
trading amongst you and your friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke some of this good weed, try this
out, try this weird thing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a space for hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we want, if we want like,
we can't trust corporations, we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: trust cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't trust JBZ.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't trust fucking glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need these people to halt, to be like a
genetic library.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fair to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be diffused and independent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even if those people did save it,
they would save it to profit off it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like they'd give you fucking
access to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, Oh, how great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, there was a,
there was a question that somebody asked
[SPEAKER_00]: about the impact of tissue culture on
breeder markets and collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe I'll, maybe I'll jump into that
for just a second because we're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to name names here either, but Matt's lost
his, Matt lost a chunk of stuff once
[SPEAKER_00]: trusting in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an aspect where people are
offering all these fucking services,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're like, give me all of your
life's collection and let me hold onto it
[SPEAKER_00]: for you with no contracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the tissue culture, every single
one of those motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll bring it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get it healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just give me all your valuable stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hold onto it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and there's no, and so for,
for a collector like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that works off the honor system,
I have high suspicion that they would just
[SPEAKER_00]: take the collection and do whatever the
fuck they want with it and use it in
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever way monetized it the most for
themselves.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just lie and say, Oh,
they got it from someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, we didn't use your version.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So TC to me, TC is cool if you want to do
it yourself, but if you want to involve
[SPEAKER_00]: some like big backed corporation,
you know, or a company that doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: your best interests, you know,
or a company that doesn't have your best
[SPEAKER_00]: interests at heart with the way the legal
scene is around marijuana right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is not very enforceable and everyone
bends the rules every which way they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say like you would trust your
TC collection unless it was like your
[SPEAKER_00]: oldest homie and you had a lot of luck and
you really trusted them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if CS, if CSI opened up a nursery and
like had a, you know, our radio,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's various people that are
friends of ours that we trust.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but for the most part you're
turning your shit over to some stranger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't know them for many,
many years, it's a stranger.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even if you do, you're still,
I mean, most, yeah, it's always a risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a valuable thing to a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I joke about it with Matt and
some of my friends, but like in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: five or six years, every single person
that screwed me over has been a longterm
[SPEAKER_00]: friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the scene has gotten tougher,
people are making different ethical
[SPEAKER_00]: choices about how to stay alive and how to
keep their, their life safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, I don't trust TC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't trust, I don't trust the
collection to, to big entities right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not established enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like, you know, I just don't trust
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean I might not in the future,
like it might develop to the point where I
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to take a risk or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's an aspect where right now it's
just kind of wild, wild west and like in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just think they're offering to do it
because you have something of value.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, a case in point, and I'm not going to
name any names, but with the TC situation,
[SPEAKER_03]: this wasn't my experience, but I was
involved a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are examples of people taking
someone's dotted plant and to,
[SPEAKER_03]: to clean them up Maristem wise,
putting it off for six months with
[SPEAKER_03]: promises.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, it's going, it's going good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know, a lot of us don't know how
long this takes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a new thing when this was
happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then returning a tiny, tiny,
tiny little clone and telling them,
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's tissue culture and it still does
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen, and this isn't even the same
person we were talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many examples of new
technologies coming to cannabis and
[SPEAKER_03]: finding ways to take advantage of,
of people who have these collections and
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That person might've paid $4,000 to get
that thing Maristem.
[SPEAKER_03]: That person paid $5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: $5,000 to get it Maristem with no,
with no like refund or proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it, I mean, if it tested positive,
give me more than $5,000 back refund that
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that should be standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't be able to charge for some
process that fails.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's, you know, and, and so,
so there's an aspect where like not to get
[SPEAKER_00]: lost in the TC thing, but, but one of the
aspects of these larger companies coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in is very soon the gelato and,
and, and purple wave and all this cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: and overbred shit, it's going to still
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way too popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: To like go away forever, but it's going to
become a segment of the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just a market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a huge interest in getting
back all these old things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there's, you know,
for all these clone sellers and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, I mean, that's one of the risks of
selling clones is like, like you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody's somebody that works at one of
these places is gets, it's given money and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, and all of a sudden you're just
buying it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, I don't mind if shit gets
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just mind if those people, if it gets
out there and then all of a sudden they
[SPEAKER_00]: try to claim it as theirs and restrict
others access to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in my perfect world, like just to
like throw a marker down, I think that all
[SPEAKER_00]: weed that was bred before 2018 should be
open source.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a fair statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't fucking claim shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing before 2018 that you can't
patent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ain't fucking yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's fucking, it's, it's open source
to some degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean you have access to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't restrict it legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't sue me for having it.
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ shorts, but whole is like this type
right now, but it's F'ed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it's like, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only reason I said his name is
because he has a very public claim to
[SPEAKER_03]: those using blueberry and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he does not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he used to put it on his packs that
you're not allowed to breed with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're not allowed to this with it,
that they retain control of the line or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the case may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand that too, but that's part
of selling seeds is that you're putting it
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then anyone can do anything they want
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the trade off that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been happening since the
beginning of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single famous Dutch thing,
every single famous 90 strain was,
[SPEAKER_00]: was bought seeds were bought and,
and people sold their own versions of it
[SPEAKER_00]: really fast.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been going on from the,
but what I'm scared of is all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_00]: someone telling me that like, Oh no,
we, we, we own the Chem D.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We own the 91, we own the, we own this,
we don't, you know, whatever, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, if you make something in the
legal market, if you have a legal nursery
[SPEAKER_00]: and you make your own breed and you,
and you do something like that to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it starts to get different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all the stuff that came out of the
shadows, all the stuff that came out of
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition, the whole genetic library of
everything else, it's, it should be not
[SPEAKER_00]: owned by anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, and, and that'll that,
that, that'll really democracy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a case in point, like I,
I do like having action with words and
[SPEAKER_03]: with the blue bonnet mail after I made the
lines and literally immediately after I
[SPEAKER_03]: gave it to radio ridge to, to have it open
source for any breeder who wants to inject
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry into their lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I try to stand behind that because
I think it, I really think if you're good
[SPEAKER_03]: at what you do, you shouldn't tie yourself
to one thing and you should be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: make new and unique and go to different
directions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And be inspired by stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if someone else makes something better
than you, you should be able to look at
[SPEAKER_03]: that, admire it, want to use it and better
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, Matt is not at all,
but I'm a huge, I'm a big fan of the great
[SPEAKER_00]: whole dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reasons why they have so
many shows recorded is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they played more shows than anybody
and they, and there's more live recordings
[SPEAKER_00]: of them than anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: They let tapers, they had, you know,
I mean, they made soundboards,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they let tapers set up in the
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically they said after we play it,
it's theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bootleg, don't bootleg our albums,
but our show, as soon as we're done
[SPEAKER_00]: playing it, we played it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were, that's pretty punk rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super punk rock, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, I mean, they, they came from
prankster, you know, from prankster ethics
[SPEAKER_00]: warlocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a great garage band too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, uh, yeah, I mean,
someone just said, I hear a lot of the OG
[SPEAKER_00]: lines were Bag Seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All OG is Bag Seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started with a Bag Seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: More Bag Seeds were created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, it's, it's Bag Seeds of Bag
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's accidental pollination all the
way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so that's what I think, you know,
there's gonna, and maybe that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: people can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can fight to keep, even if you're
going to crop one or two things for your
[SPEAKER_00]: little market or whatever, save one or two
other moms that you'd grow a plant or two
[SPEAKER_00]: of every now and again, and you hold onto
something that you care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it be something that you enjoy
smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always enjoy smoking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's what keeps you keeping it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what keeps you keeping it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, and then if, and then if
thousands of different people hold onto
[SPEAKER_00]: one, two or three or four things that they
love a lot, we'll have a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: heirlooms that make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it'll be a lot more insulated from
like, you know, the, the, the too few
[SPEAKER_00]: collectors like me, you know, who like
there's fires, there's issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's accidents, there's shit that can
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the more diffused it is,
the better, the better chance we have with
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff surviving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we continue, someone did ask me to
talk about and give a kind of public
[SPEAKER_03]: service announcement during these times in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's important as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of us have lost a lot of people to
suicide and unfortunately it's not just
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the whole economic society in
America.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot of empathy right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And realize that like a lot of you guys
out there that are in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industry aren't the only ones suffering.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is all, everything is all
smoke and mirrors when it comes to
[SPEAKER_03]: business.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everyone's happy a hundred percent of
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole seed community's been hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole weed community's been hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of people you can talk
to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can't find someone,
DM me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm available 24 seven and I'll get back
to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, there are suicide hotlines.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: No male should be ashamed from talking
about depression or their feelings at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please, if you can't find someone to
get help, talk to one of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's an aspect where it's like,
I live in, I would say I live in Mendocino
[SPEAKER_00]: County, you know, and I don't even want to
talk about pound prices and what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on at home right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's the way of life is all of a
sudden there's an aspect of, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: how does one survive?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a mortgage, I have kids,
I have this, I have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has worked for me for a lot of us,
you know, that are in our like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, mid thirties to mid forties or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been working for us basically our
whole adult life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, you know, and now it's changing
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do anything else good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like really, like that's not even just a
statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this is what I have done most of my
adult life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the stuff that I used to do,
that's bypassed the technology bypass a
[SPEAKER_03]: long time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of people in our
community that have stuck at this for a
[SPEAKER_03]: long time hadn't shared that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, it's scary the, the not knowing
what the future holds is scared.
[SPEAKER_03]: So talk about it with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: There used to be this thing like with PTSD
or whatever, where like getting busted was
[SPEAKER_00]: like an occupational hazard, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sucked when it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we used to be, we used to get
scared about that to some degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like, you're not scared about
getting busted as much as you are like
[SPEAKER_00]: just failing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and then that, and then that leads
some people to like look around to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, get sell out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll give you guys a story of a
back home for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, this is what used to happen
when we, when the flood hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, we used to call the flood is when
like the flood of outdoor really hit the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And prices dropped and not, not like crazy
like today, but there'd be an aspect where
[SPEAKER_00]: all of a sudden like we would be hard to
move.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, and, and the issue was,
is it wasn't like it was hard to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more like there was just enough of
it that like some of it was moving and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of it was sitting until some of the
more of it moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people would come up and talk to me
and literally like the brokers in November
[SPEAKER_00]: or December are vampiric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're like, Oh, you have,
you have fireweed and you have some
[SPEAKER_00]: savings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you have a buddy that's like three
months behind on the PG and the Christmas
[SPEAKER_00]: is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wife's terrified.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're two months behind on their
mortgage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a bunch of fireweed and they want
to make a dope deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times they didn't want to buy
from anybody that was stable for a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of months because they wanted to,
they wanted, they wanted to take advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: of the poor planners and the people in a
tight spot where they could get a more
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive deal and they could make a
bunch more margin.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was just, that's just like
standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That standard business, you know,
and a lot of times, people would,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, back in the day, especially
people would bury their stuff or not trim
[SPEAKER_00]: it till spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if you had money,
you wouldn't sell it till February,
[SPEAKER_00]: March, April, May.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's when the flood had passed a
bit and the desperation was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they started coming up and
looking for just good packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and so, you know,
there's always been sort of like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I brought that up is that
right now that's kind of what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is people are looking at seed collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are looking at clone collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are looking around it and they're
like, who's desperate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's desperate.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the cheapest I can get this out of
this floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's failing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's in trouble?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's stressed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, but you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are saying it doesn't seem like a
good way to form long-term relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, you think of brokers and
people like that want long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to win every trip to get what
they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're really doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a bunch of, the amount of
people that like want to form
[SPEAKER_00]: long-lasting, mutually beneficial,
stable relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not really weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, brokers are like, you know,
they're like, they have some stable
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with you and then they hear
that like some dude is broke and is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to sell better weed for $400 less a pound
and they're off that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's where that dude is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so, you know, and,
you know, and so there's an aspect of that
[SPEAKER_00]: where, you know, people make fun of like,
well, you know, California is all boof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an aspect of that where there
is a lot of boof in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of shitty weed and there's
even a lot of shitty weed in Mendo and
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like people are trying to like brand
legacy and brand that like the area that I
[SPEAKER_00]: come from is like all just, it's just all
been AAA and loved on.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's not true either.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was never true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true in some cases, you know,
and everyone's trying to claim it right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, but it certainly wasn't true for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were plenty content to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We eat and move it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an aspect there where like,
um, you know, but you know, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even sure where like my train of
thought was going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were talking about solutions and I
know like I kind of took it off in the not
[SPEAKER_03]: so solution oriented, just this problem
where you, but one solution and you talked
[SPEAKER_03]: about it earlier was getting a bunch of
people like minded together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now with the syndicate, what I
originally, what this was originally built
[SPEAKER_03]: for the big pie in the sky idea that I
have for the syndicate overall first was
[SPEAKER_03]: to get everyone together.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interested in weed history.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's truly interested in it wants to
learn, get together.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all make each other better.
[SPEAKER_03]: But from there, my ultimate goal is to
have it be a sort of, and I know people
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to find some people flip a union
for those who came before us.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have retirements.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of us have retirements that are weak
growers, like that are, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: traditional, um, have fallbacks for that,
have retirement plans for these people.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to form it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's going to form it for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the only way we can do that is
working together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sucks because a lot of us won't
work together.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think over time, a lot of the old
school dudes, the people that really care
[SPEAKER_03]: and people that used to butt heads even
being Fletcher used to butt heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't, we're, we're cool because we all
have that same kind of thought and goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that, that was the overall goal
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever I saw as my, I want to expound on
that, but I did gather my train of thought
[SPEAKER_00]: at like 10 seconds after you started
talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the point I was trying to make is that
like for all the people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: complaining about all this California
booth that hits their town, the only
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why that's happening is because the
broker that got it here and brought it to
[SPEAKER_00]: their things is that you don't have better
options and he can force Booth on you for
[SPEAKER_00]: a good margin for himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why there's Booth everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're angry at California Booth,
don't blame California, blame the dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dudes in your area that arranged for
that to appear in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's tons of pretty good weed in
California and there's some really
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional weed and you could force your
brokers to bring you that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then according to what, like Matt's
saying too is Matt and I battle all this
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time, but like I, what Matt just
said is basically like, we need a really
[SPEAKER_00]: big tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need, whether it's a union or whatever
else, you know, people are going to laugh
[SPEAKER_00]: at that for a second, but really what we
need is we need millions of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: get on board with the basic ideas that we
think should, cannabis should be,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then to push for those ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in some fashion, eventually we'll
probably get at least a niche of our ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning the way that we want to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if, but we're really good at fighting
at one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis used to be, it's not so much
anymore, but cannabis used to be a great
[SPEAKER_00]: place where people with some mental
illnesses that were untreated could make a
[SPEAKER_00]: decent living for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so, you know, and then you
could say, you know, and I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know in Mendo, I know like single moms
that like, you know, just like grab,
[SPEAKER_00]: grab some courage and went for it in the
hills.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were able to spend a lot of time
with their kids growing weed, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And making a living for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a bunch of people that would
have a hard time working a normal job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we interact with these people and
then they don't fucking act normal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, and then as time gets tough
for them too, they start to freak out and
[SPEAKER_00]: they start to get spastic and shit starts
getting weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, but, you know, when it comes
down to it too, like people, people with
[SPEAKER_00]: issues, like they have a right to a living
too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed was a safe space for a lot of people,
despite the risks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's changing now,
you know, it's, it's changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result of that, like,
there's a bunch of stress out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're really going to have to like,
I see a ton of fighting people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people notice, like I really,
I don't fight on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I try to be polite to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to build consensus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be way too polite or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I have to eat shit or
whatever and not take the bait and people
[SPEAKER_00]: are insulting or whatnot, you know,
but that's at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's their problem, not mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only my problem if I give a shit what
they think.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I don't, because why would I care
what you think when I don't even know who
[SPEAKER_00]: you are and I don't know what you do in
life and I don't know what your vibe is
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't know what your ethics are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one of my good friends has an issue
with me, of course I'm going to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like some stranger on the internet,
it's pissed off because I don't like
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody else or I don't like somebody's
behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, Matt, you know,
you can go to whatever, convert them
[SPEAKER_00]: however you like, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever technique it takes, whatever it
takes for you to, I'll use words,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you do, you do you in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm good at what I'm good at,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it works, you know, so,
so there's an aspect there where we want
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we want access to better weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want it to be, we don't want all
these strains and everything else to be
[SPEAKER_00]: totally controlled by people because that
will stifle innovation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hobby breeders and small rooms
are where almost all of the best new
[SPEAKER_00]: strains come from.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to come from these
fucking Chris compound phenol hunts or
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking did this person or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just, I don't think they're going
to come from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to hype shit,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we both know that like, you know,
we have friends and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those people are hype beasts
anyway, and they have way smaller breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: making their shit for them and doing the
actual stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we don't need to, I don't want
to say a bunch of names or whatever is
[SPEAKER_00]: just slipped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact remains is that there's way
better chance for one of you guys with a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking eight lighter, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To come out with the next sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then like, one of these big legal spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only way that's going to happen is
you have to grow good weed and you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep good weed in your room and you have
to keep weed you love in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best weed comes out of weed you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like people were asking earlier,
like how many, how many, how many moms I
[SPEAKER_00]: have and it varies a bunch, but it's like
my mom collection is really odd.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very, when people ask me that I'm
going to be like, why do you want to know
[SPEAKER_03]: my plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just meant in the sense that like,
you know, because like some number matters
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, but like there's an aspect
where it's, it's heavily based on what I
[SPEAKER_00]: personally like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether from a breeding perspective or
whether from a, you know, a smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective or a combination or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, there's certain things
that are kind of famous that I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really have a bunch of their, a bunch of
variations of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I don't care about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's for other people to care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already overwhelming enough just to
try to hold onto what I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard to hold onto shit you
don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it becomes tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't expect everybody to try to
like, go, go crazy and have like big
[SPEAKER_00]: collections, but a lot of diversity can be
saved by people just doing one,
[SPEAKER_00]: two, three, four, five things.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I hold anything that I'm not a fan of,
but as a backup?
[SPEAKER_00]: For a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of things, or there's
some things that are untested or there's
[SPEAKER_00]: some things that like, if I, if I have a
close enough friend and they love
[SPEAKER_00]: something a ton and they want help backing
it up, I understand that motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, doesn't don't deluge me with
like favorites that you want me to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: onto, please God, because, but,
but yeah, if you're a good enough friend
[SPEAKER_00]: of mine or whatever, there could be
something that, because that's how,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how all this stuff survives.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is, uh, it is, is, is, is friends helping
friends back things up and that insulates
[SPEAKER_00]: you from like angry exes and accidents and
fires and you know, all the stupid shit
[SPEAKER_00]: that can fucking make you lose your shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about making S ones?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't hold cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it is advanced breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're new to making process,
if you're new to identify males,
[SPEAKER_03]: identify females, if you're not familiar
with
[SPEAKER_03]: that, I recommend doing your research,
digging up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can always go to our Patreon,
join the crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we're always talking about stuff like
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have a private conversation
in a, in a few days on reversals and
[SPEAKER_03]: reversals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, people are asking a bunch of stuff
that, that, that is, um, that yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those things that you said are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we are going to be having some like
more, more concentrated talks with people,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, people are asking about super skunk,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I'm not wanting to like shout
from the rooftops, you know, or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there, I do think there's hope that,
that, uh, some of these old things exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I think they should be like grown
out and tested and, and, and sorted out on
[SPEAKER_00]: that level first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think, uh, you know, a lot of times
when people get like cuts or whatever and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're convinced that it's some 30 year
old thing and they flex it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, grow it out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not just to grow it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you grow it out and you're like,
damn, this is dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: That must be shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That must be it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's not necessarily the case just
because it's dank doesn't mean it's
[SPEAKER_03]: legitimately what you think it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're going to grow it out and
you're going to assess provenance and if
[SPEAKER_03]: it's real, make sure you know about it,
have anything knowledge about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't just assume because it's dank
that it's legit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and, and so there's,
um, someone asked, what's the closest
[SPEAKER_03]: thing to super skunk and seed?
Jeezel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeezel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pure super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeezel or, or diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeezel, diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeezel, diesel, diesels and diesels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've said a bunch of times before,
I kind of consider the diesel family to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like a modern skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not exactly a super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeezel is much closer to modern super
skunk to like an actual pure super skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it turns of like a very skunky,
like, and I don't mean like necessarily in
[SPEAKER_00]: terps, but I'm just in terms of like the
way it forms and the way it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the factors to that,
like I think sours, sours and diesels,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, have various ranges of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so there's plenty, luckily there's
a plethora it seems like of sour cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: right now about fucking, I don't know,
three dozen or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all tie back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all tie back to 1995.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really amazing that like out of
nowhere, like 36 different individual cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: that are all the real deal have popped up
in two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, yeah, you know, so I mean,
when people talk about super skunk too,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's plenty of super skunk in modern
lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Matt said, Jeezel is almost a
pure super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: What people are, what people are really
saying is that like super skunk phenos
[SPEAKER_00]: that like have rank skunk, turk like
aromas, that's the missing link,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's plenty of like, like physical
expressions of super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in the way the flower forms and
the way the leaves are and the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, various aspects of the traits of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's in a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and you know, there's a thing too,
people are asking what's weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm not, I'm, I, you know,
I'm not trying to knock anybody's stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I can say that like when I started
collecting sour diesel, to compare to my
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel cut that I had to figure out
what name I should attach to the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've held for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, probably in the, that was like,
what was that like five or six years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, there's probably like half
a dozen or eight, six or eight new names
[SPEAKER_00]: that I, that were never in the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever hear about Albany sour diesel
at the forums?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever hear about Weasel sour diesel
cut on the forums?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever hear about like the,
the, you know, I mean, so there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm not, I'm not knocking these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't hear of the cop diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just, I'm just saying that like
there's new like nicknames added to sours
[SPEAKER_00]: probably half a dozen or more just within
the last three or four years that 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, you never heard about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what does that, you know,
are they the same as other things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they the Choco or are they the Amish
or are they the, are they the this or the
[SPEAKER_00]: who knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think every time you see someone,
release a seed line that's hyped and named
[SPEAKER_03]: after a cut in the form like the sour
diesel we saw several different breeders
[SPEAKER_03]: release their versions of sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's when you see a lot of old
cuts pop up and so people's poppings and
[SPEAKER_03]: selections of brand new lines that they
think is legit enough to pass for the old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, luckily for people, most diesel
cuts are pretty damn nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smoke good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get you nice and high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Suck it growing and then it'll be boosted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I've sucked it growing diesels
before and it's been fucking boosted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diesel's can be finicky and they can be
punishing and they can not be that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's, I mean, there's, so there's,
so there's an aspect where there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe I exaggerated with 36 cuts,
but there's probably at least 15,
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 named cuts, a lot of which claim to be
close to original.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love pot asked what names are legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Names aren't necessarily legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the cuts that are legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody can call anybody cut anybody's cut
any name.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just because someone calls something
the Choco cut, does it necessarily mean
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's legit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause they called it the Choco cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like how we called,
we called it the dog and until our buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: got online and you know, and then it got
named after his online handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he was the person passing it out
and you know, who, you know, the Amish was
[SPEAKER_00]: passed out by with Shroomy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and the child and like,
so Pete things got named on the internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Choco I called the Choco because he had
some of my favorite pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were some of the best pictures
for showing people to describe which cut I
[SPEAKER_03]: had.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was called ECSD, but I said,
it's the one that Choco shares Choco cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just eventually that's how that
name formed the Choco cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and then there's,
you know, there's, you know, East coast
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel, New York sour diesel,
you know, all these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was like a first wave in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just called sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't really told the forums and like
the mid two thousands that names started
[SPEAKER_00]: getting applied to sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a batch of names and
now there's a new batch of names.
[SPEAKER_00]: What really, what really is happening is
that most people have not held their sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel cut consistently throughout the
eras.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're trying to figure out what name
is the one that ties back to what you
[SPEAKER_00]: want, but it's really hard when you lose
chain of command, when you lose chain of
[SPEAKER_00]: who has what when.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt and I talk about provenance or
whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the provenance of my sour cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it 22 years ago and I never lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I know what it is before I got it?
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do I know how, what,
where it went and how it went between,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the mid nineties and when I got
it in 2000?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually if you don't lose things,
like, you know, that if you hold onto
[SPEAKER_00]: things for a long time, then it sort of
becomes like, that's part of the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: why I never tried any of these other
sours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't I get a different one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know there were, I didn't even
know there was a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would I go trade someone for it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, and people are like,
what's this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the difference between the two NYCD
and ECSD cuts?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he probably referring to NYCD from
SoMa.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think people know about the other
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was talking about the Millie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if mine's the Millie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude that has the Millie,
he got, he got his the same year I got
[SPEAKER_00]: mine and the same place I got mine,
which was the Bay area of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've never exchanged cuts or grown
them side by side to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some people would use that as enough
info to say, yes, in fact, that is the
[SPEAKER_03]: same cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and, you know, and so,
you know, he calls it the Millie because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's short for Millennium because he got
it at the turn of the Millennium.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, but with diesels,
I don't really think it's a, it's a fair
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison unless you grow them in the
same room at the same time, same
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, same outdoor, treat it the
same, feed it the same, and then you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see differences if there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's the same cut, it'll be the
same cut.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't, I can't compare somebody's
LED living soil grow and at different
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions to somebody else's and they
just come out too different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my, you know, and sometimes with
the same person, they come out different
[SPEAKER_00]: crop to crop.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York City diesel isn't Dutch boof.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is weird and shitty in the sense that
Soma took the diesel name and was one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the first people to offer seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was some Euro fruity thing crossed
to possibly a sour bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to believe him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nine hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, people have found some nice
beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing like sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good ones aren't like sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, someone's asking about master
Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: My boy bitters got a killer version of,
uh, master Kush, which is the SoCal master
[SPEAKER_03]: Kush crossed to the hog's breath.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's just running through those.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an old seed line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, I'm stoked to see it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're stoked to see some SoCal master back
in the form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to, I can't really,
I'm not going to engage a ton on like what
[SPEAKER_00]: all the different names are because one of
the things that I found with sour names is
[SPEAKER_00]: like, they get applied to a variety of
different cuts at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's, it's really difficult,
uh, to try to figure out, uh, sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I don't, I don't know how,
I don't know how, like, I don't know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to go back on that one or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even the headband and a lot of these
things that I've held for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's still more mystery than I would
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just willing to say that there's
mystery to it rather than like craft some
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Story of certainty when that exists.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stories sound so much better when they're
full of intrigue and mystery, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I mean, I've had people tell me,
like people, someone just said the Albany
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts totally legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know someone that's had it since 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have told me, people have told me,
some of my weed is spread out a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: and some people have been trying it and
liking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have told me that they think
that the cut that I have is the Albany for
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever that's worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I, I haven't gotten it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any, no confirmation of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I think a lot of people are
throwing a lot of different names at the
[SPEAKER_00]: wall and trying to figure out,
which is cool because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least there's a bunch of interest in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour Diesel is way better weed than a lot
of the weed that's being traded right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the hype boy weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should have a moment in the sun.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, somebody said there's a master,
there's, the only thing I'll say about
[SPEAKER_00]: Master Kush is that it seems like there
was a, there's a SoCal Master Kush that
[SPEAKER_00]: seems cushy, but it's kind of a Bubba-ish
hybrid in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a, there was a Master
Kush that we had up North that was much
[SPEAKER_00]: leggier, darker, thinner type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't all that frosty,
but it might have like my favorite Matt
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a lot of Master Kush grown on the
forums from Nirvana.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the majority of Master Kush I'd
seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a lot of like big short squat
baseball bat, not just fat, fucking short
[SPEAKER_03]: squat Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a lot of that in the mid to
late 2000s from Nirvana being grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a, someone just said, that's the
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had that cut for probably 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost it when I got in some troubles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it back, but it was super dutted and
barely drank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's, so we lost it again,
but I hope I have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a chance it still floats around
Oregon somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some friends that gave it out and
I'm hoping that like, it'll pop up one
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people didn't like it as much as far
as brokers because it was a little darker
[SPEAKER_00]: and wasn't as, as poppy in the bag as
certain other OGs, but man, it had a great
[SPEAKER_00]: high and it tasted good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people seem to have the SoCal
master that some, that's, that's also
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's very, very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to diss it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not the one that I wasn't
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems very Bubba based.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very Bubba based.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, it is a dead ringer for Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's Bubba with some,
I don't think it has coffee turps like
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can, depending on how you grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of soapy, a lot of earthy,
but it can hit coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just depends on how old it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Irene OG cut is around various
collectors and people have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irene two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, the, the Bubba, the original
Bubba is lost as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What survives is the Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was, which is a, which we believe is
a hybrid of the original Bubba and the
[SPEAKER_00]: first Kush cut that came to LA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A seed found in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the original, no one,
no one's told me that the original Bubba
[SPEAKER_00]: even exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a, it was, it was a funny looking
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a shame, you know, because,
you know, like I said, preservation is
[SPEAKER_00]: hard and a lot of people get rid of a lot
of things thinking it's going to be easier
[SPEAKER_00]: to get it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they realize they can't find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone's asking it's if HL, the Hopslate
and Viroid is something that's always been
[SPEAKER_03]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the answer to that, I will,
we'll cover that on, on September 8th
[SPEAKER_03]: with, to me, to me is the company that
we're going to be bringing on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the short answer is no.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know exactly when it came and hit
cannabis and who did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just asked if I met the guy that
gave me the Mendo perps, would I,
[SPEAKER_00]: would I grow them like I did back then
enthusiastically and would you trust him?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then I grew water culture,
total hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very unlikely that I would grow
them back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like, like now I have a little bit
different methods now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sure, I would grow them just as
enthusiastically.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doubt that there's a lot more
lying going on about ancient strains now
[SPEAKER_00]: than there ever was in 1998.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1998, nobody gave a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't a fam unity to impress on any
level, you know, and so there was less
[SPEAKER_00]: lying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even then, he didn't tell me very much
at all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason why I have a tendency to
believe that it could be as old as he
[SPEAKER_00]: thinks it is, or he thought it was,
is because it's low THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a crazy wide amount of diversity
in its genes, you know, and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: seem like it's related to anything else we
know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so sometimes the plant backs up
the story better than the, but there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: unbelievable amount of bullshit right now
with ancient seeds and ancient cuts and
[SPEAKER_00]: random shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, there's a renewed interest in
old things, which is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's led to an enormous amount of
scamming.
[SPEAKER_03]: An enormous amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: An enormous amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just don't think that in 98,
99, 2000, 2001, there was no extra money
[SPEAKER_00]: and nobody cared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think there was nearly as a
reason to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just bothers me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too, because I'm not going to say any
names, but people are selling people in,
[SPEAKER_03]: in maybe it's a big word, but dreams.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like things that you haven't had that
you can't quite verify, but you want,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're willing to spend good money on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when they sell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how they sell.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yes, because we're talking about
swapping genetics and trusting people,
[SPEAKER_00]: trusting people these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: These days is hard, you know, um,
you know, and, and there's not,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's not as easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of times, you know,
you have to grow things out and then share
[SPEAKER_00]: that share picks and share this and that,
and try to make your best judgments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buddy CSI grows out old seeds from
people all the time and just kind of lets
[SPEAKER_00]: it, lets it, lets the plants show him what
it shows them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then he starts to believe or
disbelieve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, someone's asking about Tennessee stud.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a, it was the G 13 and all two from
Neville crossed to blue bonnet and pips.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did the selection for the keeper that
we used in the G 13 and all two seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to say names eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've said names for so many years and
frankly, it hasn't made much of a
[SPEAKER_03]: difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if you, if you're interested in names,
if you're interested in wanting to get it
[SPEAKER_03]: right, if you're interested in all this
stuff, the discourse, that's just where it
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you, if you're really interested
in that kind, that detailed kind of info,
[SPEAKER_03]: join the Patreon discord, you'll get
plenty of info and then some, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the reason why, um, part of the
reason why we have that kind of approach
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're hesitant to mention some of the
names on the chats is because like we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be talking about some wider subject and
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I or somebody will make a offhand comment
about someone specific and then 10 people
[SPEAKER_00]: will send like a 15 second audio message
of just that to that person and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all but heard or they're whatever
it's taken out of context or they're
[SPEAKER_03]: doxing me or whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and, and so there's an aspect of,
there's an aspect of, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: of wanting to keep it a little bit more
like high brow and wanting to keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on the subject and not just,
uh, and, and, you know, not using somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: as an example and then they feel unfairly
singled out in certain rare cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think it's like crazy enough
behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, we'll just say it,
but the point of these talks is to like
[SPEAKER_00]: educate people and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much to just sit there and like
vent a bunch of grievances.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's easy to do to sit there and
vent a bunch of grievances.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really easy to sit there and talk
about things that will make you money,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's not super easy to talk about
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody just, somebody just asked if G
13 and NL two is still available and no,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I gave the rest of those seeds to a
seed bank and they passed them out and
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't put, they mixed up packages,
named them ABCD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they just got spread throughout.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know which is which.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some people have them and may not even
know it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it is labeled by a letter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and usually what happens is when
people grow those out and I can see them,
[SPEAKER_03]: I can usually tell what it is because they
were all so different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there's an aspect too of one
of the, one of the reasons why,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, um, one of the reasons why I ask
people to save stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, and hold onto these things is
because every five or 10 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis really does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things that you think are common and
they are going to be around for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time and many cases they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way you can be absolutely
sure to preserve it, if you or your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends, um, you know, uh, if you or your
friends help make sure you, you stave it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and, um, real quick,
uh, I was talking with CSI.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people have been asking if we
were going to continue the Northern Lights
[SPEAKER_03]: Project, um, with the NL one, NL two,
the NL two by five that was sent by
[SPEAKER_03]: Seattle Greg.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a few others.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had been debating it because there was
a lot of, um, politics when we were
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about selling the seeds,
when we were selling the seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of backs, back talk and weird stuff
going on behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really had a serious sit and think,
is it even working?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it worth it?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go ahead and do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the announcement right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody is interested, we are going to
do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, just like the five,
just like the Hawaiian lights,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to do it proper.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take our time with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, anything that's worthwhile is going to
take time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should say on that level that one of
the things I really like about the way CSI
[SPEAKER_00]: does and, and, you know, this project that
him and Matt have been doing is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they grow out a few hundred
plants and they show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I'll, I, I, I'll do them a
little bit later this fall, but I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple selections, uh, from CSI that he
out of, out of his and Matt's project
[SPEAKER_00]: together that he gave me of a couple of
his favorites that he wants me to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the number eight is the one that he's
currently working on reversing,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is the super, super stinky skunky
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think there was a, there was a,
I think I got that that one and I got one
[SPEAKER_00]: other one that I think he thought was very
bubblegummy and the seven.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I got, I got two different ones
that he really liked a bunch and wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: some close friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: He must like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave you the two best ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeez.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, so you have to do to get
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I, uh, I do dumb shit,
like hold onto things for friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't even know if I'll like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to see, you know, but they're
there and, uh, you know, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: people are asking, I don't know when I'm
going to have seeds, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, it's when I have them at
some point, you know, there are some,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are some, I did give, uh,
CSI a few things of mine, a few,
[SPEAKER_00]: a few select cuts that he's obviously like
released a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he has a few more things in the
pipeline who I know about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not so, not so LA Cush cross that just
happened too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I, you know, I haven't talked to homie
in a couple of weeks, so I'm behind him
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have been meaning to, I don't know
if you want to, but he, I think what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening too is that like he's kind of a
pain in the ass to get excited about
[SPEAKER_00]: certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can be like, Oh, you want to do
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd be like, Oh yeah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden he'll be like,
Oh, I want to do that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll, and then it'll start
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has moods.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I think the Northern lights took a
while to get pushed like that because he
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't like stuff typically associated
with Dutch stuff, stuff that's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: smell like old Dutch stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's got his prejudices,
but he also lets the plants talk to him
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's willing to be surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think now that he's used the LA in a
couple of things and he's gotten some
[SPEAKER_00]: really positive responses from lots of
people, it's made him more interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing what else it can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, I don't think,
uh, Shanti Baba would be one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: unusual people to collab with.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not much of a collaborist with anyone
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't know if he's ever done a
collab with an, anyone in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be pretty far fetched.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be pretty far fetched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, so, uh, yeah, but they,
um, I mean, so, you know, as always,
[SPEAKER_00]: we try to keep it like light and we try to
go in different directions, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, on that aspect, but, um, you know,
we'll see, there's a lot of, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of interest in old seeds
right now and old lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a bunch of people could get 90
centsy work or 90 serious work,
[SPEAKER_00]: or this or that, they would jump all over
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, um, you know,
uh, hopefully some of that stuff survived
[SPEAKER_00]: and hopefully amongst the wave of
bullshit, uh, there's actually a few real
[SPEAKER_00]: gems that come to the surface as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think a lot of people really,
really miss the fuck out when,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, Pips Weed offered Silver Pearl,
like people who are into old, dank,
[SPEAKER_03]: unique, legit shit when Pips Weed
released, at least that Silver Pearl,
[SPEAKER_03]: we talked about it a lot because it was
one of my favorite, it still is one of my
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite things to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are times when people do drop
these old gems that they've kept forever
[SPEAKER_03]: and people just for one reason or another
miss out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So make sure you guys are keeping your
eyes peeled to these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think Pip was just like two
years too early.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if he was, if he dropped it last
year, like in 2021 or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he had some, because the crazy thing
about Pip's Silver Pearl, um, is that like
[SPEAKER_00]: you look at that, you look at a picture of
that weed and you hold it up to old Silver
[SPEAKER_00]: Pearl pictures and boy, is it a ringer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a dead ass ringer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it really, really looks like,
you know, if not this, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it's the same plant,
but you can really see like it's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: close resemblance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his Death Coast, like for people,
if you would release Death Coast now or if
[SPEAKER_03]: that clone made it around, it would smoke
every, I, in my opinion, it would smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: most sours, it would smoke most burnt
rubber stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was some of the loudest weed
I'd ever, ever entertained.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's, he's got, you know,
the cool thing about him is he breeds what
[SPEAKER_00]: he loves and he's got some pretty cool
lines and he also got a bit lucky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, a couple of times,
I mean, he's gotten unlucky too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he tried to, he tried to reverse
his sour cut and I think he got like 20
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, and uh, you know,
Silver Pearl, to me, this is kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: unusual smell, but like Silver Pearl to me
smells like baby poo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like, it smells like,
it smells like little kid poo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just living on milk when
they're very young.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you don't know that smell,
but I've had a bunch of kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it smells like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has this weird, it has one of those
smells that like smells gross,
[SPEAKER_00]: but cause it's weed, it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like to me, I smell like a hint of
bubblegummy, squeed, and the rest is like
[SPEAKER_03]: dang indescribable thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like my nose smells just indescribable day
with like sweet, pleasant bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's pretty leafy and it's,
and it's pretty, it's pretty frosty and it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't yield that very big buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's insanely resinous for its era.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's insanely resinous for its era.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, um, it's, uh, what is the
exact cross again?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's like, is it early girl by
NL five by skunk one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Early Pearl NL five skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they cross, he crossed that to
haze sea and made silver haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, especially that death coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some things that PIP did and he
wasn't like a fan boy on IG and he didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have this massive following, but if people
would have like bought him out,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the way they bought some more
well-known breeders out, they probably
[SPEAKER_00]: would have been happier.
[SPEAKER_03]: All that money you spent on other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you enjoy your animal mints.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, did it remind you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it remind you of the smell of
shoreline?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, it didn't to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, shoreline, like I said, the indoor was
very hot garbage.
[SPEAKER_03]: The outdoor was very hot garbage and,
and legit urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just asked what's early Pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding of early Pearl is early
Pearl is, uh, a worked early girl,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, um, something that, which is
Pollyanna cross with, uh, early Pearl,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe is Pollyanna, which is a Mexican
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross with early girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's worked stuff from Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the Pollyanna came from Rob Clark,
the early, the early girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Pollyanna came from Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the speculation that the Afghani
and I think it's the Afghanian or the
[SPEAKER_03]: Mexican and Pollyanna might be the Mexican
at Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one thing we are trying to
figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, there's some,
I mean, I'm sure that, uh, Sam and him
[SPEAKER_00]: know, um, and, you know, but yeah,
he, he was responsible for a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: early strains that went over to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe he brought over Cali,
uh, uh, Cali-O maybe California orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, you know, but there was a,
there was a handful of, there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: handful of people, um, that were bringing
things to Holland and he was certainly one
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but yeah, and there's no doubt
that, um, Rob and Sam, Sam in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in that we're working with Mexicans and
Colombians trying to get Colombians to
[SPEAKER_00]: finish in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were working with various,
and that makes sense because that's like
[SPEAKER_00]: the two most important things in that area
at the time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone's asking about Dolores.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to go grab a picture of
Dolores.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't have it close.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the other room.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the other room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a guy, there's actually a guy
in here that I chat with Buckshot Hill
[SPEAKER_00]: whose, whose family, uh, was rocking a
really nice early pearl cut in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the early nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and has been hunting, uh, through any
kind of seed he can to try to see if he
[SPEAKER_00]: can find something that he remembers from
that era.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a nice early, early pearl cut in
San Diego too, in the hog room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so yeah, you know, some of that,
some of that early work, some of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, is, is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I wish it was still around for,
I mean, there was an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to this gentleman,
this gentleman from Australia,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who worked with Neville, um, some of the
last years of Neville's life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, one of Neville's great
regrets is that he couldn't take all the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff he had in the eighties and nineties
and work it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: With like, you know, 30 more years
experience and a better sense of things
[SPEAKER_00]: and a better sense of the importance of
things in certain aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did a really good job back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a lot of breeders have that
regret where it's like, boy, do I wish I
[SPEAKER_00]: had everything I had in the nineties and
early two thousands now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, I have a lot more knowledge
now, smoked a lot more weed, seen a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more things, talked a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, um, and, uh, and yeah,
so, uh, that's, that's early girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I wish that we could get
stuff from Sensei that was real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, um, I think those times passed
sometime by the early mid two thousands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: People asked, how did they go downhill so
fast?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened to Sensei is that,
um, they, I think they were legit all
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the nineties, even after
Neville left, they still had most of their
[SPEAKER_00]: original moms and dads, and they released
some things that were like unreleased
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville work in the later nineties anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the laws changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they lost some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then they outsourced to Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the big death now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, I actually believe that
there could be one or two things amongst,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the, their collection that might
still exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the ones that did get
everywhere in state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, but which ones are they and
which ones are legit and which ones from,
[SPEAKER_00]: who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think they've been untrustworthy
for at least 15, 15 plus years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but they had a good 10 year run,
you know, from the early nineties to the
[SPEAKER_00]: early two thousands, they had a lot of
legitimate stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would, I would be very suspect of
anything from Sensei today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the shame is that Ben Matt and I have
talked a bunch about having Ben and Alan
[SPEAKER_00]: on, um, because they were there and they
know an enormous amount about the early
[SPEAKER_00]: history of Dutch cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but they are, uh, very Dutch
businessmen and we've been told that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're terrible interviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they still claim to this day,
they have all the original parents and
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensei is no different now than it was in
the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, that's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They promote Sensei.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're not really interested in
history or being accurate or telling you
[SPEAKER_00]: what they lost or what they have or what
they like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, keep our seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done a whole episode or two on
Canadian seed banks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll probably do some more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it just involves getting more of the
Canadian people involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause me and not to have no place telling
the history of Canada seed banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we're not, yeah, we do have,
we have a, we have a good friend we chat
[SPEAKER_00]: with all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from up there that has a lot of
connections and a lot of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, Matt talked to,
uh, to, um, a couple of, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red and Chimera, you know, um,
there's some other friends of theirs that
[SPEAKER_00]: might come on at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, yeah, it's not really our
scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, um, Shawnee's going to be
probably, uh, interview.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had an interview with a dude named Pete
from up there that was also part of their
[SPEAKER_03]: scene, but sadly we don't have the audio
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone else has it and we can't get it
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're probably going to do another
interview again and just try to get it
[SPEAKER_03]: from scratch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shawnee's going to help a lot with that
cause Shawnee's our Canadian connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone just asked, what about the dudes
that are revamping the SSSC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well we had a big interview with
Carell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so the guy that used to own the
company is still alive and still a part of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe, you know, he's in his
seventies now probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, I would imagine his son and some
other people are doing a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and it doesn't seem,
it's, it certainly doesn't seem like they
[SPEAKER_00]: have a ton of their original stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're trying to revamp things,
but it does seem like they have a few,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least one, but possibly a few very old
cuttings that they're using sort of as the
[SPEAKER_00]: baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to get restarted again from
their work in the eighties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that was a great interview too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember after that was done,
we were just so stood like, cause it was
[SPEAKER_03]: special.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like nobody had really done a great
interview with SSSC in many years,
[SPEAKER_03]: many, many years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you haven't heard that stuff,
go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I liked a bunch too,
was that obviously they talked about how
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't have any, um, he was very
upfront about quite there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was very upfront about most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a few things where, you know,
time or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't want to speak to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, but he did give some really
cool tidbits that we didn't know before
[SPEAKER_00]: and he added depth and he was certainly
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so all that stuff is very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that interview probably had the
most bombshells in it that we've done of
[SPEAKER_03]: things we didn't know that were unknown to
most of the public.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's, so he's part, he's part of the,
of the revamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're certainly not going to be able to
like just release their old catalog like
[SPEAKER_00]: it was in the eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but they do have some old things and
they're mixing them with other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know when I interviewed him,
he seemed like an older version of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: He seemed like a cool cat, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm into him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a nice man.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you want to cover tonight?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, we are, we are, we are
getting right there, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what else I wanted to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if there's, if there was
anything, um, we can save, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can save, you know, uh, some of that,
you know, for a later date or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have some notes written down and
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, you know, like, as always,
there's a bunch of stuff that the
[SPEAKER_00]: questions and things that I see,
I try to pick out some out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we didn't answer them, it's not because
it wasn't a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just didn't go with the flow of what we
were chatting about, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't, um, so you can always ask us on
the discord or you can always DM,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uh, or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, you know, keeper topics,
keeper topics are hard because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: personal preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what I, what, what I consider a
keeper, you might not consider a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we might have different criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the big, the biggest criteria that I
would say for a keeper for you is do you
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy the flavor, the high and the way it
burns?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are like, you know, do you like,
if you personally like it a whole bunch,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, then it could be a keeper.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if, if, if I don't like the
flavor of something, even if I like the
[SPEAKER_03]: high, it's not very likely that I'll keep
smoking it for myself, but some people may
[SPEAKER_03]: prefer the high over the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's very, I mean,
obviously it's, it's the easier to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: her becomes easier when, when she checks
all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, I mean, grandpa used to say
there's nothing wrong with rich and
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but, um, you know, so obviously if you
have phenomenal high and incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor, uh, that's great, but you know,
there's plants I keep that don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: very potent high, but have other aspects
that I like quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there's, there's the reverse too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've talked a bunch about that,
that, uh, um, that peacemaker that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the, uh, the great white shark
cut that I had that was almost
[SPEAKER_00]: hallucinatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so strong, but it tasted like
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't find a good one that had any
flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, all right.
