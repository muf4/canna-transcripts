[SPEAKER_02]: I love you too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skitch bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Swerve of Lisa?
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone said, where's the Swerve of Lisa?
What?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Bryn's uh, lovely creation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was all her.
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you say?
[SPEAKER_04]: Swerve of Lisa?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Swerve of Lisa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Swerve de Milo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so wait a little bit for people to
start coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you already in here,
so I've got a big box next to me of some
[SPEAKER_02]: oldies and goodies and um, there's a lot
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just the stuff that's packed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but we've got some cool little treats
like this for the auction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, so you guys know at the
beginning, we're going to do the auction
[SPEAKER_02]: at the end of the show, near the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not sure how long this one's going
to take.
[SPEAKER_02]: This might be a um, this might be a two,
two hour long one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends on how long they want to take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how annoying is that that everybody
who messaged me, it makes a loud ass
[SPEAKER_02]: noise.
[SPEAKER_02]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: How goes it?
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're perfect, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I decided like, you know,
I mean, we talk all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been trying to figure out the whole
super skunk fiasco.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: From, from point of where, um,
I guess, uh, what, what, how do we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: label certain people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, we can just call a skunk va,
skunk va.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since, uh, everybody knows, uh,
everybody's familiar with that moniker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem dog is chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another familiar moniker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunk Va and my old buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think during the podcast,
he called him his buddy from Staten
[SPEAKER_01]: Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's a private dude and kind of out of
the scene at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just going to like not say his
name out of, uh, respect and that he's,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's, uh, he's long, uh, you know,
his part is important, but long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of respect for him, we won't,
we'll just refer to him in code.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strangely, he's one of those rare people
in the industry that is not seeking past
[SPEAKER_01]: fame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not P bud guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he is actually the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start with, where, where do you
want to start the superstar story at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where should we start it at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we'll start at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my buddy from Staten Island,
uh, him and Skunk Va were very good
[SPEAKER_01]: friends and they used to travel and tour
together or dead tour days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the early nineties, a dude wanted
to move out to the West coast in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was more into seeing, uh,
Jerry Garcia shows than he was into seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: the actual dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Jerry would play at the Warfield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically every month, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a big ass hippie gathering at the
Warfield, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my buddy, uh, kind of stopped
touring, uh, moved to Sonoma County,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and, uh, started seeing every Jerry
show there.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously Jerry shows are, uh,
uh, you know, they're like honey to
[SPEAKER_01]: deadheads.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so a whole bunch of
deadheads would always attend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the shows at the Warfield,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Skunk Va being, being from Virginia,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of his old crew and mentors and
various things like that were East coast,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one time some of these guys came out
and from the East coast and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: they, uh, were partying with all those
guys at the Warfield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so Skunk Va and I's mutual friend used
to have this strain called the Francine.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us about Francine.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little offset, but tell us about
Francine a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Francine is a mystery indica that,
uh, we didn't use the term at the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was about as terpy as terpy gets.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, eventually dude dropped it because
like a lot of Afghans, um, it had a
[SPEAKER_01]: horrific mold problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and as you know, you know,
when you, uh, when you grow things,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, that horrifically look beautiful and
horrifically mold at times, it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: depressing harvest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happened to you a few times with a cut
and you can get PTSD and decide to drop
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you know, like, uh, get people get
emotional about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does she smell like?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it, it was a really good
combination of like that, like that Afghan
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of acrid funk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with, with like a fruity aspect,
but not like the tropical sativa kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just had like a really deep,
like, like foot funk fruit kind of flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: to it, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, so these dudes loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, um, they loved it so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were willing to trade this skunk that
they had for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So separately to all this story,
and, uh, skunk vase kind of talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: this extensively on his, on his podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just briefly touch on it,
but chem dog, chem dog wouldn't give out
[SPEAKER_01]: the dog, which is what we call it to
anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He held it for tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't want anybody in his circle
getting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't want to get cut off,
you know, um, or have other people sell
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when homie moved to California,
he agreed, look, I'll give it to you if
[SPEAKER_01]: you just don't ever share it with anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back East.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't want to compete markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't share it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically what happened is that Skunk
Va arranged with his buddies to trade the
[SPEAKER_01]: Francine for the skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude decided to make a double trip where
he would bring the Francine out to
[SPEAKER_01]: Virginia and he would trade it for the
skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he would drive up to
Massachusetts and he would get the chem
[SPEAKER_01]: dog that was promised to him.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that's committed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is committed.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1993, a homie drove across a bunch of
shady ass States with living plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, not very many and small,
but still, you know, still fancy if he got
[SPEAKER_01]: pulled over, he probably would have to eat
them, you know, or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have the state checkpoints.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to do all kinds of, you know,
this was actually pre pre, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: to use a term we joke about most of the
highway 80 drug checkpoints and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was in 93.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they really hadn't gotten wise to that
too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh good.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you took the middle route, uh,
you, you were pretty much safe for the
[SPEAKER_01]: most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could still get pulled over,
you know, and he definitely looked like a
[SPEAKER_01]: hippie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he wasn't secret sauce or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't look like a young Republican or
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so he drives out to Virginia and,
uh, and meets, um, what we just learned
[SPEAKER_01]: actually recently ended up being dude's
actual worker because the dude had already
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of gone on the run for a bit and was
weaving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he gets this, this super skunk cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to interject as far as we know,
the person we're referring to,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, not by name, the Staten Island guy,
um, that as far as we know, this is scum
[SPEAKER_02]: fee is mentor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is how close we can put skunk VA
to the beginning of this cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as we know, the guy that agreed to
do it is the mentor, but apparently the
[SPEAKER_01]: guy that actually did the trade is one of
his workers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I asked when all this confusion
came up a few years ago, I re I asked
[SPEAKER_01]: Staten Island, um, do you remember the
exchange well enough to be absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: sure?
[SPEAKER_01]: What did he call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you fast forward to like when I became
friends with these guys in the late
[SPEAKER_01]: nineties, it was always called super
skunk, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Staten Island, uh, he gets,
you know, he told me that straight up dude
[SPEAKER_01]: said, this is a super skunk cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he gets it straight forward.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he trades, he gets it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he drives to Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he meets up with chem dog and he gets
the 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we all call it the dog, but you know,
everybody on the internet calls it skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: fog cut or 91 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, but everybody back then,
it was just the dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of these dudes were organic
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he was chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't want to put him on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy, they weren't super into calling
it chem dog because they grew fully
[SPEAKER_01]: organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so we destroyed dog and amongst
all of us long before it got famous or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that, that's just kind of
the shorthand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've been writing that on labels
now for two decades, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so he got an extra cut or two of this
super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he gave one to chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's so chem dog got it basically by
accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got it by proxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like by accident, by proxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got it because homie decided to go to
Virginia before Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a, what a wild question.
[SPEAKER_01]: He could have reversed it and gone
Massachusetts, Virginia home.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he went Virginia, Massachusetts home.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That act, that choice, in my opinion,
I mean, we've talked about this a bunch or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever that ended up leading to a whole
series of accidental events that became
[SPEAKER_01]: super important, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, so then he drives back home,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he's got super skunk and the dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you went to Warfield shows in San
Francisco to see Jerry band, you probably
[SPEAKER_01]: could have seen him slinging all that in
front of the show every single month.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, um, so skunk thought took a different
tact and he could speak to this for
[SPEAKER_01]: himself, but he kept touring basically,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when Jerry died in August, uh,
this next week here, we call this the days
[SPEAKER_01]: between because Jerry's birthday is on the
1st of August and his, his death is on
[SPEAKER_01]: the, is in a week now or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these are like Easter for hippies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of like the, yeah, it's the,
it's the Easter week or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you know, skunk Va decided to
settle down after Jerry passes,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when he started growing,
you know, cause obviously to grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to be semi stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's not really dramatic lifestyle,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so those pictures that he's been
posting of Polaroids and everything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that are after our buddy gave him the cut
from his friends in Virginia and he
[SPEAKER_01]: started growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's basically how, that's
basically how this, this cut from Virginia
[SPEAKER_01]: made its way to Sonoma County,
the Bay and Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And see, and then this is a great intro
to, to the chem dog story as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: which we will cover in our podcast,
which will eventually be here soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so that's the start of, that's the
start of the super skunk movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I, uh, I met, uh,
I didn't know them then personally,
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of years after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, my, you know, my,
uh, my buddy, uh, he fell in love with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendo P couple other things or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he ended up giving me the super
skunk and the dog for safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Safekeeping, you know, and, uh,
and that's in the late nineties and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of how I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've had it, uh, well like not the
super skunk, but the chem 91 and it has
[SPEAKER_02]: stayed with you ever since.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had that since I never lost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, unfortunately the super skunk was
lost, uh, but we'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so we have this stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, this is obviously,
um, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so late nineties, 2000,
2001, this whole little era right then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got like the internet is in its
like infancy essentially, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Overgrow had just began in 98.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there really wasn't any internet fame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these things that have become super
famous and like Holy grails and all these
[SPEAKER_01]: people trying to figure out stuff.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, most of the stories that I believe
that I've heard about this stuff comes
[SPEAKER_01]: from that era.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that was when there was nobody
gave a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the sense there was no reason to bull
about any of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no fame associated with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no rep.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no, I mean, it was literally
like, there was like four people in
[SPEAKER_01]: California who had it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was me Skunkva our buddy and,
uh, uh, I see collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, who was really close friends with
Skunkva, you know, uh, and, and Greg and
[SPEAKER_01]: that, and he, and he ended up like,
uh, moving in with Skunkva and that's how
[SPEAKER_01]: he got the cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was literally like four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so not very big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not back then you had enormous
rooms or anything like that, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really wasn't very much of it even
being produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're blowing it up with the four lighter
essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're blowing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly, mostly eight, six lighters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you guys are swinging hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Twelve lighters or whatever, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, you know, and so,
uh, so just to keep it back on the super
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk tip, um, you know, uh, obviously
it's been quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but here, here's what I know for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was, uh, I never ever heard it
called anything but super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, obviously we've had some
debate amongst friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole different thing we can get
into later about whatever, about some
[SPEAKER_01]: different, different names and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it may not be the exact same
thing through different crews or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as, as far as my little group
goes, um, that's what it was always called
[SPEAKER_01]: straight super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so buddy from Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would love, like when we'd have tremors
over, you could pull side branches of that
[SPEAKER_01]: thing and you could hold it up to the,
the picture in the catalog of the 90 seed
[SPEAKER_01]: bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like a dead ringer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would, you could find buds on the
plants that like match that look exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very, very uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: I witnessed him dozens of times over
multiple crops, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just cause he was just so cool
because it's like exactly like the picture
[SPEAKER_01]: in the catalog, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he could show you, Hey, this really is
super stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're buying, you know, and so,
uh, you know, in a lot of ways,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it was a sketchy plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that was, you know, that was the very
beginning of the two 15 era, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it wasn't really, you know,
two 15 had like multiple eras,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The first five or six to 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the cops, the courts, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was still pretty much underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still getting fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: People hadn't grown to like, let's have a
greenhouse outside my back door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brilling, uh, indoor was still sketchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was still not the jam, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so the super skunk, you know,
the last two or three weeks, it literally
[SPEAKER_01]: people joke about carbon filter killer,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the only strain I've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, um, absolutely defeated every
opportunity I ever had to win.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know any other way to
describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of burn it would give me,
like I would pull up with two weeks to go
[SPEAKER_01]: in front of my house in summer and it
would smell like a dead skunk in my
[SPEAKER_01]: driveway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the feeling, not with scones,
but every direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, back then you're just
like, Oh my God, you know, that is nerve
[SPEAKER_01]: wracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was a thing at which I had,
obviously people know on this,
[SPEAKER_01]: on this thing, what scrubbers are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a CO2 scrubber with a fan scrubbing
the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had, uh, or a carbon filter,
sorry, not CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a carbon filter, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so that's scrubbing the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had a carbon filter on the
exhaust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had one of those huge UV on air
double, uh, you know, uh, ozone
[SPEAKER_01]: generators.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even did the recommended 25 or 30 feet of
tubing before it went out the building to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure it had time to mix.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it still smelled like I was
slaughtering skunks in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's kind of how it was,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, it was trippy in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you know, it, it was, it was,
I dunno, it looked dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when it looked dense, it was still
wade light.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was those things where like you,
you know, you put a nug on there and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, oh, this is going to be
impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, oh, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hollow.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they make hollow weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like solid, but it was fluffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like almost like ice cream or
something that had a bunch of air whipped
[SPEAKER_01]: into it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, um, you know, and the turp,
the weird thing about the turp is that it
[SPEAKER_01]: was super volatile in my opinion,
like really stinkin' until the last bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it would stunk for about a month
or five weeks after you cut it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, if you let super skunk go too
long in your jar or whatever, it would
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually kind of smelling semi to
generic greenberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could crack a jar in the other room and
someone would walk in and ask me what was
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you would have to like crunch the
shit out of it and deeply smell to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a whiff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But fresh, it reeked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and you know, it was kind of
hard to trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it could be sparse, you know,
when it didn't, uh, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: for most people, um, the probably the
easiest way to think about it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, real old school sour has a
lot of similarities to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so when sour doesn't want to
come out the right way, it's a bitch to
[SPEAKER_01]: trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like people lose heart,
people start, you know, your, your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your crew gets disheartened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, I got to trim diesel,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I posted some stuff for you the other
night, uh, that I sent you where like my
[SPEAKER_01]: old sour diesel cutting, it looks like
those tops, those colas, they really see
[SPEAKER_01]: those same super skunk tops that skunk va
posts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can really see the similarity in it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so the other thing that, that,
uh, so it had unbelievable turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when people talk about RKS turps
or whatever else, it was the terpiest,
[SPEAKER_01]: skunkiest, rankest thing imaginable,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it really was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, you know, it also,
you know, uh, it also harmed like a
[SPEAKER_01]: motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, that's like really the first
thing I ever heard about mass super when I
[SPEAKER_02]: first started getting into the scene and
learning the history and stuff that that
[SPEAKER_02]: shit was a harm bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a harm bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, we would pull it about eight
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you would, um, you know,
you would try to take it longer because
[SPEAKER_01]: you think maybe it needed to be done more
and then would harm for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is, and this is kind of
weird about it, is that it harmed early
[SPEAKER_01]: too, because well, as a breeder,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you pull, if you, let's say you pull
the super skunk at 58 days and you find
[SPEAKER_01]: tiger striped beans in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When were those beans made?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, they're early on,
probably primordial.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to be early on because it takes a
good four to six weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, to mature it.
[SPEAKER_01]: To like fully mature and get that dark
tiger striping that looks all healthy and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so you pull a strain at 58 days just
by the law of how beans grow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had to pot, you know, if something had bad
had to happen in three weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that act, that in my opinion,
you know, and there's a certain amount of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we can get to opinions about it,
but that factor created a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: weed that we like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's the crazy part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Craziest part about all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through live harms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, in the, in the the,
you know, the, the buddy from Staten
[SPEAKER_01]: Island, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He was not very into sharing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, when I got, when I got the
dog, I had to promise that I wouldn't give
[SPEAKER_01]: it out, you know, which I didn't for
forever, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would have like, we would have like
really good friends of ours that would beg
[SPEAKER_01]: me for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be like, you know who you have to
talk to, get him to call me and say that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have it and I'll take cuts for you
tomorrow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But otherwise, like I'm not breaking my
word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like we're all good friends and he's
going to know you have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that makes me look like an
asshole, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, you know, issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, this is the,
you know, this is what I had to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he wasn't as strict about the skunk,
but he kind of felt the same way,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, me, like I try to be as
like, as etiquette as possible with cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even like to pressure people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they have their own vibe and their
own energy about why they come to you or
[SPEAKER_01]: not, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, so what sucks about that
is that we didn't spread it very far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we weren't on forums or anything like
that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Staten Island buddy is not weasel,
clock glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, he's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not paying very much attention to the,
the words at the bottom of the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as anything, maybe Mac can say it or
repeat it again or something, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's totally not, it's totally not him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so the fact, there are two
things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is obviously back then, most people are
growing for profit, you know, on some
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having a cut that reeks the high
heaven and scares your neighbors and herms
[SPEAKER_01]: on you, you know, it made it dicey on
people holding it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we never, you know,
Skunkva, myself, you know, our buddy,
[SPEAKER_01]: we never really spread it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't trading.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't active on the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we weren't swapping cuts out
right and left and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, that's a, you know,
that's a different discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you know, like every time,
my opinion is, is like every single time a
[SPEAKER_01]: famous named cut happened, like purple
craze with Urkel and GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sour or the cushions, whatever,
a whole bunch of amazing diversity just
[SPEAKER_01]: goes to shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people want to fill their room or
their greenhouse or their whatever with
[SPEAKER_01]: something that some guy is going to come
and snap it from them, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want the, the shit that's going to
sell up for the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even amongst most of my close friends,
I've always had a bitch of a time getting
[SPEAKER_01]: people to back things up for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People want one or two plants that they're
currently doing for production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't hold on to a bunch of stuff
that they're doing for safekeeping or
[SPEAKER_01]: heads or whatever, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't that easy for me to get it to
be backed up anywhere, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, when it comes to,
you know, production and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: some broker finding seeds is fucking doom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, Hey, do you want to grow this
thing that could potentially lightly or
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily seed your room?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not, not really now, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean, so we all grew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sorry, sorry, I just had to boot
someone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to, but he was being a
jackass and being real rude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wasn't even paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's kind of the start of the,
of the Cali super skunk, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stayed with our little crew and,
you know, and, you know, the Massachusetts
[SPEAKER_01]: side of things and Greg and all that other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: One second, Masonic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm being real fucking serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're being fucking disrespectful as
fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to fuck you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you keep it up, knock it the fuck off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have some respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been real fucking cool to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, what happened with chem
dog in Massachusetts, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: who, when, how he shared what with,
you know, all that type of stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as far as the, as far as the
actual super skunk cut goes, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's one of those things where like,
you know, nobody wanted it until it became
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of this legendary famous thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everybody started poking around
trying to figure out who might've kept it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Staten Island and I, we had this thing
where like two of our favorite strains
[SPEAKER_01]: were obviously the super skunk and the
chem dog, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the super skunk had the lime green and
the frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, from the chem dog,
you know, from dog, dog isn't particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not super frosty compared to other
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's darker cut, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: It cannibalizes its own leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't even always taste good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it can taste amazing and I love
the flavor, but like I could grow it all
[SPEAKER_01]: year long and only two crops out of five
be happy with its flavor at times,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And why exactly, why, why exactly that is,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had this idea and this was long
before, you know, I mean, there was no
[SPEAKER_01]: real American seed companies or anything
like that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were, we were doing a bunch of
breeding, but we were doing a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding that was literally for our taste
buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was not for public consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: At best it was going to be grown by us and
spread out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we created this, we created this
thing over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Staten Island started it and I came on and
helped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we did some work on it
together that we eventually called the
[SPEAKER_01]: super dog, which is in the Canna Bible,
the second one, I think.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my first, that was my first
experience with kind of really finding a
[SPEAKER_02]: strain that I wanted to hunt right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I got along quite well with
Jason who wrote it and I gave him a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of accurate information, a lot of that got
twisted and turned into some of his
[SPEAKER_01]: entries about the dog and the chem dog and
the super and all that type of stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So be that as it may, what we were trying
to do was we were trying to combine the
[SPEAKER_01]: terps and the look of super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the potency and some of the density
and some of the niceness of the dog.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it was like a, you know,
and so, you know, and strangely,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is another thing of why I think
maybe it disappeared as we talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: this recently too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to believe that the skunk and the
herm is related.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can't say for certain, but I think
it might be a linked trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of evidence for that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and as you know, you know,
there's, there's very few traits that
[SPEAKER_01]: people breeding have, you know,
more prejudice against than banana,
[SPEAKER_01]: banana sacks with herminum, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think inadvertently people bred
away from the skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without realizing it because, you know,
you breed some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hermy mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, Oh God, that's a hermy mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get, you know, I'm not going
to breed towards that side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea that you could have a linked
trait where you have a very desirable
[SPEAKER_01]: trait and a not so desirable trait
together, you know, the biggest breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: pain in the ass ever is a link trait with
undesirable traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, Oh, all the potency comes in
these low yielding ones that suck,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all these huge donkey dicks and
like have the structure is incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all bland, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, the problem is,
is that, you know, you have a situation,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, it's kind of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, like I told you about with
the Trinity, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the Trinity didn't spread very far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we lost it and I kept trying
to get it back, people would give me
[SPEAKER_01]: fakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not because they were dicks most of
the time, but because they never had it
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they got it from someone,
they didn't, they had no way of knowing
[SPEAKER_01]: that it was an it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then I would have to be the bearer
of bad news, you know, and be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, this isn't it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people hate the bearer of bad news.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what's happened with
the super skunk, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that there's obviously this desire in
the community to have these, these
[SPEAKER_01]: roadkill turps come back, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone who finds super skunk has a
current seed company and is making seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: to sold to the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one ever shows up to events with a
couple jars of fresh skunk and lets the
[SPEAKER_01]: proof be in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get the cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: They advertise the cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're breeding with the cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find the amazing turps in the cut,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they get kinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so you don't know, you don't know
if they're lying because I don't know or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, or they just have no,
they just never had it in the past,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to know that, to know what skunk
is, what actual, to what the actual skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: cut is, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, by the early to mid
2000s, it had been dropped enough that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, various people had lost it
through, you know, lots of the same
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons that everybody loses cuts,
fires, busts, accidents, rickups,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, people not returning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had it backed up with a couple people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They refused to give it back to me at one
point and then lost it in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had some stuff happen and I lost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been, you know, we've been
hunting it ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I mean, we're both
obviously friends with Skunk Fa.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these new school super skunk finds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what are you going to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: They just end up, they end up not looking,
I mean, what's awesome is that he's got
[SPEAKER_01]: these, he's got these, you know,
these pictures, these Polaroids that are
[SPEAKER_01]: undisputable proof that that was the cut I
had.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is so big that he has those pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're buddies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it from, you know, it came from the
same place.
[SPEAKER_01]: The story was the same thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's, it's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you have all these other
shorter, squatter, afghan, all these other
[SPEAKER_01]: different looking, you know, super skunk
cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other part of it,
too, is that you have people that like,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, so this guy had the super skunk at
once, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then as soon as that dude verifies,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then all of a sudden, okay,
we have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we can trade bait it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we can get spread out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this person has the cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the problem, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I mean, before everybody
who's listening, holy shit, we're up to
[SPEAKER_01]: 242 people on this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the super skunk was not a perfect cut,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it wasn't, in my opinion,
it wasn't the holy grail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it have crazy rare skunk turps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had that spades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it enjoyable to smoke?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it held a candle to the dog,
the D, some of the cushions, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: modern cuts right now that we would
consider to be elite, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: You would consider it to have moderate
potency at best.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't, you know, I mean, you know,
various cuts have various qualities and
[SPEAKER_01]: other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and so it didn't check all
the boxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it a great cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it worth having?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it a pain in the ass to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: At times, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about, but, you know, I mean,
I think you know, I mean, obviously,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all of ChemDog's early breedings
were all accidental.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as far as we know, that's the
correct, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was, well, I mean, the thing is
that nobody was reversing back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus fucking Christ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yeah, Noah's making femseeds back
then on purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Femseeds back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you only, you know, so,
you know, the only way you're crossing two
[SPEAKER_01]: female cuts is accidentally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And those accidents, you know,
they led to some of the best weed ever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In many people's opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I mean, that's like a whole
other thing that steps, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe it steps on toes or doesn't to talk
about all those kinds of theories about
[SPEAKER_01]: various things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have not seen the real super skunk
since I lost it, which has been,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been hunting it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I I don't think it exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always the possibility there are
still pockets in America where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, people aren't really connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not dialed in to like the scene,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously, just like we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to jump on a European trip,
everybody thought the A52 was lost for
[SPEAKER_01]: well over a decade.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody could find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Karma found a guy that was
holding on to this cut for Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville told him not to tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the A52.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Karma wasn't even sure what he had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to give it to Yosemite,
who he grew with Neville forever,
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow it out and confirm it was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's possible, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is absolutely possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we are all desperately hoping that
happens, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, yeah, it's possible that that could
exist because the A5 was lost for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a short period of time that it was
lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think it's I think it got lost
in the Switzerland raids when they shut
[SPEAKER_01]: down Shanti and those different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it got lost in Holland during the bust
eras.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was lost for, you know,
10, 12, 14 years, something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: until it just popped up within the last
few.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last few.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now losing friends fast over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's fucking arguing over it real
fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, it's cool that people are
still fighting over over cannabis made in
[SPEAKER_01]: the late 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To how good it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's also not only as a
testament to how good it is, but like,
[SPEAKER_01]: people want to make money off it,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got rare and you've got rare
access and you can bring some things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're a breeder who operates in
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got something nobody else
does and you can hype it and it's worthy
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can, you know, I mean,
that's what all these super scum people
[SPEAKER_01]: are trying to do, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to make a bunch of money
before people realize they don't have what
[SPEAKER_01]: they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the jam.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people want to sell
seeds or pass cuts or do this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got a good minimum four months,
three months before you're going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: any kind of pushback.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the other problem is that I've
noticed when people either invest in
[SPEAKER_02]: buying that cut or they've invested
emotionally in that cut at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they think they've got a really rare
cut that's going to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: bring some kind of value to their life,
however they see fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're now in that mindset where this
is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not it, I don't have whatever
agenda purpose that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was saying with the Trinity,
people would get butthurt at me sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: when I would be like politely,
it's not it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would go full thing and you don't
know what I traded to get it and da da da
[SPEAKER_01]: da da da.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be like, well, you know,
I'm sorry about all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have nothing to do with any of
that, but yeah, remains to be seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still not it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just isn't it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it's gotten to a point
where there's a narrow group of people who
[SPEAKER_01]: had super skunk it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them had longer relationships
with it than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some of them are a little bit
better at identifying than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without naming names or stepping on toes
or doing anything like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've had issues in the past in the
community with people that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: are, you know, well thought of or
respected that verify.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once it's verified, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's all that's all she wrote.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's verified.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then, you know, I,
you know, hit up, you know, skunk bar or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be like, what about that verified
cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It absolutely isn't it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they ever had it,
if they think that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, like if he tells me if
he hits me up and he tells me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I found it, I'm going to get
excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he's I I tend to think him above
everyone else is going to know that cut
[SPEAKER_02]: really, really intimately, being that it
came from his mentor and he worked with it
[SPEAKER_02]: for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, the fact the fact
remains is that him, our buddy and myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: we cropped it quite a bit for three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do crop after crop after crop for that
a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You run anything for a number of years as
your as your main squeeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you learn a lot about it.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: When my buddy and I were I mean,
that's the thing, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we've talked about this
before is that since we bred with it a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch, I got to see, you know,
that's one of the things that I really
[SPEAKER_01]: respect about, you know, say like CSI or
archive who I see on here, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: where there's only so many breeders out
there right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually test their own gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your own gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really know what you don't
really know what traits your clones pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're never going to see it
firsthand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see what how they breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they breed clean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they breed a mess?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they throw consistent phenotypes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they, you know, growing a bunch of
growing a bunch of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truth band.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone's asking about truth band.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's that's a whole subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but yeah, you know, but so we grew,
you know, buddy from Staten Island and
[SPEAKER_01]: myself, we grew out hundreds of,
you know, dog and and skunk and other
[SPEAKER_01]: various skunk hybrids, you know,
and and we saw what it passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you see what it throws out,
you know, and so a lot of the the various
[SPEAKER_01]: like semi proven, semi unproven theories I
have about certain things we've talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about a bunch are on my observation of
like not very many people like had both
[SPEAKER_01]: parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, gunk va, my buddy, myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like literally in like a handful of
people that probably had both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and we're familiar with both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I mean, you know,
the the skunk definitely seemed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: connected to herms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The you know, when we were doing the the
superdog stuff, if we bred away from the
[SPEAKER_01]: herms, we bred away from some of the stuff
we liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the trick was to try to find like
a minimal or acceptable amount of herms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, like, say, take the Chem D,
for instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem D herms like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: At times, if it gets a little,
especially in depth.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not as much as indoor,
but in depth, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if it gets a little stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not live pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It throws bananas, but there's not really
live pollen in those bananas, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you're looking for you're looking
for, you know, one throws herms and has
[SPEAKER_01]: the stink, but doesn't have the danger
inherent in in all that, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a long and expensive breeding
project because back then, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously, herb went for a lot more and it
was a lot riskier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any time you dedicated rooms or areas
to constant breeding, that could have been
[SPEAKER_01]: just some kind of production run and then
you're not even selling the beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just for you and your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but but, you know, we had we
always had dual stuff like we always had
[SPEAKER_01]: this goal of trying to, like, you know,
improve the gene pool a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, create more weed that we liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now it's like most most people's
breeding is like take two famous things
[SPEAKER_01]: that people want, mash them together and
then sell the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it's like we were like, OK,
like we like the skunk smell and we like
[SPEAKER_01]: the color and we like the, you know,
the quickness and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we marry that to the dog's potency and
feeling and warmth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Warm happy buzz and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there some hybrid that we can create
that marries those two things together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's obviously the classic way to
breed is you look at two different things
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're like, I want traits from this
and traits from this to end up in its
[SPEAKER_01]: progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so that's that's really the
gig.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it, you know, sadly,
it seems like a bunch of the stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: got passed, it got passed around in
Massachusetts quite a bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems like from what we've been
able to determine that it's maybe it the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual cut itself wasn't passed around
nearly as much as people think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one, maybe bag seed, maybe something
different got passed out and it got called
[SPEAKER_01]: super skunk and it was from said dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, of course, it's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're off to the races and then
that thing gets spread around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the more, you know, I mean,
we've we talked about this before,
[SPEAKER_01]: too, but like, you know, Rez calling his
fucking line sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they fucked everything up.
[SPEAKER_01]: A named cut and then makes a fucking line
out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding the actual named cut once there's
a whole bunch of of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, other stuff out there that has the
same name is problematic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it became damn near impossible in some
cases with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and, you know, and so I mean,
you know, the I think the super skunk has
[SPEAKER_01]: a semi there's obviously there's some
pretty famous people in the weed community
[SPEAKER_01]: that had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that ends like some gravitas to the
fact that it was killer and then they was
[SPEAKER_01]: killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it comes from this 90s historical
era, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and then on top of that,
it probably is in a bunch of other things
[SPEAKER_01]: that people don't realize it's in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody knows what a rank skunk
smells like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody in America, for the most part,
is probably in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once, you know, and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a really distinctive turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't or file.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, some people on here know
some people don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got lucky enough and I cracked the
men what became known as the Mendo P. You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, and what's interesting about that
cut is that, like, if that cut didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: exist, there's no other line that I know
of that has those turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like those turps are in cannabis,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're obviously in cannabis,
but it's very unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: The modern cannabis and anything you find
that ends up smelling like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you discover it was descended from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, you know, the the skunk
knows in my opinion, really only pops out
[SPEAKER_01]: here and there in its descendants on
occasion.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendo purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and so it just doesn't even
it nobody's found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's nobody's made the turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's found the turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's been able to produce seed lines
or cuttings any time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if they did, it would be
announced.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would be it's they would be at
conventions or, you know, Emerald Cup or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever with jars and they would be,
you know, it's a lost turp that people
[SPEAKER_01]: want back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone who can capture that that diol turp
into a seed line that reliably produces it
[SPEAKER_02]: and and let it stay in the bud form is is
going to master it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so it's obviously a lot of constituents
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But man, trying to get something that
really hangs with that smell past flower
[SPEAKER_02]: is very, very hard to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, and so everybody it's got
universal recognition of what it should
[SPEAKER_01]: smell like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole bunch of fake cuts that
people try to pretend smell like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really did smell like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so with it, there's no
faking the funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you have skunk oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can rub it on a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, and all and all that and all
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's like the scientific method,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if somebody can't grow it and produce
the same smell, it's not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like you had to do a bomber job
of growing it, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, you know, obviously in
the 90s, we've all gotten quite a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: better at gardening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Older, you get more experienced,
you learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's way cooler products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That make your life easier, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, we used to mix soil in a
fucking cement mixer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: From raw amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these biological amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't all these like, you know,
inoculants and booze and teas and this and
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there is now it was like it was like
GH and, you know, Earth juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, the even just the stuff that
you could get and like you were and you
[SPEAKER_01]: were just happy that the store carried.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty limited compared to now,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that turp just it just existed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone's saying about the Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not from the Pacific Northwest,
no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turpenberg, think about that question for
a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Mendo perp from the PNW?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, it's too it's cool,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any whoever asked that any question is,
you know, he's Turpenberg's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really down to it like most.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that just so, you know, like,
you know, Matt and I are going to do a
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to we're going to do a podcast
pretty soon here and chat about history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really what it boils down to for me is
like without the I don't really give a
[SPEAKER_01]: shit about fame or rep or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of our history in the cannabis
community is oral, you know, passed down
[SPEAKER_01]: from people to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are people that have heard the
real deal and have verified and cross
[SPEAKER_01]: verified type stuff, you know,
but it can be really hard for people to
[SPEAKER_01]: come along later or don't have personal
connection to something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, bullshit spreads like wildfire at
times, you know, and certain people have
[SPEAKER_01]: vested interests in in spreading bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, counteracting that with
truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an underground illegal venture and
lots of little individual groups,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like passing on knowledge to
each other, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just so happens that, you know,
like the Grateful Dead and the kids that
[SPEAKER_01]: follow the Grateful Dead, that was
probably like the greatest open air weed
[SPEAKER_01]: market in American history at a certain
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after Jerry died, started growing
weed because it kept the lifestyle going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a while now, it's not it's not
true anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're just a segment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for a minute, you know, in the 90s and
mid 2000s, like almost all the best and
[SPEAKER_01]: most famous cuts came from some hippie or
another some crew, you know, some related
[SPEAKER_01]: group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're only so far removed from all
those people because it's a small world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it, you know, most of this
stuff, I just got lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the sense that, you know, I mean,
you have no idea what's going to be famous
[SPEAKER_01]: or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that we're doing like, you know,
the dog didn't get famous until Skunkva
[SPEAKER_01]: decided to get on forums and start
chatting about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knew who, you know, except around
the East.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knew who Chem Dog was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knew who Peabod was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knew any of these people's names or
what they were involved with or anything
[SPEAKER_01]: else, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so it's like, you know,
all this stuff kind of happens after the
[SPEAKER_02]: fact, you know, when you're just like,
you're just kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're closing down on this first episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how much time you have and I
don't want to take any busy, busy guy with
[SPEAKER_02]: all your family.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want, we could start,
reinitiate it and continue again for a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually, my family is grocery
shopping right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay, perfect time.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm going to end it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll restart the live feed and then we'll
continue on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like what we're seeing with Jeezel
and stuff like that.
Word.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you in a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.
Thank you.
