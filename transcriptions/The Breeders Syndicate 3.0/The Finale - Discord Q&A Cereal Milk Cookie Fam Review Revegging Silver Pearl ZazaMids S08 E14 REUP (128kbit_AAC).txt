[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_02]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_02]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_02]: seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_02]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_02]: all the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The syndicate is a collection of seed
makers that want to push back against all
[SPEAKER_02]: the smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_02]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the season finale of season
eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, me and thousand thousand will be
joining us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be going through users
questions and kind of have a relaxed
[SPEAKER_03]: kickback episode to end the season for a
real kind of serious breeding topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, let's kick it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is one we got from Buckshot
Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, a while ago, but we couldn't get
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see how we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so Buckshot wants to know,
he says, I've been talking with not so
[SPEAKER_00]: about the early Pearl and how best to
proceed with my goals for finding a long
[SPEAKER_00]: lost, you know, or doing a 2.0 remake with
starting material that's period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: The topic has been brought up to the
syndicate before and it's been discussed
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe speculated that one might be the
unknown indica never used to make early
[SPEAKER_00]: Pearl improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been planning across with silver
pearl to bring the DNA of 90s early pull
[SPEAKER_00]: back into the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so agreed that is a good direction for
a starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also been looking into what pure
indica would have been available to
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville in 8990.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Big Bud fits the possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started Perfect Pearl Seeds from Pip and
Lost Pearl from Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both are silver pearl S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, does this sound appropriate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so this is an interesting one
because this is a mix mixture of
[SPEAKER_00]: provenance and what we know of these lines
as well as a breeding question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Early Pearl is an early, early line
brought to the community by Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure who like the basis for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say we're brought to me by Rob
Clark.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure who's actually responsible
for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Later on, early Pearl worked its way to
Holland and into Neville Schoenmaker's
[SPEAKER_03]: hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: According to his one of his last partners,
early Pearl ended up being one of his
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite strains ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was constantly working to trying to
find the sweetness that was in the Mexican
[SPEAKER_03]: in early Pearl because he felt like the
sweetness that was coming through in the
[SPEAKER_03]: early Pearl was from the Mexican or
Oaxacan type side.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's that's the idea that he
was going for behind early Pearl was the
[SPEAKER_03]: sweetness in that Mexican.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he liked the high a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the high from the Pearls quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're going to do an early Pearl
project, like, I think that's a great
[SPEAKER_03]: place to start.
[SPEAKER_03]: And mostly because I love silver Pearl so
much like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, though, I don't remember how
much different like the S1s like from
[SPEAKER_03]: Greenhouse are going to be from like,
say, at one early Pearl clone that went
[SPEAKER_03]: around San Diego.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, early, you know, like there's a
bunch of different ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know how similar they all were
to each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know how similar silver Pearl
was like the early Pearl clone I saw.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want a basis for provenance
like that, that perfect Pearl from Pippus
[SPEAKER_03]: Killer, some of the best silver Pearl work
that there is with silver Pearl,
[SPEAKER_03]: though, there's definitely some stunk one
in it in the in the smells.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's it's a world of other sense,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's one of the few skunk one lines
that really doesn't get too muddled down
[SPEAKER_03]: with skunk one silver Pearl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I those lines would be perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know anything about, like I said,
anything about the Greenhouse line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not very consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they kind of I mean, they're for their
bait and switching in the first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, never know what you're going
to get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with this line, I've seen it run it,
used it read with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's an amazing thing to
start with.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the unknown Indica, I think the
big definitely a viable option.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot of reading that Neville
did where he didn't disclose what he was
[SPEAKER_03]: using.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I tend to have the sneaking suspicion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like from knowing Neville
and talking to him and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: messing with them that I think,
you know, usually when I see things like
[SPEAKER_03]: unknown Indica being referenced by
Neville, it immediately makes me think I
[SPEAKER_03]: was probably using Afghani one or
something for Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he hated Sam the skunk man so much
that, like, if there was any use to name
[SPEAKER_03]: his work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's anyone you would strip credit
from, it would totally be Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so, yeah, all you ever did was
don't talk Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I swear to God, he used it in a lot of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and named it other things, called it
other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so that's just a theory.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know some of the other partners share
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Theory with me, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because Buckshot mentioned that his
guess was Big Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I imagine that if it had been that
there's no reason for it to not have been
[SPEAKER_00]: named.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the other side of this,
I mean, I had a thought here, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: also because he doesn't mention it,
whether Buckshot himself has a sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pearl that he wants to capture or
whether this is kind of like an abstract,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like academic thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he doesn't have that experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think his family had a early,
early pearl cut or seed line that they
[SPEAKER_03]: cherished.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why they're going back to hunt
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think they have a lot of experience
with the pearls.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'll be tremendous help.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, obviously, like if you have a
ton of experience with early pearl and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're running through a bunch of silver
pearl crosses, that's going to be tons of
[SPEAKER_03]: help, you know, to select away from the
skunk one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Buckshot, I guess you got to keep us
updated on how this goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Buck and his wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I hope you're doing well,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is a bit of a broader
question, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one has more to do with the
industry and maybe ethics and philosophy a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is from Squirrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asks, what's the difference between
a breeder, a seed maker and a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company?
[SPEAKER_00]: He also wants to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also wants to ask you about ghost
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's more to the question that
concerns Josie and Subcool, but maybe I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know, do you want to like include
that now and just address his first
[SPEAKER_00]: question?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do the first one first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so this is something like I spent a
lot of my career trying to not necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: educate people on, but try to help define
this for the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and make it very clear that there are
different categories so that when people
[SPEAKER_03]: are shopping, they understand who they're
buying from, what they're buying and all
[SPEAKER_03]: of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the difference between a
breeder, a seed maker.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the last one?
[SPEAKER_00]: They say seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess maybe that could mean like a
potentially like a seed bank, maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so yeah, let's do breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do breeder seed company seed bank
seed seed seed maker seed company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So breeder, let's start with a breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is rarely going to be anyone who can
actually call themselves a breeder in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, even though our show is called
The Breeder Syndicate, like realistically
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at agricultural breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't call myself like a real breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't sit there and work a line for 25
years, bring it to market, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like hunt sports in a line, like all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, that's very much breeding breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: In cannabis, though, we kind of
considering what we've had, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and who's led the way and how they've done
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Breeding has been a lot different from our
cultural perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so much different than ag.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the breeders in our community tend to
be what we consider the people who have
[SPEAKER_03]: worked many lines, multiple generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they start with a goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look at their tools in their toolbox,
be it clones or seed lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they say, what can help me get to this
goal?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they, you know, they use those
tools and work until they meet that goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be several generations in or it
could be one generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's that's breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Breeding is just goal oriented selection
to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there's seed making and anybody can
make seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that's not that's not a secret.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like anybody can make seeds and anybody
can make seeds that turn out decent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody can make seeds that turn out
insanely fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: But seed making isn't necessarily breeding
while you are making seeds while breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: A seed maker is one in our community.
[SPEAKER_03]: The definition would be one who makes
seeds, but they're not really into the
[SPEAKER_03]: selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not really working lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing, you know, one off crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's and it's a very valid way
of selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like most of the market is this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say ninety nine point nine percent of
the market is this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do a lot of this one off crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to take it further,
feel free.
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, you know, drop it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the most common thing you're
going to run to in the seed world is seed
[SPEAKER_03]: makers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can have seed makers that do
breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that I've done that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've done more seed making projects
than breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's the majority of our
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have something like a seed
bank and a seed bank is somewhere where
[SPEAKER_03]: you can go and get.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea would be that you can go and get
a multitude of different options of lines
[SPEAKER_03]: from a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually a seed bank hosts many breeders in
cannabis in our culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it's usually gone down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then there are some breeders like CSI
that are so prolific that you can
[SPEAKER_03]: literally get almost any cross from them
and they become a seed bank in themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so prolific.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a rare, rare occurrence.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's people who claim that they
do that, but there's not really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be the overall rundown on that
off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the main differences is goal oriented
versus just strictly production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I know I didn't go into ghost
breeding yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that that's like a natural next
step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess this is when the seed making
itself or breeding, I guess, is outsourced
[SPEAKER_00]: to someone else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of us have done this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see no problem with doing this for
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to be transparent about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of people that hire me don't
want me to be transparent about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's fine, too, because it's their
prerogative.
[SPEAKER_03]: How they how they move their seeds and
sell their seeds isn't up to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to clarify, Matt, you mean that
you've you've done some ghost seed making
[SPEAKER_00]: slash breeding for other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For other seed companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And made seeds for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sold it under their name,
you know, and let them rep that as their
[SPEAKER_03]: strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't really go around telling
people that you made it because you got
[SPEAKER_03]: paid up front.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's your goal is to just do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And their goal is to be the seed maker.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it was a lot more common to see back
in the day, like things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know what's going on today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the ghost breeding, quote unquote
ghost breeding, is done in Spain or in
[SPEAKER_03]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people are buying their seeds bulk
from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I well, I spilled this out in other
episodes, but essentially like in the in
[SPEAKER_03]: the mid 2000s, the way it worked was,
you know, like Amsterdam would source out.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were already making seeds in Spain
and they were making crosses of things
[SPEAKER_03]: like random northern lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that the plant just said NL in
the in the buddha seeds room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange bud, white widow AK 47,
white Russian.
[SPEAKER_03]: White rhino.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hash plant like there's a lot of things
like that, just normal, generic things
[SPEAKER_03]: that you would have seen in like senses
catalog back in the day is what they say
[SPEAKER_03]: they have in Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they make crosses of all of these
feminized crosses of all of them,
[SPEAKER_03]: every single which direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the Dutch companies given a
catalog and they'll look through it and
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll say, oh, this is the closest to
what my Cali mist was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or this is the closest to what the white
rhino has.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or this isn't even close to gelato,
but fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's put it in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: People won't know the difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Barney's farm, you know,
like their punch or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can name any of their their work work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's essentially how it worked
back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would go through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would try to find something that was
similar, genetically similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would be good enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, 2005 on anybody that bought
anything from Amsterdam, from any Dutch
[SPEAKER_03]: company, that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all outsource.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a wrap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spain is making everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is now confused because
everything's being relabeled and renamed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so think of all the breeders
post 2005 that were using Dutch genetics
[SPEAKER_03]: to make their hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Matt, like from the point of view of
these companies or seed banks,
[SPEAKER_00]: outsourcing the stuff or, you know,
kind of picking from these catalogs,
[SPEAKER_00]: the incentive for them are quite clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously going to be cheaper and
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm curious, and this is a tangent,
for you, when you were doing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: what was the incentive for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like, why would you have gotten into
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does one get into that?
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I got into it is because I had
small spaces and the places that wanted me
[SPEAKER_03]: to do these reversals had massive spaces.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though they were choosing what I
got to work with, like I got to see
[SPEAKER_03]: massive populations done in these big
reversals that I was doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my main motive was that, just getting
to see populations grown and traits and
[SPEAKER_03]: all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't matter what it was as long as I
was getting to see massive populations
[SPEAKER_03]: because that was my goal, is to see
massive populations and what comes of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were some interesting benefits
for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes it would be friends,
you know, like friends who had seed
[SPEAKER_03]: companies that were down at the time and
couldn't make the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd just be like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put it out there and do it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they knew that I'd do it and do it
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if any of you are still hiring,
you know, I do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how many seed companies are
still in existence after this fallout.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, that was a big thing for
a long time, making FEM seeds for other
[SPEAKER_03]: dudes so they could sell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, in a way,
when one first hears about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might seem immediately like it's a
scummy thing, but not necessarily,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be super innocuous.
[SPEAKER_03]: In that situation, when I do it,
I'm using the real clones to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're getting the product that you
think you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like they outsourced it and
you're getting Calumist White Rhino when
[SPEAKER_03]: you think you're getting wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're actually getting what you're
supposed to be getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only transparency that's not there
usually is who made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of these guys that I did this for
don't even really communicate with the
[SPEAKER_03]: public to say that they made it or didn't
make it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just assumed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's inferred because they're such big
companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't really interact, you know,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an important distinction to make
as well, that even within this endeavor of
[SPEAKER_00]: ghost breeding or outsourcing seed making,
that there's still a difference as there
[SPEAKER_00]: is with actual breeding between the people
who are using the real materials and know
[SPEAKER_00]: what they are doing versus the people who
don't.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's one of the things I definitely
want to put out there, too, is that
[SPEAKER_03]: Spaniards got shit on a lot because they
were the ones making the seeds that the
[SPEAKER_03]: Dutch were selling.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Spaniards did really good work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they were very competent.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guys who were making the bulk seeds
over there were very competent.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were some of the first pioneers doing
massive, massive FEM reversals over in
[SPEAKER_03]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a lot of respect for those
dudes, a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just unfortunate how it played
out because, like, in Spain, it was just a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of dudes with, like, no ego at all
that wanted to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just wanted to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they didn't care about a name.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't care about getting famous at
all.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the onus was, I guess, more on the
people using these seeds and selling these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds on and how they represented them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if there's no transparency,
it makes it kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You think that there's a guy named Barney
at Barney's farm doing all this killer
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barney and Burner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Barney and Burner.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is no Barney.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder who Barney is.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't even exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a guy named Gary somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, actually, those were a couple of
good insights that you kind of have talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about these things before, but maybe not
in that much depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were cool anecdotes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ghost breeding, it's a tricky thing
because, like I said, yeah, it's
[SPEAKER_03]: political.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the weird thing was that I've got
accused of buying bulk seeds from Spain
[SPEAKER_03]: and selling them.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a company to have to do that,
you have to be a pretty wealthy company
[SPEAKER_03]: moving a lot of seeds to make that viable
method.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're buying them bulk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're spending like 20 grand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have 20 grand to be buying bulk
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even financially and economically,
it would never make sense for me to
[SPEAKER_03]: outsource something not that big.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no reason to outsource.
[SPEAKER_03]: The kilowatt hours in Spain versus the US
and the land prices in rent was why a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of people chose, why Spain ended up being
the place to do all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The permissiveness, because it wasn't
super permitted, but it wasn't super
[SPEAKER_03]: attacked by the police.
[SPEAKER_03]: Local police there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the kilowatt hour and the space is
why.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also why Columbia opened up,
too, and why Columbia is starting to
[SPEAKER_03]: produce a massive amount of these seeds
down there for the breeders up here,
[SPEAKER_03]: the seed makers like the compounds or
whatever of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mentioned to you that just before we
started recording that I watched the
[SPEAKER_00]: burner video from visiting Thailand to
open the cookie store there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also wonder next what Thailand is
going to, what kind of platform or
[SPEAKER_00]: possibilities Thailand is going to
introduce.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to say something very,
very, it might hurt a lot of people's
[SPEAKER_03]: feelings.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be a little spicy, but I saw the
worst of California go to the worst,
[SPEAKER_03]: go and be the worst in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they went to Michigan,
the same people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they went to Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they're all in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just been this downward slide of
failure and refuse all going to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's good dudes there, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: The good dudes went, but a lot of bad
dudes went.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of bad dudes that just ripped people
off along the way in all these states all
[SPEAKER_03]: ended up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm very interested to see how that
plays out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They went there because they think it's
fucking lawless and they get away with
[SPEAKER_03]: some crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they know what they're in
for either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe either later in the year or even
2024, we can try and wrangle a Thailand
[SPEAKER_00]: update from someone who's over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a buddy there right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you could definitely do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been interesting to watch his
journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's rough, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: When he first got over there, I'm talking
about HBK.
[SPEAKER_03]: We interviewed him right before he moved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just watching his journey on Facebook,
even adapting to the food and water was
[SPEAKER_03]: brutal to watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just got so fucked up by that place.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many things that I wouldn't
even think about when thinking about
[SPEAKER_03]: moving to Thailand to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just basic food survival stuff that our
American stomachs can't take.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think this could be an interesting
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, man, I can discuss this later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, coming back to Squirrel's question,
was there anything else you wanted to say
[SPEAKER_00]: on ghost breeding, Matt, before we moved
on to the second part?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just that it's more prolific than most
people know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to not name names because people
really think these people make their
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds, but the biggest sellers,
the people who make the most money in
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds, the compounds, the seed junkies,
name a few names.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't make their seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have other people make them at these
facilities that are fucking trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't give a shit who's making the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just need seed to put in a shell,
the cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as there's a physical seed there,
they're good because they don't give a
[SPEAKER_03]: fuck what happens to it afterwards as
everybody saw it with the candy rain
[SPEAKER_03]: incident, fuck these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody cares.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the majority of what people have in
their collections was made ghostbred.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was ghostbred or made in Spain or
Colombia, and they just have no clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, like you were implying earlier,
ghost breeding in and of itself isn't a
[SPEAKER_00]: good or bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a context, and in some contexts,
it's perfectly innocuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: In another context, it's perfectly
insidious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's as insidious as you can imagine in
some contexts, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In some, it's very mild, and it's just a
matter of, well, at least you get what you
[SPEAKER_03]: got.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems it's almost the best you can hope
for anymore, and it's sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, at least you got what you
fucking paid for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it wasn't the dude whose face was on
that picture smiling at you, but at least
[SPEAKER_03]: you got what you paid for, and that's sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best we can hope for really.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to hope for a breeder who will
write you back and be like, okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, if you're interested in this line,
here's some traits and blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_03]: blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear about it all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: People email me and are like, dude,
I'm surprised you even responded.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never had anybody respond before,
but it's because people don't understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not because they're busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: People just don't know how to answer the
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have answers to the questions
that you're asking if it's about breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, and that's a reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks to say, and people are probably
going to get pissed that I said it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's a reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great question because it sums up
quite a bit about the industry.
It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's one of the most important
topics to probably recover every now and
[SPEAKER_03]: then just because there's so many new
people coming in that don't know that big,
[SPEAKER_03]: massive part.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it was going on during the mid-2000s,
I was jumping up, screaming, stomping my
[SPEAKER_03]: feet, fucking screaming it from the
rafters, and that's when I was getting
[SPEAKER_03]: banned from every forum back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't something that everybody knew.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was never an open secret back then
even.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just wasn't talked about and you
weren't allowed to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, Matt, every year or every six
months, there are certain topics that are
[SPEAKER_00]: worth revisiting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a good call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, I just off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be fun to get a Europe update.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be fun to get a Thailand update.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be fun for you to do a reflection on
the American industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I really want to do too is a
prediction episode each year, predicting
[SPEAKER_03]: what's going to happen the next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds fun as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: What companies will do what, what
companies will still be around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Squirrel's second question, which is
related, also has to do with some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: politics and complexities of running these
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to know about the legacy of
breeders or seed makers who have died and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the messes or complications around
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any anecdotes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the main one that most people
think of when it comes to messes after
[SPEAKER_03]: people pass would probably be Gorilla
Glue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Josie and Lone, I don't want to use the
real name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knows their names, but Josie and
Lone are the people responsible for
[SPEAKER_03]: Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Near the end, they had tried to do a legal
company and there was a lot of cease and
[SPEAKER_03]: desist sent out saying you can't use
Gorilla Glue for clone, which is a clone
[SPEAKER_03]: that was passed to everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody that was using it, they were
saying cease and desist too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't do it to me because we were
friends, but it wasn't even necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: Josie and Lone that were doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had hired some legal stuff and they
had a friend named Kat who's super nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got along with Kat real well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice person.
[SPEAKER_03]: She ended up being who had Gorilla Glue
after they both passed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was just wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was political.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sat on my Gorilla Glue 4 hybrids because
me and Josie were going to release it as a
[SPEAKER_03]: collab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then after he passed, there was some
lawsuits going on with the company.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, fuck this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not dealing with this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not getting wrapped up in some
lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just sat on him forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know CSI, he released Gorilla Glue in
collaboration with Josie and made sure
[SPEAKER_03]: that his family is still getting money for
it too, which I think is so weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so commendable.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all different ways it's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really depends up to the person how
they handle it, but it's also how the
[SPEAKER_03]: community reacts, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is to say, you can't really ask these
breeders that are passed away if you can
[SPEAKER_03]: use their work.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times, sons pop up like we saw
with Bog.
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually had a real son.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we had fake sons pop up after they
died pretending to sell his gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has happened so many times after
people pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happened with Zochi.
[SPEAKER_03]: When he passed, someone was claiming to be
him selling his seeds, Goat and Monkey.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's horrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the most disgusting,
horrible things I've seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more a recent trend when people die
for someone to pop up, pretend to be their
[SPEAKER_03]: son, and sell their seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's been happening a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one weird segment of this question.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as for me, using Lone Star's Blue
Bonnet specifically, because me and Lone
[SPEAKER_03]: Star weren't tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't enemies by any stretch of
magic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We never argued or anything, but we
weren't tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't friends, and I wasn't close
with his friends that are still around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Approaching the Blue Bonnet stuff was
weird for me, and it still is to this day
[SPEAKER_03]: because I want to make sure that he gets
as much respect as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was beautiful work that made all of the
blueberry stuff that I do that is so super
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did all of the work that made all that
possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm looking at my post, people want
to give me credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole time, I'm like, I didn't really
do much, but people want to give me
[SPEAKER_03]: credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how his friends feel about
that because I don't want to necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: take credit for it, but it keeps getting
put on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so complex, but in the end,
I just try to think about it from my own
perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm gone and the stuff that I had
anything to do with is still passing on
[SPEAKER_03]: and people are still saying my name,
then that's magic.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only way you still live,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way I look at it, but some of
the people may look at it different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, people sue each other over this
shit, so it's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you want to mention TJ or Tony?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a hard one.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's even hard to talk about after
passing, let alone not even talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: using his genetics, just speaking about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of all the things that happened
right before, the last two years got
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty wild and hairy and humans will
human, especially when they find out
[SPEAKER_03]: they're no longer living.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some will make amends with people and some
will live their life to the fullest that
[SPEAKER_03]: they see fit, and that's what happened
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly what I see though in cannabis is
people being sanctified after they pass,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe unjustly sanctified in many ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're given sainthood.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see that a lot, like, oh, this guy,
he was such a fucking amazing breeder,
[SPEAKER_03]: collector.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was legit, knew his shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: When he was alive, he was one of the
biggest, not even talking about the sub,
[SPEAKER_03]: but just, there's a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot, because people are complex
and not everybody's a good human their
[SPEAKER_03]: whole life, and some people are really bad
humans most of their life.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when they die in cannabis,
for some reason, they get sainthood.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think some people may not see that
same fate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of depends who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even people who are alive get that
sainthood, and they may not deserve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of sainthood going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, don't, as we always say,
be very wary of having heroes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kick over the statues, so I say.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, don't worship any statues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't have any pedestals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because breeders are all fuck-ups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of us are ex-junkies too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether they admit it or not, most of us
have shady pasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're a bunch of fuck-ups, there's
nothing to look up to.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for damn sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself included.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a positive note, it is worth
reiterating what you said before,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is that one of the least,
I think, or one of the best things you
[SPEAKER_00]: could do is just continue to gesture
towards the people whose work your work
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on, in general, whether they're
dead or alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always give thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even just give thanks, but just be
thankful.
[SPEAKER_03]: In general, have that in your heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't just say it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have it in your heart and carry it with
you in your projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the Lone Star stuff, I try to think
about that all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't let that slip from the picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's why I don't get ego with it,
because it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just have it in your heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carry that with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't just say it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I think for us at The Syndicate,
it's clearly a core value to acknowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are just one point on a long line
of points, running through time,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that we wouldn't be here without... A
lot of my focus has been trying to find
[SPEAKER_03]: things that other breeders had already
made years ago that's been lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things were made a long time ago that were
so good that we're still digging them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone was doing it right back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good that way better than what we have
now, even.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of a tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think occasionally it's nice to have a
bit more of a philosophical, ethical
[SPEAKER_00]: reflection on these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Breeding ethics is one that I used to get
asked a lot on the live feeds about
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding ethics.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you know if it's okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you ask a breeder?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hard one to do because so many
people have different answers.
[SPEAKER_03]: People go online and they see breeders
have different reactions to people using
[SPEAKER_03]: their stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost think it's silly when people ask
me if they can use my stuff from stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: they bought from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know they're doing it out of respect,
but for me, if you bought a pack of seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do whatever the hell you want with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care whose it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put it out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's there to be put out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you use it,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's nothing more special than seeing
someone that found something so unique and
[SPEAKER_03]: special, they wanted to bring it into
something and make it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That, to me, is the ultimate win for a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: When people get mad, when people use males
from their line or use a female from their
[SPEAKER_03]: line or whatever and want to kick back,
to me, it blows my mind because the
[SPEAKER_03]: respect has already been paid there by
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wanting to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that should be another recurring
episode every year or so, where we do
[SPEAKER_00]: ethics and morals in 2023 and then in
2024.
[SPEAKER_03]: They definitely change over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you what, they have changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be a good thing to revisit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The name game changed completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: The name game, that used to be one of the
most deadly serious games we played in
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding is when we were picking names,
making sure we didn't step on any fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: toes.
[SPEAKER_03]: At one point, there were still names out
there you could use that hadn't been
[SPEAKER_03]: reused if they weren't super obvious.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could have uniqueness in your name
still, but if you weren't too creative,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was very easy to step on toes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't like it is today where people
are like, whatever, because there's so
[SPEAKER_03]: many names you can't avoid, but you're
using names now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back then, people took that very serious
and would message you and be able to watch
[SPEAKER_03]: your head.
[SPEAKER_03]: You better change that now or else.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another thing that's definitely
changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our policy today is, were you here before
me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, fucking kick rocks, kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you here before me?
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get to choose the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get to keep the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dick move, we got to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, slight change of pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: We come back to a much more practical set
of questions, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple one, I think from Freezeblade.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you think is the best time to take
clones or to take cuttings off plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_03]: By it depends, any number of factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a seedling?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mom, is it a clone mom?
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a seedling mom, is it going to
fuck up the whole structure of the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: if I take the clones or am I not really
worried about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's many reasons that I go into when
I'm taking clones or things that I take
[SPEAKER_03]: into account.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this going to be something that I'm
flowering out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I taking clones in a specific spot from
the plant to make it have a specific
[SPEAKER_03]: structure when it's flowering?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big part of what part of the
plant's clones I'm taking, how many I
[SPEAKER_03]: take, the shape of it, that all goes into
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually for me, I wait till it's about two
to three feet tall before I start making
[SPEAKER_03]: clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people do it at the first two nodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once there's a leaf material to take and
there's a node, bam, take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that context, have you experienced or
observed maturity playing a very big role
[SPEAKER_00]: in the success of rooting or not
necessarily?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not good anecdotes that I could give,
but I'm sure there is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hormonally, a plant changes over time,
so I'm sure there is.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm talking about there, they're
already so big at that point that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: not really worried about the maturity as
much.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I run my plants, I usually run veg at
24 hours like almost always.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't think of a situation where I've
been running anything less than 24 hours
[SPEAKER_03]: in veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's constantly on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason I do that is because I do also
do a lot of revegging.
[SPEAKER_03]: In saying that, my plants grow pretty fast
in veg because that lights around 24
[SPEAKER_03]: hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two to three feet, there's no heavy
pre-flowering going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of people taking
cuttings in the flowering stretch?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's quite common slash popular
as well, I guess, because you get so much
[SPEAKER_00]: extra vegetative growth often that you
have to get rid of anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of pulling cuttings at
that point?
[SPEAKER_03]: What point are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Later in flower or early in flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: During the flowering stretch, first few
weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times they'll have stems that'll
root better too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why, but they have woodier
stems.
[SPEAKER_03]: For some reason, I have better luck with
woodier stems like that or harder stems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hormonally, I think for whatever reason,
they're more able to root at that stage,
[SPEAKER_03]: hormonally, because they do root faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found that out just by process of
thinking I had something backed up and
[SPEAKER_03]: clones backed up, going to flower
something, starting in flower and
[SPEAKER_03]: realizing, oh shit, I don't have any more
clones of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then having to take clones that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when I started realizing that there
was a difference between how fast they
[SPEAKER_03]: would root, how well they would root.
[SPEAKER_03]: The type of roots they gave off even.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran into that just by happenstance,
but it is effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take cuttings at that point,
do you have to deal with re-vegging or not
[SPEAKER_00]: really?
[SPEAKER_03]: It just depends sometimes, but usually
it's not a very super long re-veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anything, it's a week or two max.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get it at the right time,
not usually.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll revert pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good juicy bit of info.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love re-vegging.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me sad when people say that they
don't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it's so easy to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a lot of talents in life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even when it comes to growing,
I don't have a lot of talents when it
[SPEAKER_03]: comes to growing, but I'm better at this
than anyone else or better at that than
[SPEAKER_03]: anyone else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really good at re-vegging and I'm
really good at popping seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are two things that I can do
exceptionally well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Re-vegging to me, it's something I could
teach anyone at any time.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you follow a few simple fucking
rules, anybody could do it any time as
[SPEAKER_03]: long as you can put your lights on 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people do have trouble with it
and I don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just one of those things I've never
gotten.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would people have trouble with
re-vegging?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an awesome technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be very patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess to me, the main costs of
re-vegging would be space and time and
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but the 24-hour light, a lot of
people don't want to do that because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like doubling your flower cycle of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
True.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it can get more expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: That extra six hours of light a night.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can move on to diggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question, and I think you had a sense
of what he's asking here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not entirely clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, pros and cons of steering a line
or clone with males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Color flowering time and stability of the
male or male's use.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: What he's talking about, I think,
is using the male as basically a stud,
[SPEAKER_03]: using all of his traits onto the females.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it with a female or with a
male.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing set with all males bring
this trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: All females breed this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so variable down to the plant and
environment on what traits are passed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very hard question to answer,
but yes, you can absolutely, like with the
[SPEAKER_03]: bonnet stuff, that's exactly what I did
was bring towards the male.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was what you would actually consider
a stud because I wanted everything to be
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry that he touched and was
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Historically, it's been done a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very common pattern.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes in the way of like skunk one was used
as a male a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: NL1 was used as a male a lot by Neville,
but overall, there's been a lot of seed
[SPEAKER_03]: making with males.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not been a lot of breeding done
with a male for trait selection like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good distinction.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stone root.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on convergent
evolution through breeding, starting with
[SPEAKER_00]: rather different cultivars, but ending up
in the same place through a series of
[SPEAKER_00]: generations?
[SPEAKER_00]: He says similar to crabs in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you experienced this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'll say though right away is
that crabs in the ocean were not bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: They evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what he means.
[SPEAKER_00]: He means that throughout the different
eras of creatures on the planet,
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a few different species,
I don't know if I have the right taxonomy
[SPEAKER_00]: here, but quite a few different species
have kind of converged on a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology, a very crab-like morphology
throughout time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that is conflatable with
breeding because breeding is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he said two different cultivars,
but that would mean they were both
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the crab thing was meant to be an
analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kind of explaining why the
analogy doesn't really make sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but with this question,
he said two different cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it sounded like he was almost talking
about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just said with different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not even necessarily cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he talking about just two different
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does mean cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I was saying to you before the
recording, the most obvious thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to mind that it's not breeding is
what happens when you just let drug-type
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis go wild, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can watch it regress very quickly to
hemp in a few generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know if this makes sense if
you're talking about it from a breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the only thing I can think of from
a breeding perspective that even remotely
[SPEAKER_03]: comes close to this is someone currently
crossing hops and cannabis, cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two different kind of semi-related plants
and finding a way to interbreed them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not done evolutionarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not done naturally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was done through breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: What he's talking about takes thousands
and thousands and thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like evolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done through evolution, not through
humanity.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless we're talking about major,
major GMO-type stuff, advanced science
[SPEAKER_03]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't know anything about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think you make a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really have evolution and
breeding in the same sentence.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not simpatico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move on to Skrusten Scarecrow's question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he says we men also have talked about
growing for seed versus growing for flower
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about the difference between
having a what he calls a regular veg setup
[SPEAKER_00]: versus a setup that's more for
preservation, I guess, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping moms?
[SPEAKER_00]: How different are those setups?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can they be?
[SPEAKER_02]: How different can they be from seed making
to keeping moms?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think he means like production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what are the differences between
differences between a setup that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using just to like grow plants to grow
plants for, I guess, for cropping versus a
[SPEAKER_00]: setup that's just for keeping stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so if I were doing just cropping,
I would probably be doing a lot in tables.
[SPEAKER_03]: A ton.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm keeping moms, you can't really keep
moms in tables.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know anybody who does.
[SPEAKER_03]: But usually like... Can you explain a bit
why?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because they get so big.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you can't really have those big
monster moms in tables, especially if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're keeping them around a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also depends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like some people like to do clone of their
mom, clone of their mom, clone of the mom,
[SPEAKER_03]: keep it small, constantly clone of the
mom, clone of the mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of work to do it that way and
keep it small.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the way you could do it in
tables, technically.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could also use tables and revege.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's not really any... There's
workarounds for every situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But ideally, like if I have moms,
I have a whole room dedicated to that of
[SPEAKER_03]: just moms in pots, in containers,
in cocoa, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if I'm running production,
whether it's usually if I'm running
[SPEAKER_03]: production for me, I do it all in the same
pots and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's because I rent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I owned a place, I would be doing
all fucking tables all day, all day long.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess the only difference would be
how you keep the moms longer in a mom
[SPEAKER_03]: room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like you were saying earlier,
it depends, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what constraints you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you don't have a lot of space,
then you might have to resort to what you
[SPEAKER_00]: were pointing out before, like what I call
like serial cloning, where you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have a mom that you're constantly
just taking clones off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have like a chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're cloning and then taking a clone off
that clone and doing that successively
[SPEAKER_00]: through time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did that for years, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did it for years that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Solo cup moms, bonsai moms, which is
horrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't understand that I was like super
stunting shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then now I'm going to take that and
breed with this super stunted plant
[SPEAKER_03]: because I made a bonsai mom out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't understand what I was doing back
then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know the ramifications that
has for the future of what I made back
[SPEAKER_03]: then with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, just thinking about that,
that was the stunted moms and recycled
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a really big question that
I think we still don't really have great
[SPEAKER_00]: answers for, which is, yeah, like you say,
let's say you have a mom and then you've
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of had to, you've been forced to
stress slash traumatize it in various ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep it small.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of impact that does have on
clones you take off it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even the seeds that you make with it
epigenetically.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what happens there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe this is something, you know,
if anyone in the community has an idea or
[SPEAKER_00]: has seen any theory around this,
like definitely let us know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kymira, if you want, just let me know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the other side of this in terms of
setup is like, I can think of things like
[SPEAKER_00]: basic things that you probably probably
have already thought through, like what
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of other differences in like,
say, light intensity, the feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've covered a bit of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feeding definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Light intensity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a weird one.
[SPEAKER_03]: A kind of it's on the topic, but kind of a
tangent.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of us are getting news like a lot of
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like the oldest ones of us are
just getting used to LEDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're just getting to try them for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is so fucking different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how the plants eat and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so massively different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I mean, there are a lot of things
to take into account too, just from light
[SPEAKER_03]: intensities on feed and all that shit,
not just for breeding, but for anything,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I'm someone who's only ever
had LEDs, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's a trip for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I started on magnetic ballast and T5s
and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I still have T5s that I would
use because I'm fucking old.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I think that's a legit
technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never, I've never moved on to LEDs
mostly because I'm broke and cheap,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if anybody wants to be an LED sponsor,
get ahold of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to use this shit.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else about the differences
between, you know, keeping plants for an
[SPEAKER_00]: archive versus keeping plants for
production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any changes in your, obviously it's a
different mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, obviously it's a different
strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if nothing else.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's, I can't think of anything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can move on to South coast Kanner's
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Random one, but does a male have different
traits as a, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess what he's asking here is how
differently can a male plant, but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't have to be just about a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: How differently can a plant express when
seed ground versus like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, as a cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vastly different, vastly different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's why I always say like, if you're
really serious about it, about like a line
[SPEAKER_03]: and hunting through it, do run at all as
seeds, flower them, and then run it as
[SPEAKER_03]: clones before you toss them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause sometimes that change might be so
drastic that the turps changed so far that
[SPEAKER_03]: you might've already tossed a keeper if
you haven't run it the second time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you break this down a little bit,
Matt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know that like in the past,
whatever I remember you saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I know, for example, that the
expression of, um, intersex expressions
[SPEAKER_00]: change a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but now you're actually saying that
even turf expressions might be different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scent, um, inter node spacing,
all kinds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cause it's, there's so many different
hormones packed into that seedling mom,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is why it grows so different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you, as it ages, as you take clones
of that, those hormones start to wear out,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and you get to see a totally
different plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just grows totally different as a,
as a clone, different root system,
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that for me anyway,
I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no main taproot on a, on a clone,
you know, like there's not like that big
[SPEAKER_03]: hard main taproot like a seedling gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another one where I think,
you know, there probably is quite a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: science underneath and if anyone can chip
in on this topic, we could probably
[SPEAKER_00]: revisit this because it is quite an
interesting and big one.
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, was there anything else in terms of
differences that you could think of just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, beyond the fact that they are
going to be potentially pretty major ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: any anecdotes in particular, Matt,
that you can think of or, um, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just something that we see every
single time that we run a plant like every
[SPEAKER_03]: single time it's going to change from,
um, seedling and not all of them change
[SPEAKER_03]: strategies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, domestically, some, some are real
minor changes, just, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a leaf shape, um, with sometimes you just
see that are a little bit stockier,
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit longer, but sometimes it can
be worlds apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, that bubble gum clone of the
Northern lights five was so pink bubble
[SPEAKER_03]: gum.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we first got it, you're blown mind
blown by it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as a, as a clone, about third
generation in it's a lot less pink bubble
[SPEAKER_03]: gummy, a lot less.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is a, this is a fascinating
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of complexity here is a tone and it
is very sciencey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we've got a couple of questions from
in the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think generally what I get from in
the wind's questions here is he's taken
[SPEAKER_00]: into account some of the theory that we've
explained in the previous episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on some of the complexities of
breeding, like we pointed out,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, linked linked traits, IE genes that
are linked or grouped together for
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, the inverse of that we
talked about, I think where we,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could even have multiple genes
controlling a single trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so for me, the vibe I get from him
is like, okay, that, that, that sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like breeding is like impossible or like
intentional breeding is impossible because
[SPEAKER_00]: of these conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously it's, it's true that it's
extremely difficult to, to make
[SPEAKER_00]: predictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but okay, we'll get into his first
one, which is how much of our assessment
[SPEAKER_00]: of linked traits and true breeding traits,
um, can actually be observed in like,
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually be observed full stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's kind of what I see in this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says how much of it is like visual,
um, and can be perceived through effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of it's visual except for effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think, am I correct in
saying that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like most of the traits that we breed for
are visual observable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Observable is better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Consent is not, you know, but observable
in some way, except for the high.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always going to be variable for
every single person, every single
[SPEAKER_03]: different time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like trying to explain this to the,
the like normal person who goes into a
[SPEAKER_03]: collective, they're so mindset on
thinking, Ooh, do I need the TV or hybrid?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like that's where their
mindset's at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas like in my mindset, I'm at,
I wonder if this bud from this plant is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to affect me the same way it did
last night when I was in a different mood,
[SPEAKER_03]: because re in reality, that's where we
should be at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's that variable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So trying to quantify high and breeding
for high, very hard, very hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you never know if the next person's
going to have the same higher,
[SPEAKER_03]: the same reaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't know that if you're going to
have the same higher reaction,
[SPEAKER_03]: the next time you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in some sense, it can be two variable
to account for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are variables we can account for
and breed for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of those questions where
like, there isn't a straightforward
[SPEAKER_00]: answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it depends on what traits you are
interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, within, within the tools
that you have, like if all you have are
[SPEAKER_00]: your observations, then obviously you can
only, um, you can only depend on what you
[SPEAKER_00]: observe to make your decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's just, there's no magic
shortcut to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you don't have access to,
you know, other kinds of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is where knowing your baselines,
having experience running out the
[SPEAKER_03]: baselines, going through populations in
the baselines and for baselines,
[SPEAKER_03]: see our previous episodes, recent
episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, having that experience will help you
to make those selections and see those
[SPEAKER_03]: traits that you're looking for and know,
okay, well, it breeds about this common in
[SPEAKER_03]: this line.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about that common.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully I'll see it in this,
you know, roughly this percentage in this
[SPEAKER_03]: population of this hybrid, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, the more you load,
know the lines you're working with or
[SPEAKER_03]: clones you're working with, the more
educated you can be about making those
[SPEAKER_03]: distinctions and projections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we, we did talk about this as
well, which is that sometimes you do have
[SPEAKER_00]: to go forward and then go backwards
because you just don't have any other way
[SPEAKER_00]: of getting more information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's literally, you have to run
the progeny and not everything's ahead,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his second question is, I think we've
more or less covered it, but I'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll sound it out anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said, uh, yeah, how reliable is a,
you know, visual, uh, sorry, observable
[SPEAKER_00]: slash like smoke tests in the search for
unique expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he kind of goes into like,
uh, is it possible for something to not
[SPEAKER_00]: express the trait in its first expression?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess he means in the first generation
and then for that trait to appear in
[SPEAKER_00]: successive generations, obviously yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very much so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's how recessives work, you know,
they pop up in the F3s, F3s, you'll never
[SPEAKER_03]: see them in the F1s, um, or in that first
generation crotch, I should say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, that's, that's, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's a part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a major thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I perceive underlying this
question, his, his real question is how
[SPEAKER_00]: can I predict this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, it's the same answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, either you have very good
information and previous experience on
[SPEAKER_00]: how, what you're holding, um, does pass
and breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you're going to have to actually do
some work, test the progeny and maybe do
[SPEAKER_00]: another generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you're looking,
you know, if you're trying to trace
[SPEAKER_00]: something down generations, you just have,
you can't avoid actually doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially, you know, in, in,
to this point, like I would rather see
[SPEAKER_03]: someone pop a hundred seeds in a very
small space and flower them small to get
[SPEAKER_03]: an idea of the population, then run two or
three plants really big to try to get an
[SPEAKER_03]: idea of what a clone's like.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like if, if people are
wondering, like, which would be better,
[SPEAKER_03]: which would be more ideal, which would
give them the most information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the smaller plants would give you the
most information and that would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, smaller plants can be just as chirpy
and potent as anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we're going for assessing and
learning about a plant, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: as long as it has enough bud to get you a
few fucking bulls, so you can get a pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's even a high, you enjoy,
you personally enjoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, I mean, just flower them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little clones, little, little seedlings.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess my paraphrase for that is
whenever you are looking for stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you face significant odds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only strategy that's viable is to
go with numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Numbers always.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we can move on.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: NJ Grow Guy is asking a question that I
think, you know, is always the question in
[SPEAKER_00]: a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what is the best way to go about
extending stock on a pack of seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a 12 pack and want to make more so
I can grow them out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you just OP that pack or would you
go and select, um, you know, maybe do one
[SPEAKER_00]: to one with your, like your favorite from
the pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, so I, in this case, you know what
I'd say?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say if you have like 12 seeds,
I'd run them all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep clones of each just in case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if it's already an open pollination,
there might not be a need to do a
[SPEAKER_03]: successive open pollination unless it's
solely for preservation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, you feel like the last person
probably didn't do that good of a job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if someone just did it from five
seeds, I would probably re-OP it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, you know, just because to bring out
more examples, but, um, yeah, I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Open pollinations are great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if, if this is solely for
preservation, do open pollinations,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's some lines where it's like,
someone just didn't open pollination and
[SPEAKER_03]: it won't kill you to just do little
selections from it to make the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would be doing directional breeding in
a sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And start that direction narrowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, if it's plants that you like,
as opposed to just random and you've
[SPEAKER_03]: already run them, then yeah, that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think again, this is one of those,
like, it depends and it comes down to your
[SPEAKER_00]: constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I imagine the risk with OP is that I
think we did address this in the theory
[SPEAKER_00]: episode as well, is that it's easy to lose
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's not to say that you've lost
them forever, but that's why I say it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes down to your constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have plenty of time in the future
and you know, you're going to have lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe an OP is okay, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're like, if you're doing an OP
strictly, so you can do a big ass pop of
[SPEAKER_03]: this one line, that makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're just OP in it, just to pop
three seeds, that doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good, that's a good
summary statement.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patty cheetah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've selected a stable female from an
intersex prone line and out-crossed it to
[SPEAKER_00]: a male from a stable line.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your experience, despite choosing a
stable individual, how often do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: the intersex traits from the female side
get passed into the progeny?
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends again, cause we don't know if
that trait is a link trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't know much about that trait,
you know, like for this particular
[SPEAKER_03]: example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically, typically, generally speaking
though, if you're, if you're breeding away
[SPEAKER_03]: from intersex traits, let's say this line
is very, very arm prone and you find a
[SPEAKER_03]: male from a line that's just super stable
sexually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually you're doing a great service to
line.
[SPEAKER_03]: If your end goal is to have no intersex
traits, that's, that's what you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, that's, that's the best method
for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's the trait you're trying to like,
suppress, that's how you would do it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, squirrel again is asking, let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think his question is we often
address, uh, traits such as, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most common ones like, uh,
scent, um, color, color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's wondering, like, and we have
talked a bit about this before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but do you have much experience with
people who have bred for bud structure for
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking specifically?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, not that I know of, but I mean,
maybe someone does out there that's an
[SPEAKER_03]: actual breeder, but I don't know of it and
I haven't had that discussion with anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I've talked about it because I,
I hate, I fucking hate with a passion,
[SPEAKER_03]: super dense bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I like to break up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, my preference has always been to break
it up by hand really easy, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: not, not thumb it up super bad,
but I don't know how to handle bud,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, but I like to break it up by
hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And pretty much nowadays I have to use a
grinder every single time because this
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff is so dense that it would just,
it's pointless to try to break it apart
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't like shit that dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, and a lot of customers don't eat
it because it's usually mold prone,
[SPEAKER_03]: like massively mold prone stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I was, I was going to say that
even if people in their work haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: explicitly looking for, um, flower
structure relative to smoking,
[SPEAKER_00]: people certainly pay attention to how
prone flowers are to bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is often the kind of corresponding
consideration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it definitely is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially for the grower side,
more dense, more density means more mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, that's why I just can,
I never could believe that cookies blew up
[SPEAKER_03]: like it did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only was it a smaller yielder,
but the density just made it a mold
[SPEAKER_03]: nightmare for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it just blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question here for you,
Matt, which, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Indiana bubble gum cut is often cited
for being really mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you, uh, in your opinion, like,
is it partly the structure of the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: that contributes to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it other, are the other qualities
you think, I mean, I, it's, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as dense as like cookies,
but it's very dense Afghani type.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just one of those things where the
genetics, it's just very mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an example where it wasn't,
it wasn't, it's not necessarily because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower structure that it's mold
resistant.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, um, a lot of the herb beer stuff,
the Swiss sativa strawberry stuff also
[SPEAKER_03]: tends to be mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't, like early on I was trying to
figure out if it was tied to its scent,
[SPEAKER_03]: like whatever the oils are in its glands,
you know, whatever, I never figured it
[SPEAKER_03]: out, but the strawberry stuff is extremely
mold resistant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I guess, yeah, paraphrase of that is
the other obvious way something can be
[SPEAKER_00]: mold resistant is presumably through its
cannabinoid, like the balance and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that might actually be the end of our
questions today, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we are at the end of the
questions, I know that you wanted to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which one should I talk about first?
[SPEAKER_00]: So did you want to talk about your,
your recent experience with cereal milk
[SPEAKER_00]: and tell us what that is?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you about my experience,
the rundown on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to check out some of these new
buds because I had not tried cereal milk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had not tried jealousy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a bunch I hadn't tried from a lot
of the hype stuff, not just cookie cam
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, but in general, generally speaking,
um, a lot of the newer stuff I haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: tried.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people ask me a lot about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my normal comment is, well,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it cookies crossed to cookies?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably trash, you know, like in my
opinion, that's usually what you get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I got some and I probably should
have taken pictures, but I figured it's
[SPEAKER_03]: cereal milk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm probably not going to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, I was that confident that I
would not enjoy this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that is a bias coming with the
bias to not wanting to enjoy this and not
[SPEAKER_03]: even not wanting to, but expecting to not
enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the bud shows up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, expected.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the density is just, exactly like I
hate hard to break up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's not a lot of scent to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was expecting cereal milk to smell like
the sweet end of OG that actually smells
[SPEAKER_03]: like cereal milk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I thought the name would be
apropos and some kind of extension of
[SPEAKER_03]: that, because that exists in that line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you not choose that expression
to represent it?
[SPEAKER_03]: But they didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think the name is a misnomer scent
wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very bland, um, turps, which also
threw me off as far as like, I'm expecting
[SPEAKER_03]: this to not be very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's surplus incense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't really even pin down the scent for
you on what it smelled like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just hashy maybe at best.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I smoke it and about 30 minutes in,
I'm already expecting this thing to be
[SPEAKER_03]: over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I'm actually enjoying this.
I'm giggly.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is giggly weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had been dabbing diamonds in sauce all
day and it broke through and it repeatedly
[SPEAKER_03]: did that until the very last bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because I, I spent so much time talking
about like cookies being the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding, as far as like the, the very end
of where you can take that line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't know much about snowman and
wildlife.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously it's some kind of cookies,
cookies, you know, but I was impressed and
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt like I would like, even though I
want so badly not to say that cereal milk
[SPEAKER_03]: is, is decent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was pretty fucking decent and I
was surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because I talked so much shit,
I had to actually, you know, man up and
[SPEAKER_03]: save it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I'm going to try to do that more
often, grab some stuff now and then from
[SPEAKER_03]: newer stuff and you know, maybe do some
reviews for people so that they can see it
[SPEAKER_03]: and get an idea of someone who's more used
to old school strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: What my opinion would be on stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's worth the shakes, I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hella surprised that I would even
run that clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was that good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though it was turpless,
I like, I wouldn't, if I was an extractor,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would never run that shit, but the high
from it was exceptional.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I don't think the grower was
anything special, but I do think that I
[SPEAKER_03]: was exceptional.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I got to give them props where
it's due.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had someone make them a good line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess it's still consistent,
you know, despite with what we say,
[SPEAKER_00]: like despite, of course us enjoying
bashing on cookies for various good
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's obviously no reason why,
uh, outliers within that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: can't appear and be good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the part that blew my mind
though, was that it didn't look like
[SPEAKER_03]: anything different than a gelato,
you know, nothing different than gelato
[SPEAKER_03]: 33.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd look at it and be like, Oh,
that's a lot of 33.
[SPEAKER_03]: The smell, nothing to write home about at
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, it was one of the more scentless
buds that I've ever had, but for whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: reason, and like that totally shits on
that entourage effect type thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it totally, it's the opposite of how
it should have worked in my brain,
[SPEAKER_03]: if that's real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it did it and it had a great
fucking high, like markedly great,
[SPEAKER_03]: something that I don't see in cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's, it's definitely,
um, that, that clone at least,
[SPEAKER_03]: or the, the example, maybe maybe it wasn't
even cereal milk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who fucking knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: It came from a dispensary, so God knows,
but I'm pretty sure it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, yeah, it was impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the implications of this
statement, Matt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you, are you telling everyone that
cookies is great in that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to blow burner is what's going
to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make me, he's my puppy,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what this means, but it's,
uh, what it means is that I need to start
[SPEAKER_03]: giving some of these new things to try and
see if, if, uh, I can't break some of my
[SPEAKER_03]: own myths that I have in my head about
them, or I can't prove myself right,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm determined now to at least like
maybe once a week, if I can afford it,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's expensive, man, legal weeds,
expense the taxes on this unreal,
[SPEAKER_03]: unreal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I would like to do that once a week,
you know, grab some, grab one,
[SPEAKER_03]: even one or two things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, like another thing that
I got that I, that I'd like to talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: that blew my mind to mango haze diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it didn't blow my mind for the reasons
that you think it would.
[SPEAKER_03]: It blew my mind that someone would grow
like a 14 to 16 week plant and then
[SPEAKER_03]: extract it down to diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who came up with that idea and why did I
buy it?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was no scent to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't have an exceptional high at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was nothing mango hazy about the
high to me, you know, like if it was used,
[SPEAKER_03]: if it was a real 14, 16 week grown mango
haze, it was lost in the extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, I don't see any of these people
running a 14 to 16 week haze and
[SPEAKER_03]: extracting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's probably ran at eight and
extracted, you know, and at that point you
[SPEAKER_03]: just have THC diamonds and you could have
that from anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wouldn't matter because there's no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing else with it, except just THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a very, very specific high,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it was almost offensive that
mango haze diamonds existed and I couldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: believe they existed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I even tried them in hopes that they
would be something good, that they would
[SPEAKER_03]: just work diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can, I can totally see why it's
offensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like sacrilegious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why, why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they could have done live resin sauce
and I've been like fucking dope,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they did diamonds, like straight,
just THC diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In which case, why would you use something
like mango haze?
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: You could use anything on earth to do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you use a 14, 16 week plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was my experience at the local
collectives.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some, a funny tale was that the
place where I got the Juicy Fruit Tie
[SPEAKER_03]: Clone, I had Juicy Fruit on their menu
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're growing that again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was going to order it, but I didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember why, because I was buying
everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was too damn expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, you know, but they gave me a full
free ounce of their Juicy Fruit and holy
[SPEAKER_03]: balls was the most moldy bullshit I've
ever seen in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't even identify if it was Juicy
Fruit or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I had to be the dickhead that
hits them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Hey bro, that stuff you're
giving out, it's all moldy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want to check that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it doesn't look good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like even though it's free, like you're
repping your business.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't say which business because they're
nice and obviously they have my address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's a great idea for you to
periodically, I don't know how often,
[SPEAKER_00]: get some products to review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like for me, you know, I have no other
connection to dispensary land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can vicariously live through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's, that was my experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, um, what else did I get?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some, something called Inferno OG
diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that actually was like, had some
really loud, loud OG sense to it in the
[SPEAKER_03]: diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really fucking impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was some of the best diamonds in
the sauce I've ever had, but it was just
[SPEAKER_03]: diamonds, but I didn't really see any
sauce, but it was so loud OG smelling.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was exactly like I would have wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there was some, um, Mars OG,
the place was selling and that was just
[SPEAKER_03]: absolute garbage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, uh, just really poorly grown,
like Athena grown, you know, just fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: smashed with nudes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not like a really nice OG scent to
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I like her flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was God.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just earthy, really disappointing
to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I used to love Mars OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a really good OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, eh, I can't really think of anything
else that, that jumped out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, uh, of note.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a Jack Harrow live resin sauce.
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't that good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't that special.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't even that turpinoli,
which is weird for a Jack Harrow live
[SPEAKER_03]: resin sauce, but it was in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just wasn't as loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Overall disappointing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really do collectives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've never really done that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had been a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it usually, if I'd ever got anything
from a collective, it would be a clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that interested me and I'm like,
Oh, let's see if that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, what a trip, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: The taxes, the trash level of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it surprisingly though,
like I said, some of it was fucking good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to get something decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess you could say the same of
like collectives and dispensaries as,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you just did about, as we did about
cookies in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like obviously it doesn't mean that like
they're all bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just what the likelihood is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and yeah, there's obviously still a
chance that you can get some, some good
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's funny is some of my friends are the
people growing wheat for cookies that goes
[SPEAKER_01]: in those mylars, you know, like,
yeah, some of it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a good point to like do a little
bit of an outro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, maybe this is where we talk about,
well, we've decided that this is the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of this season.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, this episode that's one of the series
end of everything by we're done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've covered everything that there's
nothing else to say about anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I think that's it for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I didn't want to point out is
that we just hit 7,000 subs, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I'll tell you why I'm proud of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons is that I occasionally
go and look at other cannabis channels,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially ones that I really hate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I've noticed that I think is
so absurd, but also so unsurprising is
[SPEAKER_00]: that some of these channels you go and
then you see they've got like 100 or like
[SPEAKER_00]: 200,000 subs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you go and look at their,
the actual views that they get on their
[SPEAKER_00]: videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like a couple of thousand every
video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of these channels don't have
real subscribers or if they do,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're a tiny portion of the numbers that
they claim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what I've loved seeing from our
data, our analytics is that our subscriber
[SPEAKER_00]: base is real because a good portion of
people show up every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so not only have we grown organically,
we actually have a proper regular
[SPEAKER_00]: following.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is something that you
can't take for granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't think that this,
I'm not trying to like be too
[SPEAKER_00]: self-deprecating or anything, but you
know, what we, the kinds of information
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're interested in are very niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we may not get, or may not even
want to have a hundred thousand subs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to be able to develop a proper close
following with regular people showing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's very special in content
land.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never thought it would happen for
cannabis genetics because it is so niche.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes certain type of personalities to
be this into learning about what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking, why it's affecting you the way it
does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like keeping track, like the whole
provenance of everything and just trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to get to the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's super fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot of weirdos like us out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So every time that I see like our
subscriber count growing, it tells me
[SPEAKER_03]: there's more people that are fascinated by
this topic and deeply fascinated by it at
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that it blows my fucking mind because
I just watching the forums over the years,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, just a few hundred people
interacting on each one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the best you'd get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of them are really mean and
weren't there for good reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are all like our, our community
is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I died tomorrow, it would run itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's so fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I mean, I feel like that's
possibly an exaggeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you could die tomorrow and
this run, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, no, hopefully we won't see.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm calling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm calling a hit on Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thousand point show from New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Live from New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reader's etiquette.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was I going to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my paraphrase of what Matt just
said though is that what makes me happy is
[SPEAKER_00]: that there are people who are interested
in finding out the truth or at least as
[SPEAKER_00]: much of the truth as they can,
because that's what we're into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is, it is heartwarming to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is encouraging to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other side of, I think this ending the
season on this note, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we, we, we covered the whole breeding
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really comprehensive and our,
I found myself actually quite exhausted
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards and like not knowing what we,
what kinds of, what other episodes we
[SPEAKER_00]: could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but in saying that, I think Matt and
I have some good ideas for the next
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we are also toying with some,
like trying out some new kinds of content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it'll actually come to
fruition, but like we joked at least about
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe doing reaction videos to like strain
hunters or maybe like burners,
[SPEAKER_00]: like funny documentaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe we'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm also thinking about doing like
watching UFO videos and getting really
[SPEAKER_03]: fucked up and commenting on them as
reaction videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you already kind of do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I don't, I don't record it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like let people watch me do stupid
shit and talk over UFO videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might be funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say stupid shit when I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we, we've definitely also got a
few guests in mind, a couple of whom we've
[SPEAKER_00]: actually like lined up and, and a few more
of whom we still need to line up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still plenty more good stuff to come.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know what I love that this season
thousand fold got to figure out how hard
[SPEAKER_03]: it is to run the show behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get people communicate and like,
you know, it's not as easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the funny thing is that, you know,
I can, I kind of look back on a week and
[SPEAKER_00]: count the hours and be like, Oh,
it's not, it's not that much, but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: what happened, why it feels kind of like
it, it stretches throughout the week is
[SPEAKER_00]: because yeah, at the start of the week,
we have to decide what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have to try to coordinate like the
planning and recording of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course it actually gets
published later in the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually kind of like an endless
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I think now I'm like,
now that I've seen what I've seen,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like forcing Matt into more and more
like organization being like, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to start like scheduling things in
advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make a list, like a schedule
of episodes that we can cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, he has no idea what he's in for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the, I'm the opposite of schedule and
organization.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt's put up with like, Matt's kind of
been really open to like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I've had to bring so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's good shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I think everybody, all the
feedback has been great for this season.
[SPEAKER_03]: People really enjoyed the content they've
enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people really enjoyed
being able to have some like from point A
[SPEAKER_03]: to point B to point C to point D as
opposed to trying to look at through my
[SPEAKER_03]: ADHD brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's everything that I produce is
very spastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's just left up to me to bring it to
be, it's just how I do things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just random thoughts at all times.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think people really have enjoyed
being able to like follow along and
[SPEAKER_03]: actually follow along.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking forward to the next season too,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all I had to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you know, go to righttease.com for
your spray seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We carry stuff from all the Canna Luminati
dudes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, goat farm, iron lonesome, even got
some Panda stuff on the freebies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably going to have some Panda stuff in
the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like carried.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, who else?
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the rev smellboat CSI collabs with
not so right now we've got the,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, the few cherry pie collabs up that
they just did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go check those out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just dropped.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, of course our community is
really, really been built through our
[SPEAKER_03]: Patreon discord.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's made a family.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's made an absolute family.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love some of these people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's gonna be a lot of lifelong
friends built out of that place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people really genuinely care about
each other, taking care of each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's insane to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you can be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, for as much as a coffee a month,
like you can be a part of that and chill
[SPEAKER_03]: and hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically it keeps the trolls out and
it's a really awesome place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know roughly how many people we
have as members on the server?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's about 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least on the discord, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it got up to 900 at one point and
then cleared it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that included the free people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The free people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: They were free.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And occasionally we'll do that again.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll open it up for free.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people can get like an idea of what
goes on in there and see if it's something
[SPEAKER_03]: they're even into.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some people are tentative about
discord and chat rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And interacting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of people that just kind of,
you know, snoop from the background and
[SPEAKER_03]: learn as they go and don't interact much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's totally fine too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then there's people who get up in
the mix and, you know, don't shut up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a great community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be up to, it'll be at least in part
to Shawnee because like either Shawnee is
[SPEAKER_00]: either feeling really good about people
and wants to open it up or he's being like
[SPEAKER_00]: a total troll and wants to open it up so
that he can like kick some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see which one you guys are.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel free to come hang out with us anytime
we do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I say, it's not, when I say 24 seven,
I don't mean I'm literally in there 24
[SPEAKER_03]: seven, but it's discord.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we pop in and out all hours of the day,
all of us, not so included, all of us,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, um, so come hang out with us,
chill, sit for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, hopefully you'll enjoy what we
have to bring to Breeders Syndicate in the
[SPEAKER_03]: coming months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I just want to reiterate,
like if you've, if you missed not,
[SPEAKER_00]: so he is still very much, um, present and
engaged and active on the server.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just not letting him out until we get
10 K.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it just, he's my slave and that's how
it's going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
