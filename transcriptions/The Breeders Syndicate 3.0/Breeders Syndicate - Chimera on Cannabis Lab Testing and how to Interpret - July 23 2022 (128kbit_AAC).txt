[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been sort of pukey all day,
so hopefully this will go smooth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Natsu made it safe to Oregon last
night, but he's not back yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe he is, maybe he's gonna pop in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I haven't talked to him
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe he'll pop up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully he will.
[SPEAKER_04]: But soon we will have Chimera from Chimera
Seeds, legend of the BC scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I'm just getting everything
ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's a good site?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, let me just try, let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna try to find a good site for tests
to go over, and I brought my tablet out
[SPEAKER_03]: just to do that, but I have no fucking
clue where the internet even is on this
[SPEAKER_03]: tablet.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think is a good site,
like SE Labs or something?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think of a few different
ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll kind of mirror one, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if we can find him yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in here, Chimera, just raise
your hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not here yet, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: My nose recovered from yesterday,
what'd I do yesterday?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the scent stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a headache for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole house smelled like artificial
grape.
[SPEAKER_04]: All night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was fun, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very interesting and informative.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did any of you guys pick up a kit after,
to try it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wanna do another episode where a
bunch of us have kits, and we can all do
[SPEAKER_04]: it, so you guys can all type in here,
like what's going on, what you're
[SPEAKER_04]: smelling, et cetera, and get a good handle
on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much are they, the kits?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seriously having a look.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever they are, they're probably worth
it, you know, because they're pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we could do a group workshop over on
Discord, as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Natsu is in travel mode.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as I know, I haven't talked to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He may pop up, for all I know,
but I haven't heard from him, to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Bitter, is Natsu home yet,
do you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: 175 for the advanced kit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's about right, makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: The site was, it's a long site,
paraphernaliasocial.com, so you have to
[SPEAKER_04]: know how to spell paraphernalia,
but social.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm gonna start out, no,
actually, I already did it yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta read this thing again,
once Kymira gets here, so I can be
[SPEAKER_04]: profesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys like my profesh fucking mode?
[SPEAKER_04]: The 2.0?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would win in a cage match,
me or him?
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, don't be silly, don't be silly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't go beating up on Chads,
I don't do that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even dislike in-house that much,
I just, I don't like how that situation
[SPEAKER_04]: went.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't, I don't have any respect
for him for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The terms, which terms?
[SPEAKER_04]: The terms, the terps?
[SPEAKER_04]: The terms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, we're just waiting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanna get the crowd up a little bit,
I know Saturdays are weird for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I didn't watch the fights earlier,
too, I was sick, I didn't even realize
[SPEAKER_03]: they were on so early, but it was a London
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like Patty Pimlet fucking chucked
that dude out, and Gustafson lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which sucks, I like Gus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's the guy that commented and had you
change the trademark?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember the name, dude,
it was in an old, you could probably find
[SPEAKER_04]: the post still on Instagram, because it
was done in a, unless it's gotten
[SPEAKER_04]: reported, because all my shit got reported
for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, I can't remember the name.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dude did end up being nice,
like at the end of the conversation,
[SPEAKER_04]: and along the thread, we were laughing at
each other, but yeah, started out a little
[SPEAKER_04]: contentious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you guys love staring at my ugly
fucking head right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we all wanna see.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys got any questions in the
meantime, till we get started,
[SPEAKER_04]: so we can kill some time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Any comments, questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Concerns?
[SPEAKER_04]: Questions about UFOs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Questions about fucking serial killers?
[SPEAKER_04]: Questions about whatever?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything you guys got questions about,
I'll take them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you, I try to have the most
beautiful noggin possible, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I get sick of staring at my fucking head.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm staying sober for this one too,
because Chimera talks way over my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy is brilliant, and when it comes to
science, it's really hard to find anyone
[SPEAKER_04]: who is as competent with science and
breeding science, when it comes to that,
[SPEAKER_04]: as him.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'm trying to keep my shit together
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not tested out the Purple Pro yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know CSI got one, but I don't think he's
had even time to touch it or use it or do
[SPEAKER_04]: anything with it yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the S or C silent in the word scent?
[SPEAKER_04]: God, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the BB stuff you've done, anything
without cast cut from nugs and jug days?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not, no one ever passed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why didn't you stick your pinky out when
you sip your tea?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is coffee, it's actually half calf
coffee, because yesterday I drank full
[SPEAKER_04]: calf coffee.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was up all night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Steep hill labs do cannabinoid and trip
testing?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know much about any of the labs,
which is a reason why we're doing the
[SPEAKER_04]: show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully Chimera remembers it's on this
account and not the other one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if I can send an invitation to
him somehow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, breeding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure I got him on the right one.
[SPEAKER_04]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, no, he's not from America.
[SPEAKER_04]: So welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, let me get it going.
[SPEAKER_04]: From Chimera Seeds in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Not from America.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing, dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad, how you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nato may or may not show up at some point,
but we're going to get started without
[SPEAKER_04]: him.
[SPEAKER_04]: All good.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got to read this up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to make it more professional
because we're doing the 2.0 Breeder
[SPEAKER_04]: Syndicate and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have to read this thing and then
we'll get jamming.
Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Breeder Syndicate, where we
explore the history of a clandestine scene
[SPEAKER_04]: through the eyes of the folks who lived
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Matt, the owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Chimera, owner of Chimera Seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was so professional.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do we have some, is there a good place
to look up the labs aspect?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like different labs that I could put,
I have my tablet right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder the best way to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm going to do is I'm going
to send you a text message with a sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: A report format that I will do is,
um, the designing the way it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: but really we can use anything,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The important thing is that we go through
a lab report and show people what are the
[SPEAKER_01]: things to look at?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you like, obviously in lab
reports, there's all this built in
[SPEAKER_01]: information, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can you take that information and
essentially infer things about the results
[SPEAKER_01]: or see if you can identify problems with
what the lab has done?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, what you sent me the
other day, and I think you got those
[SPEAKER_01]: posted on your IG or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're posted on the IG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people can check those out either now
or later, but you know, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the things I said to you back then
was that, um, it wasn't really,
[SPEAKER_01]: like that was, those were results that
somebody had cut and paste into a
[SPEAKER_01]: spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an opportunity for like anybody
to manipulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody can fuck with it at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In an Excel spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lab report is essentially like a legal
document in a way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are legal documents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they are legal documents?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when it comes to like,
you know, obviously there's all this
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental testing that needs to be
done, but in the context of regulations,
[SPEAKER_01]: like these are, these are legal documents
that certify something for the purpose of
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that happens to be done to like a good
standard, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know why I'm not having a lot
of luck sending, sending this thing over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll bring up a picture and you
might want to actually go in and copy the
[SPEAKER_01]: link from the picture, but, um,
this lab report is called the Phytofax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're developed by Napro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually, it's an image search.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what comes up for you,
but it's the top left picture on that
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: One sec.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to switch off here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it, it'll, it'll pause me for a
second.
[SPEAKER_05]: One sec.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You looked really crazy when you were
frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you had the really bizarre look.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it'll even let me show
pictures on here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might just have to copy and paste the
link in, or you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll put it up on our IG after.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people, yeah, let's put it up on the IG
after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially like, look, when you get
back, when most places give you back a lab
[SPEAKER_01]: report, I mean, we're looking at,
even if we're just talking cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking at like minimum 12
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like, I guess it's probably
important to talk like a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: lab testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's various ways there's different
assays that you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's different tests that you can
run to try and determine the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: content of a sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you put it into a GC, a GC has got
something called, um, what is it called?
[SPEAKER_01]: The injection port on GC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like putting what you do is you take
up, you take, think about you,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you got your bud and put it in some
alcohol or some methanol or something
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to extract the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You more or less shake it up and then you
take like one microliter of the liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: that has now dissolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got your ethanol, but now you've
got all the stuff that came off the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we want to do is we take,
we take a small sample of that liquid,
[SPEAKER_01]: call it like a thousandth of a milliliter
and that gets injected into this injection
[SPEAKER_01]: port of the, of the gas chromatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what that does is it takes the
liquid that we have with all of our stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: inside it and it makes it into a vapor
that, that injection port is heated like
[SPEAKER_01]: 300 degrees.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are 350 degrees Celsius or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the point is, is when you put that shit
in, in the lick or sorry, that liquid into
[SPEAKER_01]: the injector and it becomes a vapor,
it automatically decarboxylates.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't, you no longer have,
because the cannabis plant doesn't make
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, it makes THC acid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really want to be able to detect the
compounds as they were in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what happens is when stuff gets
decarboxylated, a certain percentage of it
[SPEAKER_01]: like gets destroyed in the conversion
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, if you start with like a
hundred percent of THC acid or a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules of THC acid and say you lose 20%
of those molecules as it gets converted
[SPEAKER_01]: into THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get a report at the end that
shows 80 milligrams of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: THC or 80 units of THC, that's not what
was actually in the sample, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Our testing method has destroyed part of
the sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you go back and look at like all
the cannabinoid testing that's been done,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in the scientific literature,
60s, 70s, 80s, most of it was done on DC,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the numbers that we see are going to be
lower than really what was in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so call it like, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roughly after 2000, sometimes it might've
been like late nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: People started realizing, Hey,
no, we need to do this in what's called an
[SPEAKER_01]: HPLC or a high pressure liquid
chromatograph chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the liquid chromatograph doesn't do
that initial decarboxylation step,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because your sample, it gets, rather than
going into an injection port, your
[SPEAKER_01]: microliter of liquid sample that we use to
extract, you know, our extraction buffer
[SPEAKER_01]: from the plant, that gets injected into
like a stream of other liquid that runs
[SPEAKER_01]: through the machine at like 25,
27, 30 degrees, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe 40 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not decarboxylating anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the chemicals that are in that,
in the HPLC and the liquid chromatograph,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't change, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're getting if we use that
method is an accurate representation of
[SPEAKER_01]: what's in the sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a much better technique for
using for cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what they use now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all labs are the same, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of the way, here's the
thing is the regulations usually say,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to develop a test that will
accurately quantify cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that test must be what's called
validated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And validated just means like you run a
set of experiments using your protocol to
[SPEAKER_01]: show that your protocol is actually
measuring what you say it's measuring,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like calibrating your ruler.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like proving that your ruler is
calibrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not saying stuff 12 inches and
really it's like, you know, eight and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half inches or whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what validation is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the regulations say you have to
develop a validated method, but they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you, you have to use this exact
method with this machine and this column
[SPEAKER_01]: and this solvent and this extraction
buffer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what ends up happening is every lab
develops and you'll see if you go and ask
[SPEAKER_01]: them about their methods, a lot of them
will come back and say, well, that's
[SPEAKER_01]: proprietary.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't disclose to you the way we do
that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of a red flag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I'm in labs, you know,
like I'm not a one-off, like we do it
[SPEAKER_01]: in-house because it gets too expensive,
but to do it as a third party.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I am working with a third party
lab, we're not just running one or two
[SPEAKER_01]: tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're going to be running hundreds of
tests, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're essentially paying them to
generate data for us, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need to be sure that the test that
you guys are running actually measures
[SPEAKER_01]: what it says.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll go in to a lab and say,
show me all your validation documents.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't let you photocopy them,
take them with you, but you can certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: sit down in their office and read through
their methods.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've done this, like when I was
working at Napro, we did this with
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple different labs because Napro was
a research lab and we had dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: clients that were, so, you know,
growers that we represented would grow the
[SPEAKER_01]: samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would analyze the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd go off to the lab or they'd go off
to the dispensary, but the dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: would be using like one or two or three of
the biggest labs in California for the
[SPEAKER_01]: same samples, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had our data.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we knew was damn solid and we've
published the methods so anybody can go
[SPEAKER_01]: and check out why it's solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like we had real confidence in
that our results were right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we would, what would happen is because
our client would send off the same sample
[SPEAKER_01]: that we had data for to multiple labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would get back that are essentially
duplicate copies of the same results,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with somebody else's lab, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was generated by something else and
you'd see, oh, this lab can identify
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenaline or this lab is confusing CBD
and CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, those are pretty big deals,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, like 99.9% of the samples
they see are THC only.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't really matter whether that
tiny little blip is CBD or CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, again, like if we're saying
that this is a legal document that
[SPEAKER_01]: supports the regulations, that have been
created to protect cannabis, like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of an important thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, you'd think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in the in the gas chromatography,
when they do that kind of sample with the
[SPEAKER_04]: ethanol, is that little tiny one
milliliter that they are point,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever milliliters, is that homogeneous
enough when they pull it to be a great
[SPEAKER_04]: average of the sample that they're taking?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that how that works?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like that's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sampling of the one microliter out
of this thing, like you can you can
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine that like every step along that
process from taking the flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's actually goes back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it starts with the sampling
procedure.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you get the bud out of the bag
that it was grown in or out of the lot
[SPEAKER_01]: that it was grown in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so very often what happens is this is
like, listen, everybody found all sorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: ways to game the system because the
consumer is so THC driven.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is trying to work every single
sample angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, growers will go and cherry
pick all the biggest, nicest, beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: buds out of the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest buds are in the top of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have a lot of chemical
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you want a real number of the
batch, we developed a sampling method
[SPEAKER_01]: where, you know, you take one bud this big
and one bud this big and then one bud this
[SPEAKER_01]: big and they all get combined together or,
you know, so many grams of each.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole thing gets blended up and
homogenized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you use that homogenized sample
to do your extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't like if you're showing up at
SC Labs and you're trying to like you got
[SPEAKER_01]: a feed company, you're trying to sell a
million seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go and they chop off the top as nice
as big as buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They trim all the like the green leafy
parts off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's absolutely nothing but resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those pristine, beautiful baby
labs go off.
[SPEAKER_01]: The samples go off to the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get a fucking higher
number.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are the games that end up
getting played because the more THC you
[SPEAKER_01]: got in your sample, the better the
distributors and the retailers and
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody is, you know, anybody that's THC
focused, they're going to get bamboo from
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of stuff.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, like you said, there's there's
that's just sampling the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it goes to the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe the lab like getting paid a
decent fee and they like put like an
[SPEAKER_01]: extra, you know, point five or five
percent extra flower on the scale when
[SPEAKER_01]: they go to do the extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for like there's there's a million
ways between the plants and getting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that injection going into the
injection port ways to manipulate the
[SPEAKER_01]: sample.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget like intentionally manipulating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also like natural variation and
like experimental error that happens that
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to allow that is going to have
unallowed variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one thing we were talking about the
other day is that, like, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: in Canada, the regulation says that the
THC content in the flower must be whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: is labeled on the on the bag or the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's labeled for THC content that
has to be within plus or minus 15 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: of the actual amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so that's like if it's 20 percent
and it's actual 20 percent, 50 or 20 is
[SPEAKER_01]: three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means that like 23 to 17 or 17 to
23 is actually like that plus or minus 15
[SPEAKER_01]: percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the window on either side of 20.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like it's important for people to
understand that, like.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a loud error that's to be expected,
there's really no difference between 17
[SPEAKER_01]: percent and 23 percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, that would apply like between
30 and 24.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
Like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, as you go up, like,
yeah, 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you know, 50 percent of 30 is four
and a half percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got like 34 percent down to like
what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Twenty six, five and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Twenty five and a half.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like that's a huge fucking range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you get higher, it gets whiter.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And listen, that is cannabinoids are
typically regulated by regulation,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the regulator, whoever makes the
rules for the, you know, to set up a legal
[SPEAKER_01]: program says, hey, cannabinoid lab tests
have to be with plus or minus within plus
[SPEAKER_01]: or minus 15 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what that's going to be our
allowed range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your your assay that are that protocol
that your lab designs to generate this
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, it has to hit between these two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like for example, turps aren't
regulated in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turps are considered cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they're not.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cannabinoids are a specific class
that bind to the cannabinoid receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's arguably like only beta carry off
when it binds to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're they're a different chemical
class.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, you know, all of us,
all the producers and retailers,
[SPEAKER_01]: they want that terpene info on the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is somewhat informative to the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's another way that you can
differentiate products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, mine's different because this is the
chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, turpinoids or terpenes aren't
regulated in the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there is no requirement to analyze
and disclose the amount of terpene content
[SPEAKER_01]: on a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's purely an extra thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because they're not regulated
molecules, there's no fucking regulations
[SPEAKER_01]: that says, hey, it has to be within 15
percent allowable range limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Canada, and I'm sure I don't know
exactly what it is, it probably varies by
[SPEAKER_01]: district in the state, but at least in
Canada, because they're not regulated,
[SPEAKER_01]: labs set their own allowable acceptable
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I validated one labs method and I was
reading through their described allowable
[SPEAKER_01]: range is 30 percent plus or minus.
Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got like, let's call it like,
well, let's call it six percent turps.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A third is like two out of those six.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's essentially saying like,
you know, two percent on either side of
[SPEAKER_01]: six.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like from four to eight percent
range.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lab can't really differentiate between
the difference between those two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's a that's a huge bummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think people understand that
because, you know, when some of these labs
[SPEAKER_01]: publish the results, they're like,
oh, you have like three point four seven
[SPEAKER_01]: nine milligrams of three point five seven
nine percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's like, dude, if it's 30 percent
off, why the hell are we measuring it down
[SPEAKER_01]: to three decimals?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you just it's so dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you have to realize there's a
difference between accurately labeling
[SPEAKER_01]: labeling the information on a product
versus how can you stick information on a
[SPEAKER_01]: label of a product to sway a consumer's
buying preference.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And clearly those aren't the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of I think it's really well for
anybody watching and you're just basing
[SPEAKER_01]: things on numbers, you're getting fooled
like you're getting bamboozled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting you're having your
marketing emotions played with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is this is what companies do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So understanding that all in context,
maybe let's think about going back and
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at like a lab report.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for in the in the numbers that you
sent me, one of the things I found really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting was, you know, whenever I look
at a lab report, my first thing is I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: mean like everybody goes straight to TAC
or straight to terpene content or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, who who's the lab?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's the lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are these guys trustworthy or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have like a thousand lab reports
or two thousand lab reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start to say, hey, these guys always
have like, you know, like all of their
[SPEAKER_01]: results are like 33 to 38 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I find that same logic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or to seed companies, you know,
like I see them working with things like
[SPEAKER_04]: 40 different things that have been
non-existent for 40 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, OK, well, full of shit,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, too, like the other
thing you got to keep in mind,
[SPEAKER_01]: too, it's like when we see these huge THC
scores, like 30 plus percent THC acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a huge amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is like a fucking massive amount
for a plant to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one flower on one run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really what was set and sampled.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you follow that cultivar back through
five, 10 cycles, it feels like you'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: 28, 26.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one that always appears on the
seed bank package says it's 34 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like people got to realize that like
when you're being fed one of these
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers, especially if it doesn't come on
that certified.
[SPEAKER_04]: Letterhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legal document.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're signed at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you go down and look at it,
it's signed by the laboratory manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, again, that's part of this chain
of custody thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That happens with regulated shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check out the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, look before even looking at the
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was like, you know, I always want
to say before I can put any confidence in
[SPEAKER_01]: these numbers, I need to try and figure
out how those numbers were generated.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lab report should say
cannabinoids were were analyzed by HPLC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I get a laboratory back and it
says cannabinoids were analyzed by G.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, OK, well, the cannabinoid
numbers could be off by 30 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we've done those experiments and
you can burn up to 30 or 30 percent of the
[SPEAKER_01]: total cannabinoid content in an injection
port of the G.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inject like G.C.'s are not a great
instrument for measuring cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though all the analysis like up to
the mid 90s was done that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for terpenes, for example,
it's actually a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of very good labs,
what they'll do is they'll do and you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: do your, you know, put your body grind it
up, homogenize it, take your sample,
[SPEAKER_01]: put in your ethanol or methanol or
whatever your extraction buffer is,
[SPEAKER_01]: strip out the contents, separate out the
solid material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got your little liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With all your goodies in it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That often gets split into two different
samples or you will sample two different
[SPEAKER_01]: one microliter amounts from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One goes and gets injected into an HPLC
for cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: A separate one goes into an HPLC or sorry,
a G.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: for terpenes or terpenes.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually used to do two different
things when we sent the one off to the
[SPEAKER_01]: HPLC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would take your sample out and then we
would take one raw sample out of that sub
[SPEAKER_01]: sample and the other would get diluted by
a factor of 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have nine parts, nine microliters
of the solvent mixed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now what you do is you have a diluted
sample and a concentrated sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the concentrated sample is good for
all the very small components that exist,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, CBC, CBG, whatever the
little blip cannabinoids are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, you've got one that's like
really it's like being able to do it on
[SPEAKER_01]: those with a magnifying glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your diluted sample for the molecules that
are there in abundance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you try to often if you try to
cram those like THC, like a type one plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that's full of THC, you cram that through
your HPLC and it just it overloads the
[SPEAKER_01]: detector.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, all these places are
opportunity for error.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do them very, very carefully,
you can actually get incredibly,
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly accurate results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're like running a thousand,
two thousand samples a week that come into
[SPEAKER_01]: your commercial laboratory in California,
that's like throughput.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like you're you're essentially
breaking down how many can I do in a day?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, if I'm doing that many a day,
maybe I don't have the ability to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: quite as accurately.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are the decisions that get
made in the lab that no one's thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody just thinks you drop down your
120 bucks or 150 bucks and you get a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of numbers back and it's proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just toss it in the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just important for people to
understand the context.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you did you want to go over the
standard, what the standard is,
[SPEAKER_04]: how it works?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any machine has to be calibrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has the best way to explain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we take you got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got your bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get your bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call us our extraction buffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put a flower in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put in your ethanol and shake it
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sit at the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sit at the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just throw a sample all over the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sit at the flower and you got your
your your left over.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've got is ethanol or methanol,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're solvent with all the chemicals that
we were able to strip out of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got turf, got all the different
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: A standard like but we don't know how much
of everything is in that sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's an unknown amount of unknown
chemicals in this sample.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we need to do is compare it to a
known sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can actually order pure THC
from a lab synthesis company and these
[SPEAKER_01]: synthesis companies that are allowed to
have, you know, they get a DEA license so
[SPEAKER_01]: that like the cops can have and they'll
they'll sell the DEA license so they can
[SPEAKER_01]: synthesize THC and make what are what are
known as like a chemical standard,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is usually one milligram of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into one milliliter of methanol.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Methanol is an alcohol, but it's not like
ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's poisonous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you go blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea is people won't consume it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's so weird that anybody would like
consider the idea to go get THC standard
[SPEAKER_04]: ethanol and like fucking shoot it or
whatever they're doing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but this is what the context of the
DEA is thinking in progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, dude, really?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like even like a 20 percent bud
is like 200 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like really you're going to try to
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the theory behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one milligram in one milliliter of
ethanol is legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's legal for people can buy and trade it
without having licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you have your one milligram milliliter
you can essentially treat that like your
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction buffer extracted cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take like one microliter out of
that milliliter, inject it into your HPLC
[SPEAKER_01]: and you get a peak of unknown amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can say, OK, this peak is I know
that it's this known amount we're putting
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, now I can when I run another
sample and it has a peak of the same size,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that it had the equivalent amount
of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a way that you can calibrate your
machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And good labs will do what are called
check standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you run your calibration curve,
you get the machine all calibrated and
[SPEAKER_01]: then like call it every three or five or
maybe 10 runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather than running a sample, you run your
standard through the standard mix of
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene standards and cannabinoid
standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that should do is that like now
you have throughout your day, you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: your hundred samples that are going
through the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say every 10, you've got like a snapshot
of the machine in calibration.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's out, you can see, oh,
hey, we caught it while it was getting out
[SPEAKER_01]: of calibration was recalibrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an important it's for any analytical
endeavor where you're trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: like, hey, what's the exact amount of
compound in a plant or in a substance?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have the ability to compound
or to to validate that number,
[SPEAKER_01]: confirm that the amount that you're
measuring is actually what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: measuring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great question because like when
my friend Arno Haskamp is a Dutch research
[SPEAKER_01]: scientist that was involved in setting up
the Dutch system and he's a real plant
[SPEAKER_01]: nerd guy and he started doing all this
research and he wanted to check to see if
[SPEAKER_01]: the standards from the chemical company or
are what they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're supposed to be one
milligram per milliliter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he did a whole bunch of tests and
showed that the standard was actually 88
[SPEAKER_01]: or 0.88 milligrams per liter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the substance that the guys are selling
to all the labs wasn't properly
[SPEAKER_01]: calibrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everybody in the industry is off.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or everybody from those guys is off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is we're talking, you know,
I think this is like twenty two thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: and nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But two years ago in Canada, same thing
happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like somebody at F5 said, hey,
you know, the ResTech sample that was
[SPEAKER_01]: ResTech as a supplier for standards,
the ResTech samples that everybody uses to
[SPEAKER_01]: calibrate or that half the industry uses
to calibrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been wrong for eight months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they kept that by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes up in the circles, but it doesn't
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it does come up in your.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, when that happens, they have like
they're legally required.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you're the support industry for
a regulated system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's affecting everybody how they're
complying with the regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like they are right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does it does become known amongst
labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's the type of thing that
like the labs, they're not required in the
[SPEAKER_01]: public.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably should disclose to their
clients, but often they don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it can happen that they don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a chemical standard and you
buy a chemical study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, you're calibrating for
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I was just on the SC lab
website reading over some of their stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They they test for 39 terpenes and
terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they they they either have a standard
mix that a chemical supplier supplies or
[SPEAKER_01]: they buy individually all of those
individual terpenes and create their own
[SPEAKER_01]: standard mix that they use to to calibrate
the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not only calibrating for THC,
you're calibrating for Terps if you're on
[SPEAKER_04]: the test for every individual terpene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, some now they've gotten
to the point where like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they res pack or someone one of these
terpene or the supply chemical supply
[SPEAKER_01]: companies that services the medical
cannabis industry, they might say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, we've done the mix for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's 15 terpenes, you know, all the
majors or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pioneers, terpenoline, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll buy a pre mixed one of those so
that you don't have to individually go in
[SPEAKER_01]: and create the standard to put it to
calibrate your DC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, any time you're buying a
compound that you're not making and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not quantifying yourself is a potential
source of error.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's a bit of a deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we started looking at your
results, I started going through them,
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized whoever was generating those
results, for one, like, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was data pasted into an Excel
spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it wasn't even allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like one like route back,
like how much I'm not saying it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers were wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if somebody gave no, yeah,
my red flags would be like, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: something could be up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second thing I went through,
and I started looking at what's the ratio
[SPEAKER_01]: of THC in the plant versus THC acid in the
plant, as you probably know, cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't produce THC, it produces the form
THC acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so right, right, right away,
if you get a lab report back, and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a junk THC in there, like I'm talking more
than really a percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably been run through a GC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, okay, if the THC numbers are
coming out, like, you know, 20% THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: 25, whatever, that's yeah, you should see
25% THC acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't see 25% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just by that one number, you can see,
oh, they measure the whether or not they
[SPEAKER_01]: measure the cannabinoids through PLC or
through GC.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's through GC, the numbers probably
wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, we know that it's a bunch
of it gets destroyed in the injector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's things that you can like,
right off the top look at, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: most people are looking at the they grab
the lab report, they go straight to the
[SPEAKER_01]: THC number, and they're like, 32,
I'm the best.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, that's, you shouldn't be
doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at the context of what that
number means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is all the information in this lab report
consistent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And internally consistent, like between
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like between itself, does it make
sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was one of the things that
tweaked me a little bit when I first saw
[SPEAKER_01]: yours, it was like, they had clearly run
an HPLC and GC, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like I said, if you're using it
for the terms, the GC is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were probably looked like they
were collecting that cannabinoid data as
[SPEAKER_01]: they were doing the terpene run as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, you know, in my mind,
like looking at I'm like, ignore that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, don't even look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't even put any credence into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's just, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and with me, like, when I see
something off like that, and like,
[SPEAKER_04]: when it comes to terps and lab reports,
the reason I sent it to you, of course,
[SPEAKER_04]: when we talked, I was like, I don't know,
like, I have no clue, you can read this.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, yeah, I, I'm like anybody else,
you know, like, I see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, wow, THC number.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Terp numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's this mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody asked me about a year ago,
Ryan, when you start getting skeptical
[SPEAKER_01]: about a lab report, and I said,
when somebody says to me, I have a lab
[SPEAKER_01]: report for you to see, right, you should
already be skeptical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's not like you're trying to hate
on somebody's report card.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but you should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you have to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that is the mentality that you have
to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are these numbers that I'm looking at
really real?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Right.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, like, again, like, you know,
you hear I hear for a while in Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're calling them THC scores.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a fucking score.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't win a race.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an analysis of what's in the
flower that you grew.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, you played a role in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's mostly genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, any way, it's just funny,
like, you know, in this world that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: in, like, there's so much growers ego,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it's like, oh, yeah, you know,
and it's like, I really like, let's try to
[SPEAKER_01]: tease those two things apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how awesome you are from the weeds you
grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, four talent people that grow
great weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grow great flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm always impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care who it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, if you're truly producing the
finest, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, people like that, in my opinion,
help in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're just growing, like,
looking for lab reports, you can run
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world telling how real you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't impress me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I've seen enough lab reports that,
like, I don't, like, who cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, if you grow enough plants,
especially from seed, you're going to find
[SPEAKER_01]: some big ones.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big plants and big, big high numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, that's like a good thing to
look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, are you seeing neutral
cannabinoids or acidic cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or both, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be seeing both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want your neutrals, like THC,
CBD, CBG, you want those numbers to be
[SPEAKER_01]: really low.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's an indicator that your lab
report is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you sent me, like, for example,
so you sent me one, and one had,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I think there was like three and a
four percenter, terp-wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, those are, we had what we
call the schwag-schwag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really, like, under one percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would just discard anything that was
under one percent terp-wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're not, like, they're 80s
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that they're bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not the oiliest, dankest,
like, super drippy, oily weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we would just automatically,
meaning under, it doesn't even get
[SPEAKER_01]: considered for the, for, you know,
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we started, you know,
this was a few years ago, but we were,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, getting into the four or five
percent range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through breeding the highest
terpenoid-producing plants, we were able
[SPEAKER_01]: to get some, like, outliers that were up
to, like, even seven percent or even eight
[SPEAKER_01]: percent, which is, like, ridiculously
oily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, like, you really want to have
confidence in the lab that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a breeder, like a home breeder,
it gets really fucking expensive to use
[SPEAKER_01]: third party labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're growing 100 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that's like a $10,000 analytical
bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, in most cases, like, even if you
were to turn around and sell every gram of
[SPEAKER_01]: that crop, you're not getting,
like, you know, unless you're growing huge
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, you're not getting that 10 gram
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So doing that kind of breeding has to be
funded by people with buckets or somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: that has an understanding that,
hey, I'm going to make an investment in
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the result that comes out of the end,
is going to have value.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so nowadays, like, you'll see those
plants that are, like, up into the five
[SPEAKER_01]: percent, like, five percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say it's a maxima in the
market, but, like, when I see someone with
[SPEAKER_01]: a five percenter, even when I consider it
might be 30 percent inflated, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: wow, good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grew that well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I see oats, I'm really skeptical.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, they're not possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that they're possible because we've
made them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such an anomaly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got, like, six lines and all of them
are eight percenters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of like, oh, yeah,
you won, like, five billion dollar
[SPEAKER_01]: lotteries in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, the probability of that is really
fucking low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when the probability is really low,
something shifty is probably going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, this isn't about calling anybody out
or saying whatever your shit stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, somebody show the 38
percent labs flower, the 38 percent total
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is, like, exceptionally high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the lab report.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I called up Josh.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know Josh and Alec from their
two of the owners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called up Alec and I said, dude,
like, what's up with this number?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, people are showing this all over IG
and sending it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me what's going on with the sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, yeah, when we get a number
over, you know, I think it was 32 or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when they when they have a number that
hits a certain thing, it go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to the sample, start from the
beginning again and full process,
[SPEAKER_01]: reanalyze it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it a reprep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Run a reprep on that sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it came back, like, you know,
within the same small window.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was like, yeah, it's a real number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have these massive fucking
numbers where it's like all the stars
[SPEAKER_01]: aligned and the plants treated perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the most bang in genetic and the
dry and everything is done perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you preserve that beautiful specimen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you when you show me your samples
and you have that one that was higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all I can tell you is it seems high
doesn't mean it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's one to look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's anomalous and anomalous.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's two anomalies in those three
samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so so even if it was just based on the
numbers, I would be like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that doesn't mean that they're wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No lab report, no signature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even on a lab report.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know the lab never saw it
missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like all those things combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like red flag, red flag, red flag,
red flag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, you know, the only way to
really know these things is to run that
[SPEAKER_01]: sample that that plant to five different
grows and analyze it that that kind of see
[SPEAKER_01]: what's the range of what that plant does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess it could be an anomalous.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be an anomalous anomalously good
grow just that one round.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's that only time you'll ever see
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I think that we can still say
that, like, nobody really knows all the
[SPEAKER_01]: secret little switches and bells and
switches to give a plant to make it
[SPEAKER_01]: produce at its optimum optimum production
every single time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you hit it or you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes like there's a lot of clouds
or sometimes it's shitty weather and you
[SPEAKER_01]: get, you know, like whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, nothing goes perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The air conditioner goes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The kind of things that can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, in the context of like a thing I
like consumers to know is that like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just to understand that context is
because it's like, you know, like I'm in
[SPEAKER_01]: the market, you're out in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to provide good products from
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got some chump that's been growing
for like seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've got an Instagram page with
their crosses and like, everything's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I, you know, my results range
from like 32 to 40% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I want to have these
conversations in public is so that like,
[SPEAKER_01]: the consumers that are watching us,
they can become informed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they see the used car sales
and seed pushers, that like are everywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: in this fucking market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every left turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like every second account that follows me
is something genetics or something labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, Oh, you're a lab already.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got like a tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about trying to fucking make
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I like making a living out
of the cannabis would be nice for
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I really have taken this to
like a stupid level of passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In depthness.
[SPEAKER_01]: That it's like, when I have to stand
beside like Joe Blow, that's like spout
[SPEAKER_01]: nonsense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I just, you know, and I'm not
competing, not even competing for an
[SPEAKER_01]: audience, but it's like, Oh, I'm at a
conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm speaking on a panel besides some dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like spout nonsense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, Jesus Christ, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard when you love something that
much and you fit that many, that many
[SPEAKER_04]: years into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and just to watch you get bastardized
super fast around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way to do that is to like,
you know, it's to try to explain to people
[SPEAKER_01]: why your shit's different.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what you see, like all this time and
energy that I put into learning and
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding all this stuff, like why it
makes a difference in our, in our seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's, it's demoralizing,
demoralizing to have to, to sit there and
[SPEAKER_01]: do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, but the only way to really have
people recognize is to like educate all of
[SPEAKER_01]: our kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that people can be informed and people
can like not get caught in the carnival,
[SPEAKER_01]: get caught up with the carnival parkers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's abundant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, it's like trying to
walk across a field, like avoiding cow
[SPEAKER_01]: patties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a, there's a loose bunch of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what other stuff you want to
cover or what there's questions from the
[SPEAKER_01]: audience or stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone, someone asked our inaccurate
percentages fabricated by, by a false
[SPEAKER_04]: standards when using the GC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what do you mean a standard?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lab results can be falsified.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can also be, there are all the time
as we've explained with that 15% thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you didn't understand it,
see that go back and watch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is an inherent amount of normal
variation and acceptable laboratory error
[SPEAKER_01]: that influences the end results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when you put in the flower and you
get back that lab report, that didn't come
[SPEAKER_01]: from God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't believe in God, but that
didn't, somebody didn't hand that down to
[SPEAKER_01]: the divine and say, this is the divine
ultimate truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, Hey, we measured your shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the, this is the measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, what you should understand
is that that number is like, has an
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptable variation on the other side of
the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do people manipulate these laboratories?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: In every district there have been
laboratories that have had their bomb
[SPEAKER_01]: spank because like, it's like,
you take like, you know, there was
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody in a Leafley article,
somebody did this and laid out like a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand lab reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took all the statistical averages of
all these different labs and every lab's
[SPEAKER_01]: statistical average went on a,
on a graph with a different color curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see like everybody is all lined over
this one specific area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got one lab that's like
shifted to the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their whole curve is like shifted to the
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, okay, well, what the fuck
are these guys doing wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the truth is, and it happens in every
district higher lab results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get more sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore there's an incentive for labs to
give higher results because they're a
[SPEAKER_01]: profit for profit service.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a benefit for growers to seek
those labs out and maybe pay a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more for a higher number.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that's a bad design.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the answer, you can't go back to
that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do labs manipulate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not say all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: All labs would say a percentage of labs do
manipulate and that can be done
[SPEAKER_01]: intentionally or unintentionally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way it's set up is right for
corruption if, if one wants to be corrupt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's you have to, and again, it's about
this passion thing that we were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you seeking?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you seeking to market a product or are
you seeking the ultimate truth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you seeing the answers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, if you're not controlling that
agenda, you're getting played by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a consumer, unless,
you know, like say, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, you, I go through all this
stuff and you say to me, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, I really want to be like high
integrity seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do everything the right
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you show me what you're doing it the
right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have more faith in you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if like, I resonate with that
kind of thing and I say, Hey, Matt's doing
[SPEAKER_01]: all the things he's saying, look,
he's demonstrating that like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this lab report, but maybe it was a
little high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like something's questionable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shows that you got integrity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm a customer, I'm going to support
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are, again, that's like a value
judgment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that I value.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might not value those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as, and as you can see it,
like a lot of other people are like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, the jungle boys is the hottest shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go grab whatever they got.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't, the value system is not the
same.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, next question.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the education system is not the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like that, what we've been trying
to do with the whole breeder syndicate
[SPEAKER_04]: thing has been, it's been tough because we
decided a long time ago, the only way to
[SPEAKER_04]: combat disinformation and misinformation
is to educate, but you can't force people
[SPEAKER_04]: to want to educate themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you can do is lay it out for the
people that want to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been pushing this ball of pill
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: More people are getting to the point where
they want to know.
Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just, it's changing over time,
but it takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's like everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, what you and I
consider good music, that ain't what's on
[SPEAKER_01]: the top 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cannabis industry is going to be
no different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's going to be people that
really understand they're really
[SPEAKER_01]: passionate and they really want to have
some beautiful things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's like, the 90% that are
going to listen to Justin Bieber.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And smoke Bieber butt.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have some, I have some questions I
want to run through.
[SPEAKER_04]: It refers to testing, but it, it refers to
genetic testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you cool with that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of a, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know if there's an answer
to it necessarily, but do you know how far
[SPEAKER_04]: we are in mapping the cannabis genome as
far as are we able to tell real genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: relation as far as like S1 variation and,
and parental lines, father, cousin,
[SPEAKER_04]: sister, is that even something in cannabis
that you can do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't go and like seek that information
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the weird things with the
phylos, what phylos is going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they were doing the run around,
trying to get samples and they obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: approached me at one point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, not interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I will do is I said, Hey,
I've got all these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Self populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't I help?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we look at like 50 individuals
from the self population and then explore
[SPEAKER_01]: the variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then now we've got like, we've,
we've shown, Hey, here's like the parental
[SPEAKER_01]: clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the heterozygosity by sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grown a hundred offspring of the selves do
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seemed like that was the most like what
people went to phylos for was that
[SPEAKER_04]: information more so than any anything
else.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were just weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a pitch was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, collect your star on the
galaxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and it was like, it's kind of like
that whole like, we can show you your
[SPEAKER_01]: name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be up in lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's fucking nonsense, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People fall and fall for that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we, when I don't mean we,
but I mean, when humanity first did the
[SPEAKER_01]: human genome project, it was like,
Oh my God, we're going to know everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the whole genomes and that would
be able to treat disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you've got one white guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do you think that that encompasses
the genetic variation that exists in like
[SPEAKER_01]: the Jewish or the, or the African or the
African population or like the North
[SPEAKER_01]: African or like Asia versus, you know,
like wherever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the next evolution that came out of
that was called the thousand genomes
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, once you got a thousand
genomes, now you can start looking at all
[SPEAKER_01]: the different genes and seeing,
okay, here's kind of like a catalog of
[SPEAKER_01]: the, of the genomic variation that exists
in the species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like, at least it gives us a look at,
Hey, there's way more variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're not at the point with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are, you know, folks like
medicinal genomics and some other groups,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think medicinal genomics probably have
like, I would say, they've been doing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they've been doing it like more or
less the longest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, so they've started to get like,
yeah, you can go in and you're one of
[SPEAKER_01]: their clients and you've paid out your
fifth sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can compare, you know, your snips
versus other, essentially snips or genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: misspelling is in a word.
Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, and because these things are
repeated over time, if you have like a
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic misspelling that happens in skunk,
and then you cross it in the skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern Lights and skunk caves and skunk
Afghani, like you have a probability of
[SPEAKER_01]: finding that misspelling in all of those
different lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over time, you can use those to build
like a family tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we haven't really done a good job
of at this point yet is saying this small
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic change results in X.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we've got a bunch of DNA letters
and we can see a variation of these DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: letters, but it's like, okay, what does
that correlate to in a plant?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the hard work is correlating
the phenotypic data with the genetic data.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is going to take time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's got to be years away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's going to be, it's always going to
be an ongoing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with corn, they've done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a pretty good job of it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, listen, we've got like,
we've got what's called an annotated
[SPEAKER_01]: genome, which means you can look up,
Hey, you want to look up like the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, fatty acid desaturase gene that is
involved in like, you know, so plant
[SPEAKER_01]: cells, what happens when plants get really
cold, the oil content and the cell
[SPEAKER_01]: membranes, and there's a gene involved in
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, like I can look up that gene and
actually now go and find out exactly where
[SPEAKER_01]: it is in the campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they've said, Hey, this small
structure, the chromosome matches up with
[SPEAKER_01]: this gene and all of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the gene that does this in campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but, like, again, it's like,
you know, that gene, that segment is
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we know what every variant that exists
for that gene and the result of those
[SPEAKER_01]: variants are?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we don't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're, we're starting to build that
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one of the things, you know,
McKernan medicinal genomics, McKernan is
[SPEAKER_01]: no dummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looked up, he was like, Oh,
we're going to start looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid synthase genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's going to be one of the first
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, they sequence the whole
genome, but the first thing that they do,
[SPEAKER_01]: they take the microscope out, it's not a
microscope or a magnifying glass,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's an analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take the magnifying glass out and go
and you look at that region of the genome
[SPEAKER_01]: that has those genes involved in
cannabinoid production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, this one's got a break in the gene or
this one has two copies of the gene.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're starting to tease it apart
for like some of the major genes of
[SPEAKER_01]: interest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because they don't grow plants and
they don't do those correlational studies
[SPEAKER_01]: between genetic data and phenotypes,
they can't generate that kind of data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, it was, it was interesting going
back and forth with phylos at the very end
[SPEAKER_04]: before they shut their doors and giving
them known parents and the known children
[SPEAKER_04]: cuts and watching them come back and say
there was no relation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really interesting watching that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they, they put their, their whole
reputation on the line to do it on top of
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it makes you wonder what's going on
because I mean, you know, they are,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's like, didn't they fuck up the
sample?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they not just not writing them and
taking your money and telling you,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that could be, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have no way of knowing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have no way of knowing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and when we pointed it out,
they shut the doors.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I I'd like to see how long their data
stays up online, their data sets,
[SPEAKER_04]: because knowing that I would think that if
the more that gets out, the more likely
[SPEAKER_04]: people are to start asking questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I had like, listen, when they first
started coming up with their things,
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They offered me a job at one point in
time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I left Napro and came back to Canada,
they're like, well, come work for us Napro
[SPEAKER_01]: and just, or at the phylos and just give
us, give me like two of your CBG seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, you know, I legalization was
happening in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was over living out of fucking hotels
and escapes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, I didn't, I didn't value it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, I, there was too many red flags.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like the way that they were going
at collecting their data was wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because of, you know,
not who I am, but because of like the
[SPEAKER_01]: position I was in with knowing a lot of
people on the internet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having access to like, you know,
all the known stuff, I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: guys, like, I'll just get you all the
shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's verified cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, when you're doing a camp
tonic, that it came from the guy that read
[SPEAKER_01]: camp tonic, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and they were like, well,
we don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't want real legacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we got, it's like, well,
why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, you want to take people's
money to give them an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they were running a test and their
cost was 30, a hundred bucks or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're charging people hundreds of
dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, they're just turning them and
burn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the meantime, they're learning all
this stuff because they see everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: samples where it's like the guy that faced
the test.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only see your sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you understand your genetic data to
whatever degree you can say, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, there's my star on the galaxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like buying an anchor on the
moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can see with the telescope,
who cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like fucking useless.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but anyway, you know, anyway,
it's one of those things where it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you saw it to read Tom
Sawyer, but it's like, there's a point in
[SPEAKER_01]: time, I guess, to paint whitewash this
stupid fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Tom, can I give you my like apple if
you let me whitewash some of your fence?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what phylos was doing with
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody was lining up like suckers
to be, it all turned like, because of,
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that breeding work from Napro and
then there was the patent that came from
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of people all bent out of
shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, you're fucking phylos.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're working with phylos and patenting
all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you dumbasses fell into the fucking
phylos trap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actively paid to give away your
fucking information to some big genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're pissed off at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why the fuck are you mad at me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you fell into the trap, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know, the cannabis,
you know, community is funny with that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's like, yeah, like the patents,
everybody freaked out about the patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now everybody wants patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I think if you truly bred
something and you created something new
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can get intellectual property
protection by way of a patent,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a plant patent in the States,
fucking get on with your bad self.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's got to, now it's got to the point
of where you almost have to, if you want
[SPEAKER_04]: to stay competitive because the legal
market's coming and if you don't patent
[SPEAKER_04]: it, someone else will.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody can, somebody can't come along and
patent your shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can patent something that is the same
as your shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't get to it in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, really like what a patent is
saying, Hey, this, this is a unique thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that I developed as mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this gives you a stamp that says,
Hey, that you actually developed that
[SPEAKER_01]: because you have to demonstrate how you
made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you have to say to people I crossed
this and this and we did these selections
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's all things like the role
description.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have to have actual proof that you
crossed XYZ and the proof of all this like
[SPEAKER_04]: video?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, do you know how it works?
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to stand up in court, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they can be challenged at any
point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't do a good enough job,
like you might get it past the USPTO,
[SPEAKER_01]: you might get it past the patent examiner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, yeah, this thing appears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if somebody comes along and challenges
it later and they can demonstrate later
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that, Hey, you didn't document well
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's these things that call what
you said into question up in front of the
judge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's going to make a ruling on whether
you actually, the patent is valid.
[SPEAKER_01]: A patent is a claim, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean that you fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a claim that you own something,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you really own it is a matter for
the courts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like any patent can be challenged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're going to go through a
patent and all the effort and expense of
[SPEAKER_01]: getting a patent for something that you've
created, you should probably do a good job
[SPEAKER_01]: of describing every, like all your
homework.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every last step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you want to lay out the whole
story because the story is what gets
[SPEAKER_01]: published in the patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody comes along and says,
yeah, this doesn't make sense in your
[SPEAKER_01]: story, that's ground for a challenge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why when you see,
like, you know, I'm not talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: plant patents, but if you read some of
these patents on like genes, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, or for example, in a chemo
type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be like, we're patenting every
plant in terpenelein dominance with type
[SPEAKER_01]: three or type two, you know, cannabinoid
profile, meaning CBT and CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means everything from 1%,
2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll literally see that fucking list
out like, you know, one through 40%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For clarity that they say this patent
claims every plant that is 1%,
[SPEAKER_01]: 2%, 3%, 4%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, you document it as tightly
controlled as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea that patent attorneys do is
like, you want to write patents that are
[SPEAKER_01]: defensible in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you try to close every loophole that
you can think of.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And patents are different than trademarks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Archive runs trademarks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trademarks are something, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trademark is how you sell a product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, when we start talking about
intellectual property on plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever the person is watching this in
the world, like if you're in Europe or
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in Canada or you're in the United
States or you're in China, totally
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
Okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something in the, there's a system
that is like accepted all over the world
[SPEAKER_01]: called UPOB.
[SPEAKER_01]: And UPOB is essentially the union for the
protection of plant varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're the guys that created this
overarching system that said, these are
[SPEAKER_01]: the ways that we evaluate to see who owns
or develops a new plant variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's an international treaty made by
an international organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the countries come together,
most of the countries in the world come
[SPEAKER_01]: together and have signed this treaty.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, for example, you know,
call it like New Zealand, say they signed
[SPEAKER_01]: on in like the 1974 edition of the treaty
and the United States signed on in like a
[SPEAKER_01]: later version, call it 1991, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are made up numbers and dates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're only beholden to the version of the
treaty to which you signed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then when you sign the treaty,
all these, like, for example, they go
[SPEAKER_01]: home, you know, so there's this
international treaty, the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: signs on the international treaty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we're going to be part of this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they go back to the United States and
they write a set of legislation that backs
[SPEAKER_01]: up the treaty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that legislation is totally unique
to the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you follow the overarching principles
of the umbrella organization, that top
[SPEAKER_01]: level org, but really, every country is a
silo with their own system.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so patent, plant patents per se only
exist in the United States and Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is one such thing as a patent,
plant patent in Canada or Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use Breeders' Rights, the Breeders'
Rights system that's overseen by UPOC.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the major differences between those
two is that a patent, you don't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: disclose or make available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, when we talk about
international registration of plant
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties for plant cultivars,
what that does is, so I develop whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: call it like a blueberry sweet,
let's call it a blueberry sweet scone
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find a blueberry sweet scone plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally different.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I register it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I declare the parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do the whole spiel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he says, okay, Ryan, this plant is
yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recognize that you're the developer of
this plant, this one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You select it out of this population.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to give you a cultivar
registration recognition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a registered cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you get out of that is the rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get the plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like now that plant that I have,
that anybody that wants to grow that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere else in the world, they can grow
that plant, but I get the royalties or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like I have the rights to the
royalties or whatever profits come from
[SPEAKER_01]: the development section of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get to say is nobody else can use
this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, one of the conditions that you
have to do is make your plant available to
[SPEAKER_01]: other breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is, is like, Hey,
the reasoning from the top level org is,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we recognize that you develop that
plant and it's special and it's awesome
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to give you 17 years of
economic exclusivity around that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant genetic resources are not yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entire globe has the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody on the planet has the right to
that plant for use in the betterment of
[SPEAKER_01]: all plants for humanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore the plant that you have the
certification on, we recognize it as
[SPEAKER_01]: yours, but you have to share it with
everybody else.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of people can take my shit
and breed it and improve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have patent, I don't have to give it
out to anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can control who gets it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it truly is your piece of
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your, you have ownership over that
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a weird, like unique thing
that happens in the States because you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys have these patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're recognized in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not recognized anywhere else in
the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even Canada?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one form of patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other forms of patents,
like there's utility patents and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: all this other shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but I think, you know, rather than
doing a show on patents, it's just good to
[SPEAKER_01]: recognize that that's kind of the way it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, get it, get yourself a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also do cultivar and variety
registrations in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think with patents around, why would
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing about being part of the
international variety registration is that
[SPEAKER_01]: you, you don't only have rec, like for
you, if you're only growing in your
[SPEAKER_01]: clients, we're only in the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your patent in the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you're, you're protected in the
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that plant to Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody recognizes your IP.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you might want, if you're
going to be doing business
[SPEAKER_01]: internationally, you might want to get,
um, a form of intellectual property
[SPEAKER_01]: protection that is recognized
internationally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hear Kymira talk about Kytosan,
jasmonic acid and salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this something that you know a lot
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not like a plant physiologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have that stuff on the top of my,
on the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're, they're signaling
chemicals, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kytosan, Kytosan is not Kytosan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, that's the molecule that's in
the shells of crustaceans, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some evidence that it does
stuff in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not my area of specialty.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to talk to you about,
what is Kymira excited about genetically
[SPEAKER_04]: that's around right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Something you're working on or something
that maybe you, you saw recently that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're really stoked on that's novel?
[SPEAKER_01]: It might, listen, I get off on the
variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like new stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, I like, I like when our
understanding grows, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, because for me in genetics,
it's like, I, you know, we, we talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about it a little bit with, with Caleb on
the Shango show the other day,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, like when you're selfing a
plant, it's not just about looking through
[SPEAKER_01]: the population and saying, Hey,
oh, this plant's great because of whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to understand all the traits in the
plant and how they're inherited,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how it's breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like being able to take apart
a machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you can take it apart and put it back
together, then you can reassemble it in
[SPEAKER_01]: new ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's really what, you know,
like when, for example, the thiol story
[SPEAKER_01]: came out, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The scunk compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to now be able to go into a
breeding program, take a plant with
[SPEAKER_01]: thiols, self it and see how does the,
like what happens in the distribution of
[SPEAKER_01]: that thiol expression in the offspring?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you analyze that,
then you can kind of get to understand,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can develop a hypothesis about
how that trait is inherited.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you know how that trait is inherited,
then you can bring it into any other
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like kind of what I nerd on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not probably that exciting to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, yeah, that's the kind of
stuff that I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I don't really like,
there's, I have favorites, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when I look at cannabis,
I don't really look at it in that,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost call it like a prejudicial way
where we're segregating plants on quality
[SPEAKER_01]: and I only like one type.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've got my favorite dogs,
but for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the very, I see the inherent value
in all of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I'm in Morocco, when I was in
Morocco, I found these plants that are,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a, there's a hemp variety called
panorama.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially the plant grows like a
globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like all the branches are completely
equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes like this round bush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this hemp breeder named even Boschke
years ago, he developed a variety of it
[SPEAKER_01]: for, um, like as an ornamental variety,
it was like the only, it was at the time
[SPEAKER_01]: it was the only ornamental cannabis
variety that had been bred.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he thought, Oh yeah, people planted
their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, these little weird globe balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, anyway, I found a plant like that in
Morocco and I was like, fuck, you went to
[SPEAKER_01]: take some seeds out of that sucker and
take it home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's an oddity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an oddity.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not in the current cannabis,
massive gene pool, as far as what's being
[SPEAKER_04]: worked with.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never noticed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I like the different, like I really
do get off on the variation that you see
[SPEAKER_01]: in the species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because I don't think anybody's done a
very good job at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like characterizing the variation that
exists on any given set of trades,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We did, we started to do a pretty good job
on turps and on, and then once we,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we did turps at first and then
we were like, you know, you end up with a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that has the same terpene,
terpene profile and you got two plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that are identical or that look identical
by lab report, but you smell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, okay, this is clearly not the
whole story.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to look at other chemicals so that
you pull out the GCMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you start looking for regions between
your peaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, what else is in there that
we're like just driving over, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not seeing in the analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you start looking at that and
then you find, Oh, there's other scent
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules that are involved in other
molecules with scent that are involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: our perception, perception of smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, it's like, I've used this
analogy before, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of like going to the orchestra
and then, and then turn to the guy that's
[SPEAKER_01]: never heard orchestra music and saying,
Hey, you hear the oboe, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, he perceives that in the
overall sound of what he's perceiving is
[SPEAKER_01]: the sound of the orchestra, but he hasn't
trained himself to be able to like
[SPEAKER_01]: identify that one note, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And scent is an orchestra of molecules,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we smell those molecules,
we get them all at once that we perceive
[SPEAKER_01]: it as one thing, but really it's one
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's kind of like looking at
the Mona Lisa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you can say, yeah, it's one
painting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, it's one painting,
but it's like, look at all the intricacy
[SPEAKER_01]: that exists in it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: All the brush details.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really the difference between
that's what happens when you, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I did, I missed the thing last night,
but I imagine it's the kind of stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys were talking about last night,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went through his kit and I went through
and smelled each individual one,
[SPEAKER_04]: like the terpenes, they're all in
different percentages and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_04]: but yeah, it was fascinating.
[SPEAKER_04]: There, there were certain ones that I was
smelling like lemonade and a few others
[SPEAKER_04]: that I just, it totally wasn't what I
thought it would be like.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, there's a few different lemonings
in there, but yeah, it was, it was wild,
[SPEAKER_04]: man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, he, he, he wants to send you one of
the full kits too, if you ever want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll check it out for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, he, he wanted to know crybaby,
uh, I'm curious how soma clonal variants
[SPEAKER_04]: fit into the whole plant patents or whole
patent sphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soma clonal variants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soma clonal variation is like,
let's call it, it's usually referred to as
[SPEAKER_01]: the genetic variation that comes out of
tissue culture, but you can really,
[SPEAKER_01]: so a somatic cell is like any cell in your
body that is not destined to become like
[SPEAKER_01]: sperm or egg.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, audio cut for a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we dropped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arms are just going to keep going off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so soma clonal variation is like the
variation that exists as a result of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the somatic cell is like any cell
in your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was saying, it doesn't become a
germline cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't become again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to become a gamete.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: In plants, we talk about it from what we
see the variation that exists when plants
[SPEAKER_01]: come out of tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's a variant that we recognize
as a phenotypic variant, which we're
[SPEAKER_01]: noticing a change in morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, probably what's happened is the
hormones that we've been using in the
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue culture processes have caused a
genetic mutation that is the result of
[SPEAKER_01]: that variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I'm just trying to like
repurpose the question to say like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's the degree of natural variation
that exists in the cannabis plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a paper that was just done on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there was some flaws in the
paper, but they, they actually sequenced
[SPEAKER_01]: all these different plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they took samples from a big model
other plant called like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was like five or six feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually not in the healthiest
condition, which, you know, it was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, maybe that's, that should have
been documented in the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: But bottom line is they took a whole bunch
of genetic samples of different shoot
[SPEAKER_01]: tips, bottom of the plant, top of the
plant, medium, middle part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lo and behold, there's all these
genetic mutations that exist even with
[SPEAKER_01]: just a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget tissue culture, just within a
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, whether that is a factor of them
doing a bad analysis or not, let's forget
[SPEAKER_01]: that and just assume that it happens.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants and we've seen this in trees,
mutations happen as plants grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you got like a plant that throws
off two shoots, right, so this is the main
[SPEAKER_01]: down here, you get two shoots come out
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When this guy has a mutation, every cell
that develops from that cell with a
[SPEAKER_01]: mutation is going to carry that mutation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've literally got two branches on
a tree that are going off in different
[SPEAKER_01]: ways that have different genotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that genotype happens in a gene,
if that mutation happens in a gene that's
[SPEAKER_01]: important, in an important trait for
cannabis, that could lead to like a change
[SPEAKER_01]: in the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't know, you've probably heard
like someone's asking like a sport,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that is a sport.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a sport is like a shoot of the
mutation, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for example, I was just going to
mention like, maybe people have heard
[SPEAKER_01]: about like Pinot Noir is a grape variety
that's been around for hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have these new grapes that are
called Pinot Noir or Pinot Blanc,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means Pinot White and Pinot,
Pinot Gris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pinot Gris is actually kind of a pinky
grape, pinky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a sport that they found on
like, somebody was walking through a
[SPEAKER_01]: vineyard of Pinot Noir and noticed that
one branch on a plant had gray grapes,
[SPEAKER_01]: not purple grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there is a mutation that happened in
the color gene, right, and maybe some
[SPEAKER_01]: other genes as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point is you snip off that that
sport or that cutting, that plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually different enough from the
registered Pinot Noir variety that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually take Pinot, that new short,
the new sport, Pinot Gris or Pinot Blanc,
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe not patent it, but you can
register it for a variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patent is a little bit different because
of the way they analyze, the way they kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of characterize them is a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's like, you know,
when you do your plant registration,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, oh yeah, the grapes are purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you go back and you got this one,
the grapes aren't purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's obviously not the same variety,
right, or the same cultivar, so you can
[SPEAKER_01]: name it as a new cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, truth is, like these things
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They happen in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The degree to which they happen in
cannabis, I'm sure we know that it
[SPEAKER_01]: happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the degree to which we know that
it happens is probably still up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if that answers the
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe there's a little context for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you talk about, and now we're going to
some of your strains that you've done in
[SPEAKER_04]: the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you talk about my favorite strain?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we've probably gone over it before,
but since this is a new episode,
[SPEAKER_04]: mental floss.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that was one that touched me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a whore for purples.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was made during an era where
purples were pretty obscure at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the purple craze had gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not many people were breeding with
purples, but mental floss always had this
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful purple senescence during flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about it a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: When it turns at the end, it's a beautiful
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when it does one of those things,
I guess it's got a bunch of carotenoids in
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carotenoids, like when you look at,
for example, I don't know if you probably
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have maple trees down where you are,
but you might've seen them in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go from like green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when the green, the plant,
you know, when the plant's going into the
[SPEAKER_01]: fall and they're about to shed their
leaves, they pull.
[SPEAKER_01]: As much resources back out of the leaves
into the trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can save those building blocks for
next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's left.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens is the plants go,
the leaves go from green to either red or
[SPEAKER_01]: yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason they're red or yellow is
because they've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Molecules in the leaf called carotenoids
and carotenoids just comes from that
[SPEAKER_01]: yellow, orangey pigment color.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they're called that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like kind of like, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those carotenoids kind of hide behind
the.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with methyl floss, again,
when you, when you give it a good flush at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant, you know, cannibalizes all
that, that chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: You end up with these beautiful kind of
rainbow yellow and purple leaves in the
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant is also like, it makes some of
my favorite hash of any cannabis that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: ever come across.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super flavorful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It melts like fucking hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you, someone's saying fuck carrots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck carrots.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you, when you, it melts like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also very up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I would smoke that stuff thinking I'm
gonna have another puff and go to bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I got the computer two hours
later, type it away, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it just, it gets you going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it yields like a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, it's just a great plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did you source your stuff for the
incense haze?
[SPEAKER_01]: The incense haze, one of the parents is
sweet because the other one is a seed that
[SPEAKER_01]: came from this dude in New York state that
said he got out of the piff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it is or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I call it Frank's incense haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it really smelled like incense.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you grew it, like it was the reason I
paired that one with the sweet skunk is
[SPEAKER_01]: because the two, like very often,
not very often, not very often you'll come
[SPEAKER_01]: across two plants that are so close to
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sweet skunk and this plant were
like in almost every sense, identical to
[SPEAKER_01]: the part where like you'd walk into a
room, like when you've got, when you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have plants for like 10,
15 years in your room, you get to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: like a little idiosyncrasy with the leaves
and the way that like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that the leaves come off the main
frond or the serration pattern or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to know them like a parent can
identify twins, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like which one of the twin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, um, and these plants would get
confused, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That people would get them all the time
because they're so close together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, anyway, yeah, it was, so when those
two came together, so I didn't keep saying
[SPEAKER_01]: I was selfing the sweet skunk cause I
wanted to understand the inheritance
[SPEAKER_01]: pattern of some of the rare volatile that
are in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the self, although it's pure,
it's a little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a wider range of like,
cause it's expressing all the,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the, the hidden variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or those that self population.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I crossed those two sister plants
together, when I, when I do a,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, when I do cross using a reversal,
I'll always hit the plant to itself
[SPEAKER_01]: because usually you're trying to get that
pure line, but I also always while the
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen is flying, I will just make a bunch
of other crosses at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, when you're going down a
program, it's like, Oh, Hey, I lost a
[SPEAKER_01]: trade or this line doesn't have a trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I want you go back to the line with
the trait and you've already got the
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrid that's 50% within the line you're
working in.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some guy did, uh, but anyway,
so when you cross those two things
[SPEAKER_01]: together, the, the, the incense haze,
which was the simply irresistible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they came out much bigger and
better, um, and very consistent to type,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, um, so it kind of was the best
of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when people ask me, it's like,
you know, when they're, when they're
[SPEAKER_01]: sniffing around that thing, I always say,
Hey, get both of them, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: get the self for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got the pure stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little home, a little more
homozygous or a greater chance of being
[SPEAKER_01]: homozygous, but the hybrid that performs
the other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of like a grower's performance,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it really depends on what,
what the customer is looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to have time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like to take my time to do like a
proper consult with someone because I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be like, Hey, somebody grew this stuff,
the lemon floss.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, what do you,
what are you doing it for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what are you using it for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I don't want you to just buy the
seeds that you think you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to have the seeds that are
going to be the best for what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a strain that you can think of
that you have been looking for for many
[SPEAKER_04]: years or strain you'd like to encounter
from the past that you haven't?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, like it can be a straight
discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would, in terms of plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, are there rare phenotypes that I've
seen in the plastic that I know that I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: love to see again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, of course it's kind of one of
those things that it's like, if it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: by and passes without grabbing a copy and
then solving it, like it may be gone to
[SPEAKER_01]: the wind.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to recognize that it is,
but you know, you're always looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: those things in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I had a plant when I was
relatively young and it was called
[SPEAKER_01]: Leskootie Sweetie.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an island off of Texade of British
Columbia in the strait there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Leskootie and it's no power.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's essentially a hippie commune and you
know, they grow a lot of dope up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, this one, like it was before I
had ever, I'd never even heard of the
[SPEAKER_01]: island at that point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was quite young, living on the other
side of the country and a friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_01]: a friend of mine, that's what we think of
Breeder Steve, your questions are funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, this flower ended up back with me
and it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like incredibly electric,
super strong, really up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, other than the name
Leskootie Sweetie, I never knew anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to come across those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like the beautiful girl that you
dated in high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might not find another one like it,
so marry her while you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we need to get your genetics here in
the States.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I know there's a lot of people
who really want to grab chimeras stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anywhere available in the States
right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't sell them in the States,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, when I worked down there,
part of, you know, becoming a landed
[SPEAKER_01]: immigrant is to have your fingerprints
scanned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like me sending seeds into the
States ain't really a great idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's probably, probably not,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe someone can work on doing some
chimera genetics out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Retail is going to come up and get going
again, but they're a UK band.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you know, with them having done
Brexit, it's a, like, it's a bit of a shit
[SPEAKER_01]: show, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not this, it's not as easy to do the
business out of the UK laws, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: perfectly legal for us to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people that want to do that can,
you know, get contacted me and we can hook
[SPEAKER_01]: you up to the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, the way the laws are
and with that whole fingerprint and having
[SPEAKER_01]: worked for the man thing, it's like,
yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That always puts it big.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crybaby made a comment on your limoncello.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, I thought the limoncello was very
consistent and was an excellent breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know he's done some stuff with it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the, that's the sweet skin itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is pretty consistent smell wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little bit of variation I find
still in, like in morphology, you grow
[SPEAKER_01]: enough plants, of the flower morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's just what I meant from that
context.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the smoking, they're more or less,
they're more or less the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're very close.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're within that type.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I wouldn't lay down,
if I was going to grow an indoor set of
[SPEAKER_01]: table, I wouldn't lay down seed from those
because there's just, if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell the flower, there's a little,
for me, there's a little bit too much
[SPEAKER_01]: inconsistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, is there anything else you want to
cover before we rock it out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve's saying, have some BC locals up
with seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these new eugenics need suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's seeds that are available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody, listen, everybody's,
you know what it's like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's known for the Cali stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Cali, Cali world owns the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, you know, Spain owned the world 10
years ago, BC owned the world 10 years
[SPEAKER_01]: before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll vary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll move around.
[SPEAKER_01]: The work, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing the work down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people that are growing
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And listen, that's the only way that we're
going to come up with new, better
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep growing seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just fucking keep growing seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: As much as it's appealing and you have to
grow clones for your business model,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just keep those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if you don't grow seeds,
we're never going to find anything new.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're always going to be stuck with
the same shit that we had five years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it goes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And listen, sometimes the stuff from my,
you know, it's like, I see, I say,
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it cannabis fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I like to, I like to hold on to
old tuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's like, they go out of favor,
but you bring them back like five,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years later and people are like,
I love that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, dude, it's the mini
skirt or the bell bottoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they keep it back, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I never thought I'd see skunk one make
a comeback.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it did, you know, a few years ago,
like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody asked me to sit in and help use
genetics to help referees and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's like, he got like five guys in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, I've got the original
skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, you do, do you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you don't have the original.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's that whole ego thing that like
people want to get together and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and be like, Hey, I got the
original.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an interesting plant, but it's one of
those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, it was one of the first,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The first, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dave started selling in Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every seed company was like,
well, the skunk's selling, we got to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: the skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, then Dutch passions got it
and Sensei's got a copy of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everybody's got a copy of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every fucking seed bank in the world,
more or less has a copy of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they all original?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much are they any like, you know,
it'd be really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: To have like an acre and have all of them
grow them all side by side and just see
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're like.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably like not even,
you know, they're probably not even a
[SPEAKER_01]: lake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm sure they're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this dude that bought the seeds back
in like, you know, 96 or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: when he got them, you probably didn't get
them from the original guy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your stuff original?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's a funny, it's a funny
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I was actually quite amused to see
one of the most spread around seed
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties that has existed in the last 50
years, have a bunch of new people pop up
[SPEAKER_01]: and be like, yo, I've got the original.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then throw down big dollars,
even though it's never been gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always been available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what like, what is the original?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the original was a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a named population.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like, you know, it's not like
today it's like, oh gee, Kush or cookies
[SPEAKER_01]: or fucking runs or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like these start as cuttings, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It always makes me laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, for example,
blue dream and blue dream came around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was one cut, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: More or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there ended up being a couple that
were very similar, but there was one cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people would come on and be like,
I got this blue dream Santa Cruz blue
[SPEAKER_01]: dream thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll like spank white widow on
it or some OG or whatever, some random
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they sell the seeds as blue
dream, blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now people grow those seeds in a different
market where they don't know what the
[SPEAKER_01]: original blue dream is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pick a mom, they say it's blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you've got two plants that are
being passed around the world as if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're both the original.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them is not even the same
chemical profile as the blue dream.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most likely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, cry babies asking how much of the
ancestral skunk can we get to see a fair
[SPEAKER_01]: amount?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we grow a chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's some stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ancestral people, I don't know if
people know about the ancestral skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were seeds that Dave, when Dave was
moving over to Holland, uh, in like early
[SPEAKER_01]: eighties, he brought obviously a bunch of
stuff over.
[SPEAKER_01]: He brought like a suitcase of seeds over
and, you know, did various things with
[SPEAKER_01]: them and didn't work with them in various
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: He met a hemp researcher that knew,
um, he met a hemp researcher that was
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially like, he was, he was in a
European country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say which one,
but he was the, he grew, like he was known
[SPEAKER_01]: as the hemp guy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like red hemp, their, their country sold
hemp seed around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when, when the police would like,
they'd come across a cannabis bust,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd go and get him and bring him to the
site and be like, is this drug cannabis or
[SPEAKER_01]: not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know black black.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, um, sorry, someone's asking that
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, anyway, Sam arranged for this guy
to grow on his research field,
[SPEAKER_01]: a Hector of skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and open populated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially like, you know,
Sam brought those seeds over and they all
[SPEAKER_01]: went in the greenhouse and said,
I did various things, things with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a big bunch of the skunk left
enough to plant like a Hector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they took them to this European
company country and planted in Hector in
[SPEAKER_01]: isolation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he and Rob went through the field and
robed all the males and the off types and
[SPEAKER_01]: the, and the, the females that were not
skunk like, but the rest of it just got
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking open populated.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what the ancestral skunk is.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, it's the closest thing a
population could be to what was produced
[SPEAKER_01]: in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the other families that came out of
that population were like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were family lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody went in and found two plants and
they crossed them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what came out of that from those one to
one cross is not the same as what was
[SPEAKER_01]: preserved in the overall open population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what the, that's what the skunk
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, Sam was like, there's all these
people are, you know, crying and whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: about having access to what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plastogram let's give them access to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, and they have, they got a little
germination rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they germinate like that,
like 25% or maybe even a little less now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't tested them recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're pretty old, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they must've been reproduced like
30, 25, 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of years ago, Sam was looking at
selling his collection and I actually
[SPEAKER_01]: helped him recatalog the entire thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we got to go, you know,
we went through everything and we did a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole bunch of germination tasks and we
pulled stuff out that was like 25 year old
[SPEAKER_01]: seed that had been stored at like,
you know, four degrees Celsius for 20 plus
[SPEAKER_01]: years, 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them germinated at like 80,
90%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So seeds, if they're stored properly and
consistently, they can last a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, I got, I got, I got a ton
of those blueberry seeds still left from,
[SPEAKER_01]: from the DDA projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are like, yeah, they're old
seeds, but dude, I can pull fucking the
[SPEAKER_01]: grapefruit sweet skunk out and pop 10 of
them and all 10 of them germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it doesn't matter how old the fucking
seed is if it germinates.
Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why, obviously some people think
differently, but.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there any skunk too in that population
of stuff that he had saved?
[SPEAKER_04]: Skunk too wasn't from Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he never, where's that from?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody else came along and made it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think he ever produced one called
skunk too.
[SPEAKER_04]: He, I remember there was some kind of
quote somewhere about him talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: how skunk too was the, the skunkier
version.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't work the skunkier version.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder where I read that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to go back and look.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff that gets
attributed to Sam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's like, again, all the things
about him in the new BA, like all this
[SPEAKER_01]: shit is attributed to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not even true.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's little specks of like roots of
truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody took and blew up into this big
weird story and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: misinterpreted this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cause he's Mr. Mystery.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, like he's an enigma.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't help.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, like, I think after,
like, I think if you were treated the way
[SPEAKER_01]: that he's been treated in the cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I mean, it's like the same thing
that happened with me and the,
[SPEAKER_01]: my branding for that work that ended up
being patented.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, everybody fucking turns on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, people, like I said,
everywhere, everywhere he went,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was like the, you know, the whole Dutch
scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that people started calling him
DDA was that he was able to come into a
[SPEAKER_01]: country that wasn't his.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not fucking Dutch.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went to Holland and as an American
expat and was able, was able to get,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, I didn't say rooting hormone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said hormones for plant tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rooting hormones, not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the shit that they use for plant
tissue culture can cause mutations,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, Sam was able to go into
Holland, set up a business, get a license
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow cannabis from the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody else could do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so of course all the Dutch dudes were
fucking choked, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, how is this not,
this isn't fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy's got all this shit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You must have some context that we don't
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the DDA is an American organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why the hell would the DDA go to the
government of a different country and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you gotta let this American grow weed
in your country.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't make any fucking sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's a stupid fucking assumption,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But like that's the story that some Dutch
reporter guy came up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he used to have a written cannabis
radio show and he spouted them all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the airwaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's fucking true for half the
world, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that where it came from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that where all this started?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it started as a rumor, but that's
when it like got popularized.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember meeting Scott at one point in
time, Shanti Baba, and he was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, Dave Watson, blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, dude, you've been fucking
fed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been fucked to lies by fucking
Neville and all these other guys that were
[SPEAKER_01]: jealous and haters, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Neville told me directly that he
knew Sam's DEA handler.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody knew his handler.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not fucking know what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just spent the nonsense and you came
in late.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm just going to ignore your
fucking questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, like whatever, dude,
like, yeah, he just told it as fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, people want to fucking question
you without even knowing like an iota of
[SPEAKER_01]: the fucking truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: But didn't you know it was going to your
partner?
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was fucking making medicine for
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dumb ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what my intentions were.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fucking company that I was working
with at the time that I was employed by
[SPEAKER_01]: that were allowing me to fucking like,
have my dream cannabis job and build a
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking multimillion dollar laboratory to
play in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, it's a job, but it's also a
job that I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the consequences that these guys
came out and patented a bunch of,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, a class of plants that didn't
exist before I made them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like how the hell people like you
can complain is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you, you obviously have no idea what
you're talking about and are spouting an
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion of what like from a place of
complete ignorance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, yeah, I do have to laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I'm emotional about it and
I'm clearly irritated is because I fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: got death threats from people like you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went after you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went after you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have the full, I didn't have the
full picture and no one did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, that's the problem,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no one had the full picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just went off of, uh, oh my God patent.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy's fucking with the man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And listen, our community was bred to
believe that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I knew research scientists that
worked at GW pharmaceuticals, like doing
[SPEAKER_01]: Petri dish work and experiments design.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like these guys would have the same
experiences that you and I would have
[SPEAKER_01]: taken care of Mary's nephew with epilepsy
down the street, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They would have personal relationships
with like these kids that couldn't get
[SPEAKER_01]: access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would come in and because of GW
pharmaceuticals that was doing the work
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis, they were allowed,
they were able to get access to the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines they needed to change their
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like big pharma or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't fucking have, I don't have a
problem with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're helping people in like a
context, again, they're operating in a
[SPEAKER_01]: context of prohibition where like these
medicines can't get to the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a post today about Marinol,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's chirping me about Marinol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Oh no, it's made by in a laboratory,
dude, a molecule as a molecule is a
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're fucking starving for water,
you don't care whether that water was made
[SPEAKER_01]: from like burning fossil fuels or mixing
hydrogen and oxygen in a laboratory or
[SPEAKER_01]: purifying it out of fucking shit sewer
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like once it comes out at the end and it's
pure fucking water, it's water,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the same with THC and it's the
same with CBD, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if those medicines can go to someone
that can benefit from those medicines that
[SPEAKER_01]: they couldn't access otherwise,
why the hell do you have a problem with
[SPEAKER_01]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that it comes from a place
where it's like, you feel like all the
[SPEAKER_01]: government's not letting you, you,
you do your art and grow the crop that you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what the result is dude,
don't change the laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like we've been fighting for that hard
for fucking 30, 40 plus years,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been involved for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I founded a political party in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a founding member of the,
the, the federal marijuana party in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like to effectuate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, I get that you're pissed off
and you're scared of big pharma,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you have to fucking direct that anger
in a channel that's going to change
[SPEAKER_01]: things, not just sit there and bitch about
big business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's boring, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's boring.
[SPEAKER_04]: And big business is going to happen
whether we like it or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're seeing that in the cannabis world
regardless.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to change cannabis in the few years
that I have left on this fucking floating
[SPEAKER_01]: rock.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think I'm not going to take a
job where someone pays me a decent salary
[SPEAKER_01]: and gives me like a multimillion dollar
budget to fucking grow and make class that
[SPEAKER_01]: the world has never seen before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't like it too fucking bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like seeing the passionate side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, I can, I mean, I get offended by
it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's like, you have people that
don't know what the hell they're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, they're spouting that off
as if their ignorant perspective is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: like one valuable, but like two supremely
valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they think that they're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, dude, go look up the Dunning
Kruger effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a little bit, you know,
a little bit and think that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Try learning a lot and then think that,
you know, you know, anyway, whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: there's too much of that in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I'm, I'm all up for raising
everybody up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to, and that's why we do
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we share perspective and we teach
people because we want you all to be
[SPEAKER_01]: better so that you all can go and raise
the fucking game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we all raise the game,
the cannabis is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: The products are better and the products
are safer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're all dabbing out on the dankest
fucking shit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's what exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I, I, I, I find it a,
uh, an honor when anybody, anybody uses my
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff because it means that it was good
enough in their eyes to take forward and
[SPEAKER_04]: make better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and the resulting factor that is if
they make something better than I made,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't let that intimidate me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to go work with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They truly are making it better,
but the thing I don't like is when people
[SPEAKER_01]: like they actually hack apart your work
and then they tell everybody it's better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they sell it as whatever your
strain is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's that I didn't give today
contact and he's like, Hey man,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want like, uh, I'm interested in this
kind of high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking at your Highland Mexican
Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I want to buy a hundred
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, Oh, you want to buy a
hundred seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not excited because he's buying a
hundred seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, it's like, dude,
if you're going to put in a hundred grow
[SPEAKER_01]: effort or a hundred seed effort into
improving the line, let me help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, I would guide this line and
I would, you know, and I'm going to throw
[SPEAKER_01]: in this line extra so that you've got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that as you're in breeding this one,
you should put a little bit of this back
[SPEAKER_01]: into it so that, you know, you don't,
you don't suffer re-inbreeding depression
[SPEAKER_01]: and they've got the same traits and it's
got some nice flavor stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, in the end you'll be,
you'll be able to build better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a five pack and then knocking off open
pollination of five seeds to me is an
[SPEAKER_01]: insult because it's like, you're not,
I went to a lot of work to create that
[SPEAKER_01]: population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you've essentially put it through
a bottleneck and you're selling it the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please do take my shit, make better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you make better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will support you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take my shit and you fucking knock it
into crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm not going to be happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's how I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I look at them like my kids,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you, you want your babies to go
off to good homes and have happy marriages
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I totally agree on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell us a little bit about the
Highland Mexican too, since we just popped
[SPEAKER_01]: it up?
[SPEAKER_01]: These were old seeds that came to me
through Radit Legends, actually someone
[SPEAKER_01]: shipped them to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was some old dude that was like,
yeah, I I'm old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been growing for years and years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I collected these things in the sixties
and seventies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, you know, I don't know
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't, I don't have the ability
to do something with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you please give them something that
did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we got from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew a whole bunch and found a really
interesting plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put, I had one, I was like,
I'm going to take this one plant and put
[SPEAKER_01]: it in the flowering room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, you know, it was like a real
equatorial, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, you put it in and it gets to
like a foot tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, Ooh, this thing is going
to really stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you cut it down and make four shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, this thing, it was like twice as
tall and wide as any other plant in the
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it must have produced like,
I don't know, it wasn't the, they were in
[SPEAKER_01]: like the many thousands of fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was like, you know, probably
eight, 10, because the whole thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like the whole, it was these long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the old kind of like long spear
flowers that you'd see in this thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: not too thick, but like really long
running.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like that just chopped full of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had a nice high effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, we were analyzing turps back
then, but I remember, I would say that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's probably like a limonene turpentine
or limonene pining plant, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: rare in today's terrapin profile world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what was really associated
with the limonene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just nice, but it was nice classic
non, like it was not popular, but so when
[SPEAKER_01]: I released those DJ joint projects,
I put some of those out there and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: think we sold a pack for like 18 months
because they were like, Oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: every one of the grapefruit, blueberry and
the mental floss and all the, the parts
[SPEAKER_01]: that were like getting yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally somebody decided to grow
a couple of those like in an, in an
[SPEAKER_01]: equatorial climate and ordered some of
those and grew them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were just, I mean, they're,
they have the ugliest phenotype flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like long spindly weird, like,
you know, like buds that have like,
[SPEAKER_01]: they look like they've got like five or
six foxtails coming out of just two
[SPEAKER_01]: calories stacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd look, it would look like a
finger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't look like a hand with a bunch
of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember seeing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take them, like just rip off the
calyx and essentially fold the paper
[SPEAKER_01]: around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were, it was a great,
nice effect in doing those crosses and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually in growing DJ stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I don't, I'm not, I don't have proof
that this is the way it is, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely my very strong feeling is that
all those introspective and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say up, but like cerebral
kind of highs that you get from THC and
[SPEAKER_01]: this is largely from running all DJ stuff
through that really expensive lab that we
[SPEAKER_01]: built like in population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of it's in the eight to 12% range.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not fucking 25% side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low cannabinoid production or what we
would call today low cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: production plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you whack up 30% to like 28,
25, 28, 30% THC, you start to really get
[SPEAKER_01]: that stone kind of lethargic kind of dull
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like all the sheen has been taken off
of like a high and you just kind of feel
[SPEAKER_01]: it in your head and you're just like kind
of whacked in stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you take a Marinal pill,
you actually feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of feels like somebody thudded you
in the head with something, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like whack.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't get that from those 12
percenters or those 10 percenters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of get a nice floaty buzz,
but it's like, it's enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you're affected, but you're just kind
of in a different headspace.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I clear headed high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and for, you know, like the folks in
Rob's generation, Dave's generation,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's I'm not saying Rob and Dave in
particular, but like people of that age,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what cannabis was when they were
growing up and what they had access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was where he didn't come across like
a cookie back in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, of course not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd be, you'd be buzzed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a different headspace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that whole generation, not that
whole generation, but the majority of that
[SPEAKER_01]: generation fell in love with that
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica and 20 plus percent cannabis came
along.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was too much for them because it didn't
do that same thing that they wanted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, when someone was talking
about when the baskets full stuff with
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, you're kind of right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like, you know, DJ, for example,
like with LSD, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe the baskets not full with,
you don't want to fill the basket with THC
[SPEAKER_01]: because when you're putting LSD and THC in
it together in moderate amounts,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's a more pleasant effect,
at least for him, for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all about perception.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, you know, it's an
interesting thing because essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: what's happened now is that like the
market with a 10% or a 12% flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good fucking luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The market consumers, retailers,
distributors are all going to laugh at
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arguably.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole class of people out there
that would like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like saying, Hey,
we're going to have liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're only going to sell things that are
like 25 and above percent alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get through them all beer, all wine,
all, you know, like coolers and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge amount of like alcohol
consumers or the people that like those
[SPEAKER_01]: products that they don't want to sit down
with a bottle of whiskey and like do shots
[SPEAKER_01]: or chugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a way we're doing the market of the
service and we're doing consumers of the
[SPEAKER_01]: service.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Vessel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't, you know, 20 people would go
to 10%, 12% bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy likes 12% bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a pussy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Hey man, like not everybody's like
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, some people want to drink
light beer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like getting baked stoned at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to be able to, if I have to react
to something, I want to be able to react
[SPEAKER_04]: as fast as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: At any point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when people are saying it's like,
you know, not everybody wants that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people don't want older weed,
older people usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's true, but maybe like,
you know, we could teach people how to use
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in a way that some people might
not want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even if you're a teenager,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And dude, I've seen it with friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've seen them friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they start smoking a little bit of
weed and then they're like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they get into it and they start
smoking more and they're fucking wasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't like it impacts their life
in a negative way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and so I want more people using
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they got to smoke something that's
like, you know, half CBD and half THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: or even just most of the CBD with a little
bit of THC in it, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 5% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think that we should make cannabis
for all people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a good thing for consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there, there are scientific
studies that show like mass consumption of
[SPEAKER_01]: THC for at least some people is not a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what do we say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry, you guys, you don't get to
just, you just, you're not allowed to
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit from this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, hey, how about I can make
you something that does that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, not a variety that I developed
out of Napro for the, with the beta
[SPEAKER_01]: terrarium in the CBDV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, I was like, that plant had no
recreational potential at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was no fun for anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was going to make a difference in
some three year olds life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his mom is not going to be able to
like give him this shit and he's not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have like 10 seasons a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That felt really fucking good,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being able to make that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It felt really, really, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can't tell you the way I can
imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was more proud of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a way than any high THC plant that I've
ever made that like has like a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: more people using it or like 10,000 people
smoking it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm all about making all types of
cannabis for all types of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because it's the one that like
the majority of people doesn't like,
[SPEAKER_01]: that doesn't mean that it's not an amazing
thing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got to, we got to make those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is what somebody was saying about
like, Oh, go up and work for this company,
[SPEAKER_01]: big bad company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to help fucking rich people
get richer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to fucking make medicines for
patients or provide plants for patients to
[SPEAKER_01]: change people's lives.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You either get it or you don't.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's going to, you know,
you're going to, people are going to look
[SPEAKER_01]: at what I'm saying from another
perspective and say, maybe it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever, all I can tell you is my
truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I just want to thank you because,
you know, you guys like you, red DJ,
[SPEAKER_04]: are all major, major factors in,
in, in the path of my career as a seed
[SPEAKER_04]: maker and the few readings I've done,
you know, so thank you guys for,
[SPEAKER_04]: for establishing that, that path,
you know, before me to try to,
[SPEAKER_04]: try to push the boundaries with blueberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and I still love your guys' stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still holds its own to today,
even with all the stuff around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I could give a fuck about the
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, especially right now, I mean,
the seed markets crashed, cannabis markets
[SPEAKER_04]: crashed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like right now, the people that are going
to stick through it or the people that
[SPEAKER_04]: were always going to stick through it,
whether they were making money or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm looking forward to that,
at least shaking out some of the fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's about all the good that's going
to come from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I got to leave you with something
that Dave said, you know, Dave Watson,
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam says, it's like, we all stand on our
shoulders in giants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of us, everybody that works with
cannabis, we all got those seeds from
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to respect the people that we got
things from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, all, all of us in our germ
pleasant that we have in our hands,
[SPEAKER_01]: it all came from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe we were refined a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we found some better plants and we
propagated and changed around,
[SPEAKER_01]: but all of us are beholden to the people
that came before us.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I want to thank you for stopping by.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for eliminating us on the
testing stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I learned a lot myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I, that is something I've been very
ignorant in is when it comes to testing
[SPEAKER_04]: and lab testing and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really appreciate your time and thank
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't wait to have you back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And listen, if there's more questions that
we didn't answer about lab testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: hit up Matt or hit up myself and we'll
address it on IG or we'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or yeah, we'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Push it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is there anything you want to,
you want to say before we go, like as far
[SPEAKER_04]: as where to get your seeds for people like
me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Canada, anything like that breeders
retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, unfortunately even Canada is a shit
show for seeds because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So breeder's retail, if you want our
seeds, reach out to me and I'll hook you
[SPEAKER_01]: up with the breeder's retail boys and
we'll get you taken care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, keep growing seeds, support
people like Matt support the real ones in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we, we got to eat too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, it's not like I'm choosing
new leather for the Lamborghini,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and even like really like the
seed industry is not what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody in the seed business is,
is hurting in a way that I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: people really understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so definitely support those dudes that
