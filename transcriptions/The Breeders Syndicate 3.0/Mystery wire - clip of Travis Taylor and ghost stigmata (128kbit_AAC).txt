[SPEAKER_00]: You've had things happen on the ranch that
are creepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, inexplicable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call it paranormal, but it's happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, very real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, one, it's almost like what
you would call stigmata that happened to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a rabbi out to a ritual that was
supposed to summon an opening to heaven,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are like a portal is what you would
describe it as, down at Homestead,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we did, the ritual, a thermal
vortex appeared in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: Homestead, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got that on FLIR data, and it was
repeatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We played an audio recording of the chant
back, and it happened again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when the rabbi was there that night,
he told me off camera, he came to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: he said, Travis, they said they're gonna
come to you tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, well, they said they're gonna
come see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, who's they?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rabbi said, well, whoever it is
that's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought he was messing with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's messing with me, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that night, I had a dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in my trailer, my trailer doors are
locked and everything, and I had a sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a waking dream that the trailer door
opened, and my bedroom door slid open,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a native walked into my bedroom,
a really old native, and he looked at me,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he shook his head, and he reached out,
and he touched me on the face right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and then he shook his head,
and he walked away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I woke up startled, and I went to the
bathroom, you know, there's glass of water
[SPEAKER_00]: on my face, kind of get my bearings,
and when I looked in the mirror,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was bleeding from that spot,
and I had a sore appear there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and stayed there for several days,
and that was bizarre to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you could probably explain the
way a bug bit me or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was swatting myself, but it didn't look
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like, just like somebody really
pressed me really hard right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
