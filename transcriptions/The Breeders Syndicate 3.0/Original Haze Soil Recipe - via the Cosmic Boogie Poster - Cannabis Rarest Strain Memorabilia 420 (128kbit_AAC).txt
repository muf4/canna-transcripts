[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, CineKit crowd?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have the original Haze poster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to keep myself out of reflection,
but this is behind archival glass,
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed, and it's a reason I haven't made
reproduction posters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna cost a lot to get it yanked out
of this, scanned, and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my reflection is gonna be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it there, but you're gonna
have to see the shape of my ugly head
[SPEAKER_00]: behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have here is the original Haze
Cosmic Boogie poster.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was sourced by Granddaddy Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this was given out at the
Hempfest 2013 as an award, and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased it from someone who won the
contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike owns the lion's share of these
posters, and for a while he was selling
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductions, no longer is.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that page for the reproductions,
he broke down what some of the meanings
[SPEAKER_00]: were behind some of this stuff,
or at least gave some insight to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I found some of it illuminating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna go through, even though I've
done a video on the Cosmic Boogie poster
[SPEAKER_00]: before, I'm gonna go through and kind of
highlight some of this stuff because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the rarest items in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if I remember correctly,
the last one sold for upwards of five
[SPEAKER_00]: grand, probably a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so if you're hunting for these
things, be prepared to wait a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: and to spend, spend a lot, you know,
to spend a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, we'll start at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Silver Haze Bud with trademark
underneath it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to see, it's really
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have Connoisseur's Choice
Cultivated California Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down here, it says Americana 19.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really tell what some of these
things say because my vision's so bad now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, that's some of the inner writing
that's really tiny people have asked to
[SPEAKER_00]: see on the podcast when I get a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have, warning, in some states,
cannabis is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy!
[SPEAKER_00]: Another cool thing are the signs of the
zodiac, because as farmers, we rely on the
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons, and you know, back then,
the farmer's almanac was really big,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this kind of represents that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growing seasons, as you can see,
there's weed leaves under each little
[SPEAKER_00]: horoscope sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all beautifully done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to know who did the art for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of info out there about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we have?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have organically grown acclimatized,
what's that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grown organic, and it's acclimatized
to North America's outdoor, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: realistically, Santa Cruz outdoor,
but they're kind of putting it out there
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's grown and acclimatized,
that they have haze, a sativa over here
[SPEAKER_00]: that is growing right, finishing proper,
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No chemicals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: No seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: They obviously don't want you getting
their seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's somewhere it says,
in nature we trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember where that's exactly at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, then we have my favorite part,
the scale, the triple beam scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that signifies is honest weight,
and the triple beam balance represents
[SPEAKER_00]: ethical business practices, integrity,
and trust, according to Granddaddy Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see it says weight there on
that side, honest on that side,
[SPEAKER_00]: so honest weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, some of this is so light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the enjoy, and it says, enjoy
celebrates the spirit of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation at work in the haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a quick side note that
Granddaddy Mike put on the thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the poster page, and it says,
it is interesting to sometimes,
[SPEAKER_00]: God, it's so hard to read this,
it is interesting to remember that 1975 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 1976 top shelf cannabis was 50 to 60
dollars an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that silver haze was introduced at 250
dollars an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire harvest sold in 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine selling outdoor,
everything gone in 90 days, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for that price?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And real quick, I'll read right here what
the poster says.
[SPEAKER_00]: In clandestine locations sparsely
scattered throughout California,
[SPEAKER_00]: a few dedicated farmers cultivate the herb
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a way of life, anyone can grow weeds
and see the virgin greens, but to
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate the exotic queens beyond your
dreams, you should have dedication,
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitivity to plant life, consistency,
a little basic knowledge, good karma,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a great desire to find harmony with
mama nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basis for any strong, healthy plant is
the soil it grows in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resin producing herbs grow best in soil
that is neutral to semi-sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger the bush or tree, whatever it
may be, the larger the root structure
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots develop most freely in a loose,
rich soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix one yard of soil composed of 30%
mushroom compost, 30% redwood sawdust,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% sandy loam topsoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix organic nutrients, three pounds of
hoof and horn meal, five pounds of rock
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphate, four pounds of kelp,
one pound of natural compost, one pound of
[SPEAKER_00]: iron, five pounds of gypsum, and five
pounds of dolomite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix soil and minerals thoroughly and let
it sit for at least one week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then check the soil with a soil testing
kit for pH and add agricultural lime to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring pH to 7.5 to 8.5 range, semi-sweet
for the connoisseur's treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spring arrives and with it comes new life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fresh spirit and a great hope for the new
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant your favorite seeds on the 6th or
7th of April.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moon is in cancer, best sign for
planting above-ground herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In May, the 3rd, 4th, and 5th are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're still not together, try June 8th
and 9th while the moon is in Scorpio.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you irrigate, make sure that the moon
is in one of those signs when possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancer is the most excellent time to
irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taurus, Scorpio, and Pisces are also good
for irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pruning should be done only in the third
quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patience is the real secret and true test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to make it until December 10th or 11th
when the moon is in Leo and harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions are perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can dig it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In nature we trust, spirit of 76.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Hayes crew, the Santa
Cruz Hayes crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot is known about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hayes Brothers story is very
mysterious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard several iterations of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some from Granddaddy Mike himself that
involves an actual female as one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: main growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always RL.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope he's still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he is, I hope he contacts me because
I'd love to talk to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm not gonna dox the dude or
anything, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, thanks for coming on this Cosmic
Boogie Hayes journey with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I probably talked about this poster
too much, but it's maybe one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: special things and the longest chases I've
had in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for showing up.
