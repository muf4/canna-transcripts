[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_01]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_01]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_01]: seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_01]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The syndicate is a collection of seed
makers that want to push back against all
[SPEAKER_01]: the smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the season finale of season
eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, me and thousand thousand will be
joining us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be going through users
questions and kind of have a relaxed
[SPEAKER_03]: kickback episode to end the season for a
real kind of serious breeding topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, let's kick it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is one we got from Buckshot
Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually a while ago, but we couldn't get
to it and we'll see how we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so Buckshot wants to know,
he says, I've been talking with not so
[SPEAKER_00]: about the early Pearl and how best to
proceed with my goals for finding a long
[SPEAKER_00]: lost, you know, or during a two point no
remake with starting material that's
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: The topic has been brought up to the
syndicate before and it's been discussed
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe speculated that one might be the
unknown indicator never used to make early
[SPEAKER_00]: Pearl improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been planning across with Silver
Pearl to bring the DNA of 90s early pull
[SPEAKER_00]: back into the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so agreed that is a good direction for
a starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also been looking into what pure
indica would have been available to
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville in 8990 and Big Bud fits the
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started Perfect Pearl Seeds from Pip and
Lost Pearl from Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both are Silver Pearl S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, does this sound appropriate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so this is an interesting one
because this is a mix mixture of
[SPEAKER_00]: provenance and what we know of these lines
as well as a breeding question.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Early Pearl is an early, early line
brought to the community by Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure who like the basis for it,
I should say, we're brought to me by Rob
[SPEAKER_03]: Clark.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure who's actually responsible
for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Later on, early Pearl worked its way to
Holland and into Neville Schoenmaker's
[SPEAKER_03]: hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: According to his one of his last partners,
early Pearl ended up being one of his
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite strains ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was constantly working to trying to
find the sweetness that was in the Mexican
[SPEAKER_03]: in early Pearl because he felt like the
sweetness that was coming through in the
[SPEAKER_03]: early Pearl was from the Mexican or
Oaxacan type side.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, that's that's the idea that he
was going for behind early Pearl was the
[SPEAKER_03]: sweetness in that Mexican.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he liked the high a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the high from the Pearls quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're going to do an early Pearl
project like I think that's a great place
[SPEAKER_03]: to start.
[SPEAKER_03]: And mostly because I love Silver Pearl so
much like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, though, I don't remember how
much different like the S1s like from
[SPEAKER_03]: Greenhouse are going to be from like,
say, at one early Pearl clone that went
[SPEAKER_03]: around San Diego.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, early, you know, like there's a
bunch of different ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know how similar they all were
to each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know how similar Silver Pearl
was like the early Pearl clone I saw.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want a basis for provenance
like that, that perfect Pearl from Pippus
[SPEAKER_03]: Killer, some of the best Silver Pearl work
that there is with Silver Pearl,
[SPEAKER_03]: though, there's definitely some skunk
wanted in the in the smells.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's it's a world of other scents,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's one of the few skunk one lines
that really doesn't get too muddled down
[SPEAKER_03]: with skunk one known Silver Pearl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, those lines would be perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know anything about, like I said,
anything about the greenhouse line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not very consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they kind of I mean, they're for their
bait and switching in the first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you never know what you're
going to get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with this line, I've seen it run it,
used it, read with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's an amazing thing to
start with.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the unknown Indica, I think the
big definitely a viable option.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot of reading that Neville
did where he didn't disclose what he was
[SPEAKER_03]: using.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I tend to have the sneaking suspicion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like from knowing Neville
and talking to him and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: messing with them that I think,
you know, usually when I see things like
[SPEAKER_03]: unknown Indica being referenced by
Neville, it immediately makes me think,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, he's probably using Afghani one or
something for Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he hated Sam the skunk man so much
that, like, if there was any use to name
[SPEAKER_03]: his work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's anyone you would strip credit
from, it would totally be Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so, yeah, all he ever did was
don't talk Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I swear to God, he used it in a lot of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and named it other things, called it
other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so that's just a theory.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know some of the other partners share
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Theory with me, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because Buckshot mentioned that his
guess was Big Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I imagine that if it had been,
there's no reason for it to not have been
[SPEAKER_00]: named.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I had a thought here, which is
also because he doesn't mention it,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether Buckshot himself has a sense of
the pearl that he wants to capture,
[SPEAKER_00]: or whether this is kind of like an
abstract, almost like academic thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he doesn't actually have that
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think his family had a early pearl cut
or seed line that they cherished.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why they're going back to
hunting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think they have a lot of experience
with the pearls.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'll be tremendous help.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, obviously, like, if you have a
ton of experience with early pearl and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're running through a bunch of silver
pearl crosses, that's going to be tons of
[SPEAKER_03]: help, you know, to select away from the
skunk one and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Buckshot, I guess you got to keep us
updated on how this goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Buck and his wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I hope you're doing well,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a bit of a broader question,
Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one has more to do with the
industry and maybe ethics and philosophy a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is from Squirrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asks, what's the difference between
a breeder, a seed maker and a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company?
[SPEAKER_00]: He also wants to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also wants to ask you about ghost
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's more to the question that
concerns Josie and Subcool, but maybe I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to, like, include that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just address his first question.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do the first one first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is something like I spent a lot of
my career trying to not necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: educate people on, but try to help define
this for the community and make it very
[SPEAKER_03]: clear that there are different categories
so that when people are shopping,
[SPEAKER_03]: they understand who they're buying from,
what they're buying, and all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the difference between a
breeder, a seed maker.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the last one?
[SPEAKER_03]: What did he say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess maybe that could mean potentially
like a seed bank, maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, let's do breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do breeder, seed company,
seed bank, seed maker seed company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start with a breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is rarely going to be anyone who can
actually call themselves a breeder in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, even though our show is called
The Breeder Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, realistically, looking at
agricultural breeding, I can't call
[SPEAKER_03]: myself, like, a real breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't sit there and work a line for 25
years, bring it to market, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like hunt sports in a line, like all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, that's very much breeding breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: In cannabis, though, we kind of,
considering what we've had, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and who's led the way and how they've done
it, breeding has been a lot different from
[SPEAKER_03]: our cultural perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so much different than ag.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the breeders in our community tend to
be what we consider the people who have
[SPEAKER_03]: worked many lines, multiple generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they start with a goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look at their tools in their toolbox,
be it clones or seed lines, and they say,
[SPEAKER_03]: what can help me get to this goal?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they, you know, they use those
tools and work until they meet that goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be several generations in or it
could be one generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's that's breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Breeding is just goal oriented selection
to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there's seed making and anybody can
make seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that's not that's not a secret.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, anybody can make seeds and anybody
can make seeds that turn out decent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody can make seeds that turn out
insanely fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: But seed making isn't necessarily
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: While you are making seeds, while breeding
a seed maker is one in our community.
[SPEAKER_03]: The definition would be one who makes
seeds, but they're not really into the
[SPEAKER_03]: selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not really working lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing, you know, one off crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's and it's a very valid way
of selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like most of the market is this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say ninety nine point nine percent of
the market is this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do a lot of this one off crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to take it further,
feel free.
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, you know, drop it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the most common thing you're
going to run to in the seed world is seed
[SPEAKER_03]: makers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can have seed makers that do
breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that I've done that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've done more seed making projects
than breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's the majority of our
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have something like a seed
bank and a seed bank is somewhere where
[SPEAKER_03]: you can go and get.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea would be that you can go and get
a multitude of different options of lines
[SPEAKER_03]: from a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually a seed bank hosts many breeders in
cannabis in our culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it's usually gone down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then there are some breeders like CSI
that are so prolific that you can
[SPEAKER_03]: literally get almost any cross from them
and they become a seed bank in themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so prolific.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a rare, rare occurrence.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's people who claim that they
do that, but there's not really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be the overall rundown on that
off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the main differences is goal oriented
versus just strictly production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I know I didn't go into ghost
breeding yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess that that's like a natural
next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess this is when the seed making
itself or breeding, I guess, is outsourced
[SPEAKER_00]: to someone else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of us have done this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see no problem with doing this for
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to be transparent about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of people that hire me don't
want me to be transparent about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's fine, too, because it's their
prerogative.
[SPEAKER_03]: How they how they move their seeds and
sell their seeds isn't up to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to clarify, Matt, you mean that
you've you've done some ghost seed making
[SPEAKER_00]: slash breeding for other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For other seed companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And made seeds for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sold it under their name,
you know, and let them rep that as their
[SPEAKER_03]: strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't really go around telling
people that you made it because you got
[SPEAKER_03]: paid up front.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's your goal is to just do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And their goal is to be the seed maker.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it was a lot more common to see back
in the day, like things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know what's going on today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the ghost breeding, quote unquote,
ghost breeding is done in Spain or in
[SPEAKER_03]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people are buying their seeds bulk
from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I well, I spilled this out in other
episodes, but essentially like in the in
[SPEAKER_03]: the mid 2000s, the way it worked was,
you know, like Amsterdam would source out.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were already making seeds in Spain
and they were making crosses of things
[SPEAKER_03]: like random northern lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that the plant just said NL in
the in the buddha seeds room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Bud White Widow AK 47 White
Russian.
[SPEAKER_03]: White Rhino.
Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hash plant like there's a lot of things
like that, just normal, generic things
[SPEAKER_03]: that you would have seen in like senses
catalog back in the day is what they say
[SPEAKER_03]: they have in Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they make crosses of all of these
feminized crosses of all of them,
[SPEAKER_03]: every single which direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the Dutch companies given a
catalog and they'll look through it and
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll say, oh, this is the closest to
what my Cali mist was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or this is the closest to what the White
Rhino hybrid we had was or this isn't even
[SPEAKER_03]: close to gelato, but fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's put it in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: People won't know the difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Barney's farm, you know,
like their punch or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can name any of their their work work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's essentially how it worked
back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would go through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would try to find something that was
similar, genetically similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would be good enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, 2005 on anybody that bought
anything from Amsterdam from any Dutch
[SPEAKER_03]: company, that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all outsource.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a wrap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spain is making everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is now confused because
everything is being relabeled and renamed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so think of all the breeders
post 2005 that were using Dutch genetics
[SPEAKER_03]: to make their hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Matt, like from the point of view of
these companies or seed banks outsourcing
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff or, you know, kind of picking
from these catalogs, the incentive for
[SPEAKER_00]: them are quite clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously going to be cheaper and
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm curious, then this is a tangent
for you when you were doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the incentive for you or like,
why would you have gotten into it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does one get into that?
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I got into it is because I had
small spaces and the places that wanted me
[SPEAKER_03]: to do these reversals had massive spaces.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though they were choosing what I
got to work with, like I got to see
[SPEAKER_03]: massive populations done in these big
reversals that I was doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my main motive was that just getting to
see populations grown and traits and all
[SPEAKER_03]: of that didn't matter what it was as long
as I was getting to see massive
[SPEAKER_03]: populations, because that was my goal is
to see massive populations and what comes
[SPEAKER_03]: of it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were some interesting benefits
for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes it would be friends,
you know, like friends who had seed
[SPEAKER_03]: companies that were down at the time and
couldn't make the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put it out there and do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and they knew that I do it and
do it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if any of you are still hiring,
you know, I do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how many seed companies are
still in existence after this fallout.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, that was a big thing for
a long time, making FEM seeds for other
[SPEAKER_03]: dudes so they could sell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, in a way,
when you first, when one first hears about
[SPEAKER_00]: this, it might seem immediately like it's
a scummy, scummy or kind of scammy thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not necessarily.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it can be super innocuous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that in that situation, when I do it,
like I'm using the real clones to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're getting the product that you
think you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like, you know, like they
outsourced it and you're getting Calumist
[SPEAKER_03]: white rhino when you think you're getting
wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're actually getting what you're
supposed to be getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only transparency that's not there
usually is who made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of these guys that I did this for
don't even really communicate with the
[SPEAKER_03]: public to say that they made it or didn't
make it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just assumed it's inferred because
they're such big companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't really interact, you know,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's an important distinction to
make as well, that even within this
[SPEAKER_00]: endeavor of ghost breeding or outsourcing
seed making, that there's still a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference as there is with actual
breeding between the people who are using
[SPEAKER_00]: the real material and know what they're
doing versus the people who don't.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's one of the things I definitely
want to put out there, too, is that like
[SPEAKER_03]: Spaniards got shit on a lot because they
were the ones making the seeds that the
[SPEAKER_03]: Dutch were selling.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Spaniards did really good work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I think they were very competent.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guys who were making the bulk seeds
over there were very competent.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were some of the first pioneers doing
massive, massive FEM reversals over in
[SPEAKER_03]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a lot of respect for those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dudes a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just unfortunate how it played
out because like in Spain, it was just a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of dudes with like no ego at all
that wanted to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just wanted to make seeds and they
didn't care about a name.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't care about getting famous at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the onus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the onus was, I guess, more on the the
people using these seeds and selling these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds on and what how they represented
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if there's no transparency,
it makes it kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You think that there's a guy named Barney
at Barney's farm doing all this killer
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding.
Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barney and Berner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Barney and Berner.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is no Barney.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder who Barney is.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't even exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a guy named Gary somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think actually those were a couple of
good insights that you kind of have talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about these things before, but maybe not
in that much depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a tricky thing because, like I said,
yeah, it's political.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the weird thing was that I've got
accused of buying bulk seeds from Spain
[SPEAKER_03]: and selling them.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a company to have to do that,
you have to be a pretty wealthy company
[SPEAKER_03]: moving a lot of seeds to make that viable
method.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're buying bulk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're spending like 20 grand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have 20 grand to be buying bulk
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even financially and economically,
it would never make sense for me to
[SPEAKER_03]: outsource something not that big.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no reason to outsource.
[SPEAKER_03]: The kilowatt hours in Spain versus the US
and the land prices in rent was why a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of people chose, why Spain ended up being
the place to do all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The permissiveness, because it wasn't
super permitted, but it wasn't super
[SPEAKER_03]: attacked.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the local police there and the kilowatt
hour and the space is why, and it's also
[SPEAKER_03]: why Columbia opened up too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And why Columbia is starting to produce a
massive amount of these seeds down there
[SPEAKER_03]: for the breeders up here, the seed makers,
like the compounds or whatever of the
[SPEAKER_03]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mentioned to you that just before we
started recording that I watched the
[SPEAKER_00]: burner video visiting Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to open the cookie store there,
but I also wonder next what Thailand is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to, what kind of platform or
possibilities Thailand is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to say something very,
very, it might hurt a lot of people's
[SPEAKER_03]: feelings.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be a little spicy, but I saw the
worst of California go to the worst,
[SPEAKER_03]: go and be the worst in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they went to Michigan,
the same people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they went to Oklahoma and now
they're all in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just been this downward slide of
failure and refuse all going to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's good dudes there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's good dudes where it, but a lot of
bad dudes went.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of bad dudes that just rip people
off along the way in all these states all
[SPEAKER_03]: ended up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm very interested to see how that
plays out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They went there because they think it's
fucking lawless and they get away with
[SPEAKER_03]: some crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but yeah, I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they know what they're in
for either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe either later in the year or even
2024, we can try and wrangle a Thailand
[SPEAKER_00]: update from someone who's already there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a buddy there right now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be really interesting to watch
his journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's rough, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when he first got over there,
I'm talking about HBK.
[SPEAKER_03]: We interviewed him right before he moved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just watching his journey on Facebook,
even adapting to the food and water was
[SPEAKER_03]: brutal to watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just got so fucked up by that place.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many things that I wouldn't
even think about when thinking about
[SPEAKER_03]: moving to Thailand to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just basic food survival stuff that our
American stomachs can't take.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think this could be an interesting
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe, man, I can discuss this later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, coming back to Squirrel's question,
was there anything else you wanted to say
[SPEAKER_00]: on ghost breeding, Matt, before we moved
on to the second part?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just that it's more prolific than most
people know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to not name names because people
really think these people make their
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds, but the biggest sellers,
the people who make the most money in
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds, the compounds, the seed junkies,
name a few names.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't make their seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have other people make them at these
facilities that are fucking trash,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they don't give a shit who's making
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just need seed to put in a shell,
the cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as there's a physical seed there,
they're good because they don't give a
[SPEAKER_03]: fuck what happens to it afterwards as
everybody saw it with the candy rain
[SPEAKER_03]: incident puppies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody cares.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it is the majority of what
people have in their collections was made
[SPEAKER_03]: ghostbred.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was ghostbred or made in Spain or
Colombia, and they just have no clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess, like you were implying
earlier, ghost breeding in and of itself
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't a good or bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a context, and in some contexts,
it's perfectly innocuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: In another context, it's perfectly
insidious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's as insidious as you can imagine in
some contexts.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, in some, it's very mild,
and it's just a matter of, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least you get what you got.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems it's almost the best you can hope
for anymore, and it's sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, at least you got what you
fucking paid for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it wasn't the dude whose face was on
that picture smiling at you, but at least
[SPEAKER_03]: you got what you paid for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best we can hope for,
really.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to hope for a breeder who will
write you back and be like, okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, if you're interested in this line,
here's some traits and blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear about it all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: People email me and are like, dude,
I'm surprised you even responded.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never had anybody respond before.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's because people don't understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not because they're busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: People just don't know how to answer the
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have answers to the questions
that you're asking if it's about breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people are probably going to get
pissed that I said it, but it's a reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great question because it sums
up quite a bit about the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's one of the most important
topics to probably recover every now and
[SPEAKER_03]: then, just because there's so many new
people coming in that don't know that big,
[SPEAKER_03]: massive part.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it was going on during the
mid-2000s, I was jumping up screen me,
[SPEAKER_03]: stomping my feet, fucking screaming it
from the rafters.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when I was getting banned from
every forum back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't something that everybody knew.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was never an open secret back then
even.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just wasn't talked about and you
weren't allowed to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, Matt, every year or every six
months, there are certain topics that are
[SPEAKER_00]: worth revisiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a good call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just off the top of my head,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be fun to get a Europe update.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be fun to get a Thailand update.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be fun for you to do a reflection on
the American industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I really want to do too is a
prediction episode each year, predicting
[SPEAKER_03]: what's going to happen the next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: What companies will do what?
[SPEAKER_03]: What companies will still be around?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Squirrel's second question,
which is related, also has to do with some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the politics and complexities of
running these companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wants to know about the legacy of
breeders or seed makers who have died and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the messes or complications around
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any anecdotes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the main one that most people
think of when it comes to messes after
[SPEAKER_03]: people pass would probably be Gorilla
Glue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Josie and Lone, I don't want to use a real
name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knows their names, but Josie and
Lone are the people responsible for
[SPEAKER_03]: Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And near the end, they had tried to do a
legal company and there was a lot of cease
[SPEAKER_03]: and desist sent out saying you can't use
Gorilla Glue for clone, which is a clone
[SPEAKER_03]: that was passed to everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And anybody that was using it,
they were saying cease and desist too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't do it to me because we were
friends, but it wasn't even necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: Josie and Lone that were doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had hired some legal stuff and they
had a friend named Kat who's super nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got along with Kat real well,
nice person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she ended up being who had Gorilla
Glue after they both passed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it was just wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was political.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I sat on my Gorilla Glue 4 hybrids
because me and Josie were going to release
[SPEAKER_03]: it as a collab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after he passed, there was some
lawsuits going on with the company.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, fuck this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not dealing with this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get wrapped up in some lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just sat on him forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know CSI, he released Gorilla Glue in
collaboration with Josie and made sure
[SPEAKER_03]: that his family's still getting money for
it too, which I think is so commendable.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all different ways it's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just really depends up to the
person how they handle it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also how the community reacts,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is to say, you can't really ask these
breeders that are passed away if you can
[SPEAKER_03]: use their work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of times, sons pop up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we saw with Bog, he actually had a
real son.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had fake sons pop up after
they died, pretending to sell his gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has happened so many times after
people pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happened with Zochi.
[SPEAKER_03]: When he passed, someone was claiming to be
him, selling his seeds, Goat and Monkey.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's horrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the most disgusting,
horrible things I've seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's more a recent trend when people
die for someone to pop up, pretend to be
[SPEAKER_03]: their son, and sell their seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's been happening a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one weird segment of this question.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as for me, using Lone Star's blue
bonnet specifically, because me and Lone
[SPEAKER_03]: Star weren't tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't enemies by any stretch of
magic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We never argued or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we weren't tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wasn't close with his friends that
are still around.
[SPEAKER_03]: So approaching the blue bonnet stuff was
kind of weird for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it still is to this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I want to make sure that he gets
as much respect as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was beautiful work that made
all of the blueberry stuff that I do that
[SPEAKER_03]: is so super blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did all of the work that made all that
possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I'm looking at my post,
people want to give me credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the whole time, I'm like, I didn't
really do much.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people want to give me credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know how his friends feel
about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't want to necessarily take
credit for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it keeps getting put on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the end, I just try to think about
it from my own perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm gone and the stuff that I had
anything to do with is still passing on
[SPEAKER_03]: and people are still saying my name,
then that's magic.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only way you still live,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of the people may look at it
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: People sue each other over this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you want to mention TJ or talk to TJ?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that was a that was a hard one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he's even hard to talk about
after passing, like, let alone not even
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about using his genetics,
just speaking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of all the things that happened
right like right before the last two years
[SPEAKER_03]: got pretty wild and hairy and humans will
human, especially when they find out
[SPEAKER_03]: they're no longer living.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some will make amends with people and some
will live their life to the fullest that
[SPEAKER_03]: they see fit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and that's kind of what happened
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly what I see, though, in cannabis is
people being sanctified after they pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe unjustly sanctified in many ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you notice, like they're given
sainthood.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see that a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh, this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was such a fucking amazing breeder
collector.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was legit, knew his shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: When he was alive, he was one of the
biggest, you know, like not not even
[SPEAKER_03]: talking to the sub, but just there's a lot
of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot because I mean, people are
complex and not everybody's a good human
[SPEAKER_03]: their whole life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people are really bad humans most
of their life.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when they die in cannabis,
for some reason, they get sainthood.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think some people may not see that
same fate, you know, just kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even people who are alive get that
sainthood and they may not deserve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of sainthood going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, don't as we always say, you know,
be very wary of having heroes kick over
[SPEAKER_03]: the statues.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I say no, don't worship any statues,
don't have any pedestals because breeders
[SPEAKER_03]: like breeders are all fuck ups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like most of us are ex junkies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like whether they admit it or not,
like most of us like have shady paths.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're a bunch of fuck ups.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing to look up to.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for damn sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself, you know, on a positive note,
it is worth kind of reiterating what you
[SPEAKER_00]: said before, which is that, you know,
one of the least, I think, or one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the best things you could do is
just continue to gesture towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: people whose work your work depends on,
like in general, whether they're dead or
[SPEAKER_00]: alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always give, always give thanks and just
not even just give thanks, but just be
[SPEAKER_03]: thankful in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like have that in your heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like don't just say it like having your
heart and carry it with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in your projects, like with the Lone
Star stuff, like I try to think about that
[SPEAKER_03]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I don't, I don't let that slip from
the picture, you know, and maybe that's
[SPEAKER_03]: why I don't get ego with it because it's
not, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just have it in your heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carry, carry that with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't just say it, do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, I think for us at the
Syndicate, it's clearly like a core value
[SPEAKER_00]: to acknowledge that we are just one point
on like a long line of points,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in through running through time
and that like we wouldn't be here without.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot, a lot of, a lot of my focus has
been like trying to find things that other
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders had already made years ago that's
been lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, you know, like some things
were made a long time ago that were so
[SPEAKER_03]: good that we're still digging them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like someone was doing it right back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good that way better than what we have
now even, you know, so yeah, kind of a
[SPEAKER_03]: tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, you know, I think
occasionally it's nice to have a bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: of a like philosophical, you know,
ethical reflection on these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think breeding, breeding ethics is a
one that I used to get asked a lot on the
[SPEAKER_03]: live feeds, you know, about breeding
ethics.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you know if it's okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you ask a breeder?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that, that's a, I mean,
it's a hard one to do because so many
[SPEAKER_03]: people have different answers.
[SPEAKER_03]: People go online and they see breeders
have different reactions to people using
[SPEAKER_03]: their stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I, I almost like think it's silly
when people ask me if they can use my
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff from stuff they bought for me,
you know, like I know they're doing out of
[SPEAKER_03]: respect, but like for me, like if you
bought a pack of seeds, it's yours,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever hell you want with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care whose it is, you know,
like we put it out there, it's there to be
[SPEAKER_03]: put out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you use it, that's, that is a
name's getting carried on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you use it, there's nothing more
like to me special than seeing someone
[SPEAKER_03]: that found something so unique and
special, they wanted to bring it into
[SPEAKER_03]: something and make it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That to me is the ultimate win for a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when people get mad, when people like
use males from their line or use a female
[SPEAKER_03]: from their line or whatever, and want to
kick back, like to me, it blows my mind is
[SPEAKER_03]: the, the, the response.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the name game changed completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: The name game, the name game that used to
be one of the most deadly serious games we
[SPEAKER_03]: played in breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is when we were picking names,
making sure we didn't step on any fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: toes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at one point it was pretty,
there were still names out there you could
[SPEAKER_03]: use that hadn't been reused.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they weren't super obvious,
you know, you could have uniqueness in
[SPEAKER_03]: your name still.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, if you weren't too creative,
it was very easy to step on toes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't like it is today where
people are like, ah, whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, because there's so many names
you can't avoid, but you're using names
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back then, like people took that very
serious and with like, message you and be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to watch your head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you better change that now or else,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's another thing that's
definitely changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is our policy today is were you here
before me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: If not fucking kick rocks kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, are you here before me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you don't get to choose the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get to keep the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dick move.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to start somewhere, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, slight change of pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: We come back to a much more practical set
of questions, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think from freeze blade, you know,
when do you think is the best time to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: to take clones or to take cuttings off
plots?
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by it depends, it means any number of
factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a seedling mom?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a clone mom?
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a seedling mom, you know,
is it going to fuck up the whole structure
[SPEAKER_03]: of the plant if I take the clones or am I
not really worried about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's many reasons like that I go
into when I'm taking clones or things that
[SPEAKER_03]: I take into account.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is this going to be something that
I'm flowering out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I taking clones in a specific spot from
the plant to make it have a specific
[SPEAKER_03]: structure when it's flowering?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's a big part of what part
of the plants clones I'm taking,
[SPEAKER_03]: how many I take the shape of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That all goes into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually for me, I wait till it's about two
to three feet tall before I start making
[SPEAKER_03]: clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some people do it at the first
two nodes, you know, like once there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf material to take and there's a node,
bam, take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that context, do you see, have you
experienced or observed maturity playing a
[SPEAKER_00]: very big role in the success of rooting or
not necessarily?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, nothing that I could like,
not good anecdotes that I could give,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm sure there is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, hormonally a plant changes over
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sure there is, but what I'm talking
about there, they're already so big at
[SPEAKER_03]: that point that you're not really worried
about the maturity as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and when I run my plants,
I usually run a veg at 24 hours,
[SPEAKER_03]: like almost always.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't think of a situation where I've
been running anything less than 24 hours
[SPEAKER_03]: in veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's constant, constantly on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason I do that is because I also
do a lot of revegging.
[SPEAKER_03]: In saying that, like, I mean, my plants
grow pretty fast in veg because the lights
[SPEAKER_03]: are on 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, two, three feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not, you know, there's no heavy
pre-flowering going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of people taking
cuttings in the flowering stretch?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's quite common slash popular
as well, I guess, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get so much like extra vegetative
growth often that you have to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of pulling cuttings at
that point?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what point are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Later in flower or early in flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the flowering stretch, first few
weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times they'll have stems that'll
root better too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why, but like they have
woodier stems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for some reason, I have better luck
with woodier stems like that, or harder
[SPEAKER_03]: stems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hormonally, I think they're,
for whatever reason, they're more able to
[SPEAKER_03]: root at that stage hormonally,
because they do root faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found that out just by process of,
like, thinking I had something backed up
[SPEAKER_03]: and clones backed up, going to flower
something, starting in flower and
[SPEAKER_03]: realizing, oh shit, I don't have any more
clones of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then having to take clones that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when I started realizing that there
was kind of a difference between how fast
[SPEAKER_03]: they would root, how well they would root,
and the type of roots they gave off even.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I've run into that just by
happenstance.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take cuttings at that point,
do you have to deal with re-vegging or not
[SPEAKER_00]: really?
[SPEAKER_03]: It just depends sometimes, but usually
it's not a very super long re-veg,
[SPEAKER_03]: if anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a week or two max.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you get it at the right time,
not usually, it'll revert pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love re-vegging.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me sad when people say that they
don't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it's so easy to do and I don't have
a lot of talents in life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even when it comes to growing,
I don't have a lot of talents when it
[SPEAKER_03]: comes to growing that I'm better at this
than anyone else or better at that than
[SPEAKER_03]: anyone else.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm really good at re-vegging and I'm
really good at popping seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are two things that I can do
exceptionally well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And re-vegging to me, it's something I
could teach anyone at any time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as long as you follow a few simple
fucking rules, anybody could do it
[SPEAKER_03]: anytime, as long as you can put your
lights on 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of people do have trouble with
it and I don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just one of those things I've never
gotten.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would people have trouble with
re-vegging?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an awesome technique.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have to be very patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess to me, the main costs of
re-vegging would be space and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll always say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the 24-hour light, a lot of people
don't want to do that because it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: doubling your flower cycle of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
True.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can get more expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: That extra six hours of light a night
is... That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can move on to Digger's question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you had a sense of what he's
asking here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what he's talking about, I think,
is using the male as basically a stud,
[SPEAKER_03]: using all of his traits onto the females.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I mean, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it with a female or a male.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it with a male.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no set.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing set with all males bring
this trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: All females breed this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so variable down to the plant and
environment on what traits are passed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very hard question to answer,
but yes, you can absolutely... With the
[SPEAKER_03]: bonnet stuff, that's exactly what I did,
was breed towards the male.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was what you would actually consider
a stud because I wanted everything to be
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry that he touched and was
successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And historically, it's been done a lot,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very common pattern.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes in the way of Skunk 1 was used as a
male a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: NL1 was used as a male a lot by Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: But overall, there's been a lot of seed
making with males.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not been a lot of breeding done
with a male.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the whole goal for trait
selection like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good distinction.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else on that?
No.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stone root.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on convergent
evolution through breeding, starting with
[SPEAKER_00]: rather different cultivars, but ending up
at the same place through a series of
[SPEAKER_00]: generations?
[SPEAKER_00]: He says similar to crabs in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you experienced this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'll say though right away is
that crabs in the ocean were not bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: They evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know what he means.
[SPEAKER_00]: He means that throughout the different
eras of creatures on the planet,
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a few different species,
I don't know if I have the right taxonomy
[SPEAKER_00]: here, but quite a few different species
have kind of converged on a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology, a very crab-like morphology
throughout time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that is conflatable with
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because breeding is actually active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he said two different cultivars,
but that would mean they were both
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the crab thing was meant to be an
analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kind of explaining why the
analogy doesn't really make sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but like with this question,
he said two different cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it sounded like he was almost talking
about- He just said with different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not even necessarily cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he talking about just two different
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does mean cannabis, I'm assuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I was saying to you before the
recording, the most obvious thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to mind that it's not breeding is
what happens when you just let drug-type
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis go wild, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can watch it regress very quickly
to hemp in a few generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know if this makes sense if
you're talking about it from a breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the only thing I can think of from
a breeding perspective that even remotely
[SPEAKER_03]: comes close to this is someone currently
crossing hops and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two different kind of semi-related plants
and finding a way to interbreed them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not done evolutionarily,
it's not done naturally, it was done
[SPEAKER_03]: through breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: What he's talking about takes thousands
and thousands and thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like evolution, it's done through
evolution, not through humanity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless we're talking about major,
major GMO-type stuff, advanced science
[SPEAKER_03]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't know anything about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think you make a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really have evolution and
breeding in the same sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not simpatico.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go, nice and loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to Skrewston Scarecrow's
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he says, men also have talked about
growing for seed versus growing for flower
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about the difference between
having what he calls a regular veg setup
[SPEAKER_00]: versus a setup that's more for
preservation?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, you know, keeping moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: How different are those setups?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can they be?
[SPEAKER_00]: How different can they be?
[SPEAKER_03]: From seed making to keeping moms?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think he means production.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the differences between a setup
that you're using just to grow plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow plants for, I guess, for cropping
versus a setup that's just for keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so if I were doing just cropping,
I would probably be doing a lot in tables,
[SPEAKER_03]: a ton.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm keeping moms, you can't really keep
moms in tables.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know anybody who does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you explain a bit why?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because they get so big.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't really have those big monster
moms in tables, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: keeping them around a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also depends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people like to do clone of their mom,
clone of their mom, clone of the mom,
[SPEAKER_03]: keep it small, constantly clone of the
mom, clone of the mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you do it that way and keep it small?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way you could do it in tables,
technically.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could also use tables and re-veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's workarounds for every situation,
but ideally, if I have moms, I have a
[SPEAKER_03]: whole room dedicated to that of just moms
in pots, in containers, in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then if I'm running production,
usually if I'm running production for me,
[SPEAKER_03]: I do it all in the same pots and stuff
like that, but it's because I rent.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I owned a place, I would be doing all
fucking tables all day, all day long.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the only difference would be how
you keep the moms longer in a mom room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like you were saying earlier,
it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what constraints you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a lot of space,
then you might have to resort to what you
[SPEAKER_00]: were pointing out before, what I call
serial cloning, where you don't actually
[SPEAKER_00]: have a mom that you're constantly just
taking clones off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're cloning and then taking a clone off
that clone and doing that successively
[SPEAKER_00]: through time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did that for years, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did it for years that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Solo cup moms, bonsai moms, which is
horrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't understand that I was super
stunting shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then now I'm going to take that and breed
with this super stunted plant because I
[SPEAKER_03]: made a bonsai mom out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't understand what I was doing back
then.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the ramifications that has
for the future of what I made back then
[SPEAKER_03]: with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just thinking about that, that was the
stunted moms and recycled clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a really big question that
I think we still don't really have great
[SPEAKER_00]: answers for, which is like you say,
let's say you have a mom and then you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been forced to stress slash traumatize it
in various ways to keep it small.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of impact that does have on
clones you take off it later?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even the seeds that you make with it
epigenetically.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what happens there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this is something, if anyone in the
community has an idea or has seen any
[SPEAKER_00]: theory around this, definitely let us
know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kaimira, if you want, just let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the other side of this in terms of
setup is I can think of things like basic
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you probably have already
thought through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other differences in like say light
intensity, the feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've covered a bit of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, feeding definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Light intensity, here's a weird one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the topic, but kind of a tangent.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of us are getting news, like a lot
of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like the oldest ones of us are
just getting used to LEDs now or just
[SPEAKER_03]: getting to try them for the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is so fucking different,
like how the plants eat and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so massively different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I mean, there are a lot of things
to take into account to just from light
[SPEAKER_03]: intensities on feed and all that shit,
not just for breeding, but for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's I'm someone who's only ever had
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's a trip for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I started on magnetic ballast and T5s
and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I still have T5s that I would use
because I'm fucking old.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's a legit technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never moved on to LEDs, mostly
because I'm broke and cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if anybody wants to be an LED sponsor,
get a hold of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to use this shit.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, anything else about the differences
between keeping plants for an archive
[SPEAKER_00]: versus keeping plants for production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any changes in your... Obviously,
it's a different mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, obviously it's a different
strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, if nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's I can't think of anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can move on to South Coast Kanna's
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Random one, but does a male have different
traits as... OK, I guess what he's asking
[SPEAKER_00]: here is how differently can a male plant,
but I think it doesn't have to be just
[SPEAKER_00]: about a male, how differently can a plant
express when seed growing versus like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as a cutting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Vastly different, vastly different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's why I always say like, if you're
really serious about it, about like a line
[SPEAKER_03]: and hunting through it, do run at all as
seeds, flower them, and then run it as
[SPEAKER_03]: clones before you toss them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because sometimes that change might be so
drastic that the turps change so far that
[SPEAKER_03]: you might have already tossed a keeper if
you haven't run it the second time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you break this down a little bit,
Matt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that like in the past,
whatever I remember you saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I know, for example, that the
expression of intersex expressions change
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you're actually saying that even
turf expressions might be different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scent, internoid spacing, all kinds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because it's there's so many
different hormones packed into that
[SPEAKER_03]: seedling mom, which is why it grows so
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you as it ages, as you take clones
of that, those hormones start to wear out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and you get to see a totally
different plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just grows totally different as a
clone, different root system, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that for me anyway,
I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no main taproot on a clone,
you know, like there's not like that big
[SPEAKER_03]: hard main taproot like a seedling gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another one where I think,
you know, there probably is quite a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: science underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anyone can chip in on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone can chip in on this topic,
we could probably revisit this because it
[SPEAKER_00]: is quite an interesting and big one.
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else in terms of
differences that you could think of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, beyond the fact that they
are going to be potentially pretty major
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any anecdotes in particular, Matt,
that you can think of or?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just something that we see
every single time that we run a plant like
[SPEAKER_03]: every single time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to change from seedling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not all of them change drastically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some are real minor changes, just,
you know, leaf shape with sometimes you
[SPEAKER_03]: just see that are a little bit stockier,
a little bit longer, but sometimes it can
[SPEAKER_03]: be worlds apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that bubblegum clone of the
Northern Lights five was so pink bubblegum
[SPEAKER_03]: when we first got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're blown mind blown by it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as a as a clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: About third generation in a lot less pink
bubblegum, a lot less.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is a this is a fascinating
topic, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of complexity here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is very sciencey.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a couple of questions from in
the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think generally what I get from in
the wind's questions here is he's taken
[SPEAKER_00]: into account some of the theory that we've
explained in the previous episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on some of the complexities of
breeding, like we pointed out,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are linked linked traits,
i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that are linked or grouped together
for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the inverse of that we
talked about, I think, where we you could
[SPEAKER_00]: even have multiple genes controlling a
single trait.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, the vibe I get from him is
like, OK, that that that sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding is like impossible or like
intentional breeding is impossible because
[SPEAKER_00]: of these conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, it's it's true that it's
extremely difficult to to make
[SPEAKER_00]: predictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But OK, we'll get into his first one,
which is how much of our assessment of
[SPEAKER_00]: linked traits and true breeding traits can
actually be observed in like can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: be observed full stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what I see in this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says how much of it is like visual and
can be perceived through effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of its visual except for effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to think, am I correct in saying
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like most of the traits that we breed for
are visual, observable, observable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, observable is better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Consent is not, you know, observable in
some way, except for the high.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always going to be variable for
every single person, every single
[SPEAKER_03]: different time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like trying to explain this to the like
normal person who goes into a collective,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're so mindset on thinking,
do I need the TV or hybrid?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like that's where their mindsets
at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas like in my mindset, I'm at I
wonder if this bud from this plant is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to affect me the same way it did
last night when I was in a different mood,
[SPEAKER_03]: because in reality, that's where we should
be at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like it's that variable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So trying to quantify high and breeding
for high very hard, very hard,
[SPEAKER_03]: because you never know if the next person
is going to have the same higher,
[SPEAKER_03]: the same reaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't know that if you're going to
have the same higher reaction the next
[SPEAKER_03]: time you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in some sense, it can be too variable
to account for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are variables we can account for
and breed for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of those questions where
like there isn't a straightforward answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it depends on what traits you are
interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, within within the tools
that you have, like if all you have are
[SPEAKER_00]: your observations, then obviously you can
only you can only depend on what you
[SPEAKER_00]: observe to make your decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's just there's no magic
shortcut to that if you don't have access
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, other kinds of testing.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is where knowing your baselines,
having experience running out the
[SPEAKER_03]: baselines, going through populations in
the baselines for baselines, see our
[SPEAKER_03]: previous episodes, recent episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Having that experience will help you to
make those selections and see those traits
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're looking for and know,
OK, well, it breeds about this common in
[SPEAKER_03]: this line.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about that common.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully I'll see it in this,
you know, roughly this percentage in this
[SPEAKER_03]: population of this hybrid, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the more you know the lines
you're working with or clones you're
[SPEAKER_03]: working with, the more educated you can be
about making those distinctions and
[SPEAKER_03]: projections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we we did talk about this as
well, which is that sometimes you do have
[SPEAKER_00]: to go forward and then go backwards
because you just don't have any other way
[SPEAKER_00]: of getting more information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sometimes it's literally you have to
run the progeny and not everything's
[SPEAKER_03]: ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his second question is, I think we've
more or less covered it, but I'll sound it
[SPEAKER_00]: out anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said, yeah, how reliable is a
visual, sorry, observable slash like smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: test in the search for unique expressions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kind of goes into like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it possible for something to not
express the trait in its first expression?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess he means in the first generation
and then for that trait to appear in
[SPEAKER_00]: successive generations, obviously,
yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very, very much so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how recessives work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they pop up in the F2s,
F3s.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll never see them in the F1s or in
that first generation crotch, I should
[SPEAKER_03]: say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's that's that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's a part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a major thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I perceive underlying this
question, his his real question is,
[SPEAKER_00]: how can I predict this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like it's the same answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, either you have very good
information and previous experience on how
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're holding does pass and breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you're going to have to actually do
some work, test the progeny and maybe do
[SPEAKER_00]: another generation if that's what you're
looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're trying to trace
something down generations, you just have
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't avoid actually doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially, you know, and to this point,
like I would would rather see someone pop
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 seeds in a very small space and flower
them small to get an idea of the
[SPEAKER_03]: population than run two or three plants
really big to try to get an idea of what a
[SPEAKER_03]: clone's like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like if people are wondering,
like, which would be better, which would
[SPEAKER_03]: be more ideal, which would give them the
most information, the smaller plants would
[SPEAKER_03]: give you the most information and that
would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smaller plants can be just as chirpy and
potent as anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we're going for assessing and
learning about a plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: as long as it has enough bud to get you a
few fucking bulls so you can get a pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: good idea if it's even a high you enjoy,
you personally enjoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just flower them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little clones, little little seedlings.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess my paraphrase for that is
whenever you are looking for stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you face significant odds and the only
strategy that's viable is to go with
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Numbers always.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can move on.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: NJ Grow Guy is asking a question that I
think, you know, is always the question in
[SPEAKER_00]: a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the best way to go about extending
stock on a pack of seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a 12 pack and want to make more so
I can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw them out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you just OP that pack or would you
go and select, you know, maybe do one to
[SPEAKER_00]: one with your favorite from the pack?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so in this case, you know what I'd
say?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say if you have like 12 seeds,
I'd run them all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep clones of each just in case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if it's already an open pollination,
there might not be a need to do a
[SPEAKER_03]: successive open pollination unless it's
solely for preservation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, you feel like the last person
probably didn't do that good of a job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if someone just did it from five
seeds, I would probably re OP it again,
[SPEAKER_03]: just, you know, just because to bring out
more examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Open pollinations are great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if this is solely for
preservation, do open pollinations,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's some lines where it's like
someone just didn't open pollination and
[SPEAKER_03]: it won't kill you to just do little
selections from it to make the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would be doing directional breeding in
a sense and start that direction
[SPEAKER_03]: narrowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, if it's plants that you like
as opposed to just random and you've
[SPEAKER_03]: already run them, then yeah, that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think again, this is one of those like
it depends and it comes down to your
[SPEAKER_00]: constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, I imagine the risk with OP is
that I think we did address this in the
[SPEAKER_00]: theory episode as well, is that it's easy
to lose things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not to say that you've lost them
forever, but that's why I say it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: down to your constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have plenty of time in the future
and you know, you're going to have lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe an OP is okay, but yeah,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're like, if you're doing an OP
strictly, so you can do a big ass pop of
[SPEAKER_03]: this one line, that makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're just OP in it just to pop
three seeds, that doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good, that's a good
summary statement.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patty Cheetah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've selected a stable female from an
intersex prone line and out-crossed it to
[SPEAKER_00]: a male from a stable line.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your experience, despite choosing a
stable individual, how often do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: the intersex traits from the female side
get passed into the progeny?
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends again, cause we don't know if
that trait is a link trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know much about that trait,
you know, like for this particular
[SPEAKER_03]: example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically, typically, generally speaking
though, if you're, if you're breeding away
[SPEAKER_03]: from intersex traits, let's say this line
is very, very arm prone and you find a
[SPEAKER_03]: male from a line that's just super stable
sexually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually you're doing a great service to
the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: If your end goal is to have no intersex
traits, that's, that's what you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, that's the best method.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best method for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's the trait you're trying to like
suppress, that's how you would do it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Squirrel again is asking, let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think his question is we often
address traits such as, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most common ones like scent,
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's wondering like, and we have
talked a bit about this before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but do you have much experience with
people who have bred for bud structure for
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking specifically?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not that I know of, but I mean,
maybe someone does out there that's an
[SPEAKER_03]: actual breeder, but I don't know of it and
I haven't had that discussion with anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I've talked about it because I,
I hate, I fucking hate with a passion,
[SPEAKER_03]: super dense bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I like to break up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, my preference has always been to break
it up by hand really easy, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: not, not thumb it up super bad,
but I don't know how to handle bud,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, but I like to break it up by
hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And pretty much nowadays I have to use a
grinder every single time because this
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff is so dense that it would just,
it's pointless to try to break it apart
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't like shit that dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of customers, customers don't
eat it because it's usually mold prone,
[SPEAKER_03]: like massively mold prone stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say that even if people in
their work haven't been explicitly looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for flower structure relative to smoking,
people certainly pay attention to how
[SPEAKER_00]: prone flowers are to bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is often the kind of corresponding
consideration.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially for the grower side,
more dense, more density means more mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, that's why I just can,
I never could believe that cookies blew up
[SPEAKER_03]: like it did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only was it a smaller yielder,
but the density just made it a mold
[SPEAKER_03]: nightmare for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it just blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question here for you,
Matt, which you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Indiana bubblegum cut is often cited
for being really mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you, uh, in your, in your opinion,
like, is it partly the structure of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower that contributes to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it other, are the other qualities
you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's pretty dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as dense as like cookies,
but it's very dense Afghani type.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just one of those things where the
genetics, it's just very mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an example where it wasn't,
it wasn't, it's not necessarily because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower structure that it's mold
resistant.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, um, a lot of the Erdbeer stuff,
the Swiss sativa strawberry stuff also
[SPEAKER_03]: tends to be mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't, I like early on, I was trying
to figure out if it was tied to its scent,
[SPEAKER_03]: like whatever the oils are in its glands,
you know, whatever, I never figured it
[SPEAKER_03]: out, but the strawberry stuff is extremely
mold resistant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I guess, yeah, paraphrase of that is
the other obvious way something can be
[SPEAKER_00]: mold resistant is presumably through its
cannabinoid like rebalance and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that might actually be the end of our
questions today, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we are at the end of the
questions, I know that you wanted to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, which one should I talk about first?
[SPEAKER_00]: So did you want to talk about your,
your recent experience with cereal milk
[SPEAKER_03]: and tell us what that is and what I'll
tell you about my experience, the rundown
[SPEAKER_03]: on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to check out some of these new
buds because I had not tried cereal milk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had not tried jealousy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a bunch I hadn't tried from a lot
of the hype stuff, not just cookie cam
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, but in general, generally speaking,
um, a lot of the newer stuff I haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: tried and people ask me a lot about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my normal comment is well,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it cookies crossed to cookies?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like in my opinion, that's
usually what you get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I got some and I probably should
have taken pictures, but I figured it's
[SPEAKER_03]: cereal milk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm probably not going to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, I was that confident that I
would not enjoy this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that is a bias coming with a bias
to not wanting to enjoy this and not even
[SPEAKER_03]: not wanting to, but expecting to not enjoy
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the bud shows up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look at it is very dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, expected.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the density is just exactly like,
I hate hard to break up and there's not a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of scent to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was expecting cereal milk to smell like
the sweet end of OG that actually smells
[SPEAKER_03]: like cereal milk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, I thought the name would be
apropos and some kind of extension of
[SPEAKER_03]: that, because that exists in that line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you not choose that expression
to represent it?
[SPEAKER_03]: But they didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think the name is a misnomer scent
wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very bland, um, turps, which also
threw me off as far as like, I'm expecting
[SPEAKER_03]: this to not be very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's turpless in a sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't really even pin down a scent for
you on what it smelled like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just hashy maybe at best.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I smoke it and about 30 minutes in,
I'm already expecting this thing to be
[SPEAKER_03]: over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I'm actually enjoying this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm giggly.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is giggly weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had been dabbing diamonds in sauce all
day and it broke through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it repeatedly did that until the very
last bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because I spent so much time talking
about like cookies being the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding, as far as like the very end of
where you can take that line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't know much about snowman.
[SPEAKER_03]: And wildlife, obviously it's some kind of
cookies, cookies, you know, but I was
[SPEAKER_03]: impressed and I felt like, like,
even though I want so badly not to say
[SPEAKER_03]: that cereal milk is, is decent,
like it was pretty fucking decent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because I talked so much shit,
I had to actually, you know, man up and
[SPEAKER_03]: say that it was, it was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I'm going to try to do that more
often, grab some stuff now and then from
[SPEAKER_03]: newer stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, maybe do some reviews for
people so that they can see it and get an
[SPEAKER_03]: idea of someone who's more used to old
school strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: What my opinion would be on stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's worth the shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hella surprised that I would even
run that clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was that good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though it was turpless,
I would like, I wouldn't, if I was an
[SPEAKER_03]: extractor, I would never run that shit,
but the high from it was exceptional.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I don't think the grower was
anything special, but I do think that I
[SPEAKER_03]: was exceptional.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I got to give them props where
it's due.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had someone make them a good line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess it's still consistent,
you know, despite with what we say,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, despite, of course us enjoying
bashing on cookies for various good
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's obviously no reason why,
uh, outliers within that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: can't appear and be good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the part that blew my mind
though, was that it didn't look like
[SPEAKER_03]: anything different than a gelato,
you know, looking at me like, oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a lot of 33, you know, the smell,
nothing to write home about at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, it was one of the more scentless
buds that I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for whatever reason, and like that
totally shits on that entourage effect
[SPEAKER_03]: type thing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it totally, it's the opposite of how
it should have worked in my brain,
[SPEAKER_03]: if that's real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it did it and it had a great
fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking,
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking high,
like markedly great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that I don't see in cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's, it's definitely,
um, that, that clone at least,
[SPEAKER_03]: or the, the example, maybe maybe it wasn't
even cereal milk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who fucking knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: It came from a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: So God knows, but I'm pretty sure it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, yeah, it was impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the implications of this
statement, Matt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you, are you telling everyone that
cookies is great and that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: blow burner is what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make me, he's my puppy,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what this means, but it's,
uh, what it means is that I need to start
[SPEAKER_03]: giving some of these new things to try and
see if, if, uh, I can't break some of my
[SPEAKER_03]: own myths that I have in my head about
them, or I can't prove myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm determined now to at least like
maybe once a week, if I can afford it,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's expensive, man, legal weeds,
expense the taxes on this unreal,
[SPEAKER_03]: unreal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I would like to do that though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once a week, you know, grab some,
grab one, even one or two things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, like another thing that
I got that I, that I'd like to talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: that blew my mind to mango haze diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it didn't blow my mind for the reasons
that you think it would.
[SPEAKER_03]: It blew my mind that someone would grow
like a 14 to 16 week plant and then
[SPEAKER_03]: extract it down to diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who came up with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who came up with that idea and why did I
buy it?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was no scent to it really.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't have an exceptional high at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was nothing mango hazy about the
high to me, you know, like if it was used,
[SPEAKER_03]: if it was a real 14, 16 week grown mango
haze, it was lost in the extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, I don't see any of these people
running a 14 to 16 week haze and
[SPEAKER_03]: extracting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's probably ran at eight and
extracted.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and at that point you just have
THC diamonds and you could have that from
[SPEAKER_03]: anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wouldn't matter cause there's no,
nothing else with it except just THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a very, very specific high,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it was almost offensive that,
um, mango haze diamonds existed and I
[SPEAKER_03]: couldn't believe they existed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I even tried them in hopes that they
would be something good, that they would
[SPEAKER_03]: just work diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can, I can totally see why it's
offensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like sacrilegious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like why, why, like they could have done
live resin sauce and I'd been like,
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking dope, but they did diamonds,
like straight, just THC diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In which case, why would you use something
like mango haze?
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: You could use anything on earth to do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you use a 14, 16 week plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was my experience at the local
collectives.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some, um, a funny tale was that
the place where I got the, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: Juicy Fruit Tie Clone, I had Juicy Fruit
on their menu again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're growing that again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was going to order it, but I didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I don't remember why, cause I was
buying everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was too damn expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, you know, but they gave me a full
free ounce of their Juicy Fruit and holy
[SPEAKER_03]: balls was the most moldy bullshit I've
ever seen in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't even identify if it was Juicy
Fruit or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I had to be the dickhead that
hits him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Hey bro, that's if you're
giving out, it's all moldy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want to check that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it doesn't look good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, even though it's free, like you're
repping your business, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't say which business cause they're
nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously they have my address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's a great idea for you to
periodically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how often, um, get some
products to review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's, that's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like for me, you know, I have no other
connection to dispensary land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can vicariously live through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's, that was my experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, um, what else did I get?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some, something called Inferno OG
diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that actually was like, had some
really loud, loud OG sense to it in the
[SPEAKER_03]: diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really fucking impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was some of the best diamonds in
the sauce I've ever had, but it was just
[SPEAKER_03]: diamonds, but I didn't really see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see any sauce, but it was so loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: OG, um, smelling is exactly like I would
have wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there was some, uh, Mars OG,
the place was selling and that was just
[SPEAKER_03]: absolute garbage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, uh, just really poorly grown,
like Athena grown, you know, just fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: smashed with nudes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not like a really nice OG scent to
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I like, or flavor that was gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just earthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really disappointing to be honest with
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I used to love Mars OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a really good OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, eh, I can't really think of anything
else that, that jumped out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, uh, of note.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a Jack Harrow live resin sauce.
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't that good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't that special.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't even that Turpinoli,
which is weird for a Jack Harrow live
[SPEAKER_03]: resin sauce, but it was in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just wasn't as loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Overall disappointing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really do collectives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've never really done that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had been a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it usually, if I'd ever got anything
from a collective, it would be a clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's something that interested me,
you know, Oh, that's right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if it's it, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, what a trip, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a trip, the taxes, the trash level of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it surprisingly though,
like I said, some of it was fucking good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to get something decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess you could say the same of
like collectives and dispensaries as,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you just did about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we did about cookies in general,
like obviously it doesn't mean that like
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all bad and everything's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just what the likelihood is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and yeah, there's obviously still a
chance that you can get some, some good
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's funny is some of my friends are the
people growing weed for cookies that goes
[SPEAKER_02]: in those mylars, you know, like,
yeah, some of it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, I don't know, man, is this a
good point to like do a little bit of an
[SPEAKER_00]: outro?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, maybe this is where we talk about,
well, we've decided that this is the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of this season.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, this episode, that's one of the series
end of everything by we're done.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've covered everything, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing else to say about
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I think that's it for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I didn't want to point out is
that we just hit 7,000 subs, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I'll tell you why I'm proud of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons is that I occasionally
go and look at other cannabis channels,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially ones that I really hate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I've noticed that I think is
so absurd, but also so unsurprising is
[SPEAKER_00]: that some of these channels you go and
then you see they've got like 100 or like
[SPEAKER_00]: 200,000 subs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you go and look at their,
the actual views that they get on their
[SPEAKER_00]: videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like a couple of thousand every
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of these channels don't have
real subscribers or if they do,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're a tiny portion of the numbers that
they claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what I've loved seeing from our
data, our analytics is that our subscriber
[SPEAKER_00]: base is real because a good portion of
people show up every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so not only have we grown organically,
we actually have a proper regular
[SPEAKER_00]: following.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is something that you
can't take for granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't think that this,
I'm not trying to like be too
[SPEAKER_00]: self-deprecating or anything, but you
know, what we, the kinds of information
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're interested in are very niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we may not get, or may not even
want to have a hundred thousand subs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to be able to develop a proper close
following with regular people showing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's very special in content
land.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never thought it would happen for
cannabis genetics because it is so niche.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes certain type of personalities to
be this into learning about what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking, why it's affecting you the way it
does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like keeping track, like the whole
provenance of everything and just trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to get to the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's super fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot of weirdos like us out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So every time that I see like our
subscriber count growing, it tells me
[SPEAKER_03]: there's more people that are fascinated by
this topic and deeply fascinated by it at
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that it blows my fucking mind because
I just watching the forums over the years,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, just a few hundred people
interacting on each one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the best you'd get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of them are really mean and
weren't there for good reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are all like our, our community
is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I died tomorrow, it would run itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's so fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I mean, I, I feel like that's
possibly an exaggeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you could die tomorrow and
just run, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, no, hopefully we won't see.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm calling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm calling a hit on Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thousand phone show from New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Live from New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Reader's etiquette.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was I going to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my paraphrase of what Matt just
said though, is that what makes me happy
[SPEAKER_00]: is that there are people who are
interested in finding out the truth or at
[SPEAKER_00]: least as much of the truth as they can,
because that's what we're into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is, it is heartwarming to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is encouraging to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other side of, I think this ending the
season on this note, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we, we, we covered the whole breeding
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really comprehensive and our,
I found myself actually quite exhausted
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards and like not knowing what we,
what kinds of, what other episodes we
[SPEAKER_00]: could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but in saying that, I think Matt and
I have some good ideas for the next
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we are also toying with some,
like trying out some new kinds of content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it actually come to
fruition, but like we joked at least about
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe doing reaction videos to like strain
hunters or maybe like burners,
[SPEAKER_00]: like funny documentaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe we'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm also thinking about doing like
watching UFO videos and getting really
[SPEAKER_03]: fucked up and commenting on them as
reaction videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you already kind of do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't, I don't record it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like let people watch me do stupid
shit and talk over UFO videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might be funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say stupid shit when I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we, we've definitely also got a
few guests in mind, a couple of whom we've
[SPEAKER_00]: actually like lined up and, and a few more
of whom we still need to line up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still plenty more good stuff to come.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know what I love that this season
thousand fold got to figure out how hard
[SPEAKER_03]: it is to run the show behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get people communicate and like,
you know, it's not as easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the funny thing is that, you know,
I can, I kind of look back on a week and
[SPEAKER_00]: count the hours and be like, oh,
it's not, it's not that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think what happened, why it feels
kind of like it, it stretches throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the week is because yeah, the side of the
week, we, we have to decide what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have to try to coordinate,
uh, like the planning and recording of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course it actually gets
published later in the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually kind of like an endless
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I think now I'm like,
now that I've seen what I've seen,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like forcing Matt into more and more
like organization being like, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to start like scheduling things in
advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make a list, like a schedule
of episodes that we can cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, he has no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in, I'm the, I'm the opposite of
schedule and organization.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt's put up with like, Matt's kind of
been really, um, open to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what I've had to bring so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's good shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I think everybody, all the
feedback has been great for this season.
[SPEAKER_03]: People really enjoyed the content they've
enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people have really
enjoyed being able to have some like from
[SPEAKER_03]: point A to point B to point C to point D
as opposed to trying to look at through my
[SPEAKER_03]: ADHD brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's everything that I produce is
very spastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's just left up to me to bring it to
me, it's just how I do things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just random thoughts at all times.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think people really have enjoyed
being able to like follow along and
[SPEAKER_03]: actually follow along.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking forward to the next season too,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all I had to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you know, go to righttease.com for
your spray seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We carry stuff from all the Canna Luminati
dudes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, goat farm, I am lonesome, even got
some Panda stuff on the freebies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably going to have some Panda stuff in
the future, like carried.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, who else?
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the rev smellboat CSI collabs with
not so right now we've got the,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, the few cherry pie collabs up that
they just did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go check those out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just dropped.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, of course our community has
really, really been built through our
[SPEAKER_03]: Patreon discord.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's made a family.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's made an absolute family.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love some of these people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's gonna be a lot of lifelong
friends built out of that place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people really genuinely care about
each other, taking care of each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's insane to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you can be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, for as much as a coffee a month,
like you can be a part of that and chill
[SPEAKER_03]: and hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically it keeps the trolls out and
it's a really awesome place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know roughly how many people we
have as members on the server?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's about 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least on the discord, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it got up to 900 at one point and
then cleared it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that included the free people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The free people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: They were free.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And occasionally we'll do that again.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll open it up for free.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people can get like an idea of what
goes on in there and see if it's something
[SPEAKER_03]: they're even into, you know, some people
are tentative about discord and chat rooms
[SPEAKER_03]: and interacting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of people that just kind of,
you know, snoop from the background and
[SPEAKER_03]: learn as they go and don't interact much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's totally fine too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then there's people who get up in
the mix and, you know, don't shut up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a great community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be up to, it'll be at least in part
to Shawnee because like either Shawnee is
[SPEAKER_00]: either feeling really good about people
and wants to open it up or he's feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: like a total troll and wants to open it up
so that he can like kick some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see which one you guys are.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel free to come hang out with us anytime
we do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I say, it's not, when I say 24 seven,
I don't mean I'm literally in there 24
[SPEAKER_03]: seven, but it's discord.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we pop in and out all hours of the day,
all of us, not so included, all of us,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, um, so come hang out with us,
chill, sit for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, hopefully you'll enjoy what we
have to, to bring to Breeders Syndicate in
[SPEAKER_03]: the coming months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I just want to reiterate,
like if you missed not, so he is still
[SPEAKER_00]: very much, um, present and engaged and
active on the server.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just not letting him out until we get
10 K.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it just, he's my slave and that's how
it's going to go.
