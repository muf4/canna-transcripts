[SPEAKER_02]: Still says green room.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Breeder Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today we have CSI Humboldt and our
coach, Notso Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope everyone's stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is gonna be a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna be talking today about
breeding goals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Notso, you wanna take it away and run with
the topic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, the last few episodes or
whatever, we've been chatting a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about like breeding history and various
aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked a little bit about terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought maybe it would be better to
chat about something that's not talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about too often, which is like,
what are your goals when you take two
[SPEAKER_00]: things and you cross them together?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you hoping that each parent might
give the children of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then talk a little bit about like sort
of the state of where things are and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's popular and methods and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, that's kind of where
we're gonna bring it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, this is the first time we've
had three people on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little different, super stoked
that our buddy was willing to come on and
[SPEAKER_00]: join us because he is one of the most
prolific breeders that I know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has lots of experience of success,
failures, all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're pretty excited to have him on and
to be able to chat it up about this
[SPEAKER_00]: subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just gonna kind of get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you wanna start at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we could just start at sort of like,
maybe we could just start at breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we'll start with, there's a lot
of people out there today and this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: legitimate thing to do, but I think it's a
little too common maybe where,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, we just lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so hopefully he pops back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of breeding today is people crossing
two things that most people don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you buy that, when you buy
that hybrid, you're hoping to find one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those cuts that you don't have access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that they can consider elite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe a really good example that's like
fairly recent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, somehow Caleb was perfect for the 30
minutes and then within 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got booted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully he'll pop back on in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll talk about like, for instance,
Skittles for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Skittles comes out, Skittles starts
winning a bunch of awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Skittles crew held on to Skittles
pretty tight for a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like at Emerald Cup and some different
other events, people buying hybrids of it
[SPEAKER_00]: was literally the only way that they could
get ahold of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one of the things that
drives breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some instances, something gets famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be Skittles, could be Cookies,
could be Kush, could be any number of
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then most people don't have access to
that cut because maybe it's hoarded or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the circles are still pretty tight
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the pricing and the desirability
for people to buy seeds of that thing
[SPEAKER_00]: become pretty high.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supply and demand, how it always works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supply and demand, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is driven, actually,
a lot of breeding because you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: offering up, hey, you can't get the cut,
but maybe you'll find something in
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles by TK that you'll like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that drives a lot of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of been like one of the
modern ways that people do things is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're mashing together a bunch of famous
cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was certainly the revolution certainly
happened with feminized breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it allowed you to eliminate males for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could take two very famous cuts
and mash them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that sort of started this era of
like, I'm going to take a famous cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to reverse it,
and I'm going to put however many,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 or 20 other famous cuts in the room
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And boom, now I have all these different
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the more modern ways that
people do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a long time ago, and by long,
I mean say 12 or 13 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think Matt can clear this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think 08, 09, that was sort of like
the first era that people started
[SPEAKER_00]: reversing females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be right around that 07,
08.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that some of the first people
to do it would be OG Rascal, Matt himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: CSI, there wasn't very many people doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The technology wasn't very well known at
that point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But previous to 12 years ago or 13 years
ago, everybody used males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the, you used males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll talk a bit about males because
that's sort of where, that was the state
[SPEAKER_00]: of breeding for the longest time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things about males that's a
lot harder than taking two elites that you
[SPEAKER_00]: already know people like, two females that
are already awesome, and crossing them
[SPEAKER_00]: together, is males don't give you nearly
the same level of, what's the best way to
[SPEAKER_00]: describe it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little trait, traits that you
can sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We consume the females, and we only really
use males for a breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So males, what traits they're going to
pass on was a lot more mysterious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what people used to do is let's say
that you have some females that you think
[SPEAKER_00]: are amazing, and you want to cross them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, you would have to cross
it to a male and see what, and grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually grow out the beans and see what
that male gave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes people would take like,
let's say for instance, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might take four or five different
males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross them separately to the same female,
and then grow out each batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two, these two males, I don't like
what they gave to their kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But male three, male three through the
traits that I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times it was pretty laborious
in the sense that you didn't really know
[SPEAKER_00]: which one you wanted to work with until
you started growing their kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's typically how most breeders do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how most breeders have done it
throughout time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So breeding used to be a much more time
consuming process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that regard to find things out,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so that's kind of how
things started, but there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: throw some pollen on your favorite females
and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of things people don't, that people
take for granted when it comes to males
[SPEAKER_02]: first is that there is one, one single
thing that you will use for selection on a
[SPEAKER_02]: male.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I only select males that are sturdy,
you know, or I only select males that have
[SPEAKER_02]: hollow stems because that's going to tell
me it's going to breed the way I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But back in the day, yeah, you had to run
the progeny to see what traits are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be bred for.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, males don't have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A high terpene content like females.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if it did, even if you have a male
that you can smell the terpenes on,
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to
breed that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just an expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just an expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's, you know,
and, and so maybe, maybe we'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll talk about a few really famous lines
just because they're, they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody should know about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what people back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now what's very common is people
mishmash a bunch of famous stuff together
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they sell it and they're hoping
that people will find some nice plants or
[SPEAKER_00]: some elites or some whatever in their
progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most breeding is not done like that in
cannabis and especially in other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most breeding is I have traits from this
line that I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear us?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's smiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, you know, um, most breeding back
in the day, uh, was you would take,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would have two lines and you would
have certain traits from each line that
[SPEAKER_00]: you were hoping to combine into one line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of, that was kind of the
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we'll take something like,
um, like NL five haze cause it's super
[SPEAKER_00]: famous and we chatted about it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there was this haze plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took eight 18 to 24 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't form the greatest buds,
but it had great high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a great, great turf profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a bunch of stuff and they were
trying to figure out how to make it semi
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they picked this NL plant,
which had basically no smell, but had a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of, a lot of crystal and a lot of,
um, you know, a lot of, a lot of resin,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of good structure and it took way,
way, way less time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were trying to blend the flavor
and the effect and the stretchiness of the
[SPEAKER_00]: haze with the resin content, the shorter
flowering time and the bud structure of
[SPEAKER_00]: the NL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mashed them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, another point we
should probably make is that the more
[SPEAKER_00]: traits you're trying to find from each
parent line in the children, the harder it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like talking about this
yesterday, um, it's really, really hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: select for more than one or two traits in
cannabis because it has so many fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: traits, uh, traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't talk about like root.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, one of the main ones we don't talk
about is root expressions, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: different, different root sizes,
different root hairs, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's so many different expressions and
you really can only breed for a few traits
[SPEAKER_02]: in cannabis at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it makes it tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was a, there was a line
that, uh, that Shanti Baba released a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he used to be called peacemaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also called great white shark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's called shark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shark, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, it was, it's skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's skunk by white widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ran through a few hundred of those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found some incredibly potent pot,
but all the potent stuff didn't taste like
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the stuff that was really skunky
didn't get me high very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kept trying to find one that had
both, but I couldn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I still liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept one for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really, really potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it kind of tasted like, it didn't have
bad flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of tasted like, like good
smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, you know, most people,
they don't talk today about like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and maybe Caleb can jump in on
this too, but you know, when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at two different things,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to cross skittles by this,
what do you want each, what are you hoping
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe each parent might give the
seeds, might give the children that you
[SPEAKER_00]: are excited about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what are your goals?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of like the theme of what
we want to talk about today is like
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we lost them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, but I teed him up to start talking
and then he disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, but anyway, so I guess
I'll check more.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just doesn't have video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your video is gone, but you're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: My phone's acting up all kinds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even have a thing that says warning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like you're B.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm thinking that's battery is
overheating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe try audio without the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll try it this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shouldn't be too hard on it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When connections get low, we'll cut the
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you've got some like Humboldt
style eighties connections that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, so maybe, maybe audio, maybe audio.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My connection is actually weak.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear us well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hear and see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just what I was talking about right before
is sort of like when you, when people
[SPEAKER_00]: cross things, what are the ideas and what
are the hopes behind what they're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for to, for each parent to give,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the traits they're looking there
or they're hopeful that the, the parent
[SPEAKER_00]: might give?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so one of the things that,
one of the things that kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think separates, uh, CSI from a lot of
other people is that a lot of people cross
[SPEAKER_00]: things and never test them and they just
release them to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but if you, if you go back on,
uh, on CSI's page, you can go back years
[SPEAKER_00]: and see him running crosses of his own
hybrids for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that does is that actually gives
you an idea, uh, of what the parents
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using throw in their progeny and
how they breed, how they breed,
[SPEAKER_00]: which ones are consistent breeders,
which ones are a mess and are all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's some things out there
that it might be amazing clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that breed like crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they, they don't, they don't
transfer the qualities of the mother cut
[SPEAKER_00]: into its children very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so breeders now, naturally when they
find things that work, they tend to go
[SPEAKER_00]: back to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, most people generally want what I
consider mythical plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want plants that are high yield,
high potency, extremely flavorful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like you were talking about,
you know, they, they want everything in
[SPEAKER_01]: one plant and not only one plant,
but they want all the seeds to be
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not the reality of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like with your kiddles example,
I mean, it, if I'm breeding with skittles,
[SPEAKER_01]: my goal is to take the best
characteristics of skittles, which would
[SPEAKER_01]: be the flavor and the smell and hopefully
incorporate that into something,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, with another desirable characteristic
from the other parent, which would be
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe like yield or potency, you know what
I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's some of the other lines you've
worked with that, that you feel are,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, special for breeding for your
purposes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Say what?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's some of the other lines you've
worked with that you feel have special
[SPEAKER_02]: traits and characteristics that maybe,
maybe they breed true for it that you
[SPEAKER_02]: really enjoy that you've found over the
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I mean, you know, I love the love the
Urkels, the whole family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I love triangle Kush, you know,
OG Kush in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just, you know, a great
building block.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then the chem family, um,
you know, which, you know, most people
[SPEAKER_01]: know, uh, my opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just really chem 91 and
everything past that is a chem hybrid or
[SPEAKER_01]: polyhybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, you know, it's a, it's a delicate
subject, but I think that, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, plants don't lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you've grown a lot of these chem
chem plants for a long time and especially
[SPEAKER_00]: cross them and see what's in them,
uh, it does seem that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, you know, one of the things
that, uh, that came from me, but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think anybody has used it more than,
than, uh, Caleb is, um, the Mendo perps is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably a good example, uh, because the
Mendo perps is it's fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fairly fast finishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got crazy colors in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got very unique turps, uh,
but it's pretty low potency, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, um, one of the,
one of the, you know, one of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that, uh, that he, he released that,
that, you know, got a named cut was this
[SPEAKER_00]: Obama Kush where he married a Mendo P to a
Bubba Kush and the Bubba added a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a bunch of structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It added much more potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Mendo P seemed to add a lot
of pretty color and gave the Bubba some
[SPEAKER_00]: different unique smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's the really good example of like
taking the strengths from one plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing it to something else where those
strengths or weaknesses, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, you know, and then,
you know, there's things that,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's things that interest people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I always recommend people do when
they're breeding, uh, because breeding is
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of work, uh, and it's time consuming
and there's a certain amount of failure
[SPEAKER_00]: involved is if you have goals,
or you're passionate about certain plants
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using, then that to me,
that's the coolest kind of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're like, I want to take
these traits from this plant and I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: see if I can get these traits and these
traits from these two plants into one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, when you're passionate about
something, you know, as, as Caleb just
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, he just rolled through,
you know, favorites and he might be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to explain at length why each one of those
strains, uh, um, you know, why,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's probably a combination
of traits that he likes in each one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also probably a combination of
not only those traits he likes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they pass those traits onto the kids,
you know, pretty consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe you want to, like,
one of the things you've told me in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past, Caleb, is that of a lot of the
things that you use, the Chem 91 seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: be one of the most consistent breeders for
adding potency to its progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, uh, on that one,
I, uh, I also think that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've told you both this, you know,
plenty of times, I have a strong suspicion
[SPEAKER_01]: that I think the Chem 91 itself is an S1
from its original source in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I think that might have something
to do with the, with the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: its propensity to pass on that strength
because it's, it's kind of like a
[SPEAKER_01]: bottlenecked S1 already, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, um, anytime you go,
you know, S1, S2, et cetera, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, things I think are more stable
and easier to pass forward as long as
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not like a recessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, it, it's very consistent in up in
the potency on whatever you cross it to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whether it's, you know,
feminized or regular seeds or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the traits you like about
bubblegum?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's one you use extensively and,
and, uh, your advice, uh, I used it for
[SPEAKER_02]: the bubble berry and super stoked on it,
how it breeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I love the bubblegum cut because
it's one of the best plants I've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: grown out outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just almost mold proof, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's extremely frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a sweet, you know, bubblegum smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's just a nice all around plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, does it, does it compare with
today's, you know, hypey stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably not, but, you know,
for, for, you know, somebody who's farming
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors and, you know, looking for
something, uh, you know, that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, fairly stable and, you know,
uh, mold prone, uh, mold proof,
[SPEAKER_01]: mold proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, the, those are some of
my favorite characteristics of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's one of the things that
we should probably mention too,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that, so if you're really, if you're
passionate about breeding and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to combine certain traits,
I mean, amongst us, you know, we might
[SPEAKER_00]: back and forth, uh, a lot of different
ideas and get excited about a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: random stuff, but there's also this thing
in the back of your mind in, in which,
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to be a successful breeder,
uh, people will have to want to buy your
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and have success with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these practical traits,
uh, like you was just talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, great outdoor plant, highly mold
resistant, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things can be really important,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, uh, people want like,
as Caleb was mentioning earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: people want buy a pack of seeds and that
to be the best growing, best yielding,
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest structure, crazy Terps,
you know, super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want all the beans to be that way,
uh, which is rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if, even if it had that,
but it molded like crazy, people would be
[SPEAKER_00]: pissed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so if, if, if you, if there's
problems inherent in a line, like high
[SPEAKER_00]: mold or hermaphrodism or something else
like that, you can better believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are going to focus on that rather
than this is the most potent flavorful,
[SPEAKER_00]: fastest growing thing I've grown in
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found more bananas and a couple of the
big of the biggest coal is rotted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I think it's a shit cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it, it makes it difficult,
you know, uh, because there's a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of commercial satisfaction that's
required, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes it's the environment that
causes the problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, or, or, you know, I can't,
I can't even imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a, I'm not a public breeder,
uh, but both Matt and Caleb are the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of, you know, the amount of, uh,
responses they get of like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: these seeds didn't pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they died a few days after I cracked
them or they turned out like, like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I blame you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, most of the time, sometimes,
sometimes it is, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the seed maker, but a lot of times it's
breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's user error.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I've never, I've never gotten any
comments like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's always perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's always perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't need to, we don't need to
name names or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's not the point of it,
but there was a super famous line that was
[SPEAKER_00]: released a number of years ago that was
very expensive and very hyped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that made it didn't even
bother to do a germ test and a germ test
[SPEAKER_00]: for people that don't know is if you're a
breeder, you take 50 or a hundred or 200
[SPEAKER_00]: of your seed and you pop them a few times
in paper towels or dirt or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you make sure that there's nothing
funky and they germinate well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's occasionally crosses you
make that don't germ well, forget about
[SPEAKER_00]: them out and seeing issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was, there was a line that
was released that they didn't even do a
[SPEAKER_00]: germ test on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people bought expensive seeds and
then 70% of them didn't even pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was so consistent that it wasn't
really user error because when you start
[SPEAKER_00]: getting just hundreds and hundreds of
complaints about the same issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, the germ test is something that takes,
you know, less than a week to really
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think causes, what do you,
what do you think causes the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: poor germination rates like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, the, I mean,
Matt, you can speak to it if you want,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what's it called?
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the sperm that's in the, uh,
in the shell might not be developed
[SPEAKER_02]: properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wasn't getting proper food.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be minor cracks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all kinds of fucking reasons,
but some of it would probably be what
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are calling it out in the comments
because it was obvious what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was candy rain and I'm not trying to
diss anyone, but one of the things,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the things that I was going to say
is that you can inbreed in cannabis more
[SPEAKER_00]: so than you can in other things a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but when you start inbreeding too much
and your, and your hybrids are a mishmash
[SPEAKER_00]: of the same four or five cuts over and
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over again, you will on occasion start
to get undesirable recessives or
[SPEAKER_00]: undesirable traits that pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those traits could be like some
mutant funky seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, yeah, but you know,
Caleb can talk about it too, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because he does a lot of S ones and he's
even done some S twos, but as you start
[SPEAKER_00]: going to S three, S four, S five things
start getting significantly more
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants start getting way weaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: The germination rates become a lot
tougher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there's a real limit there,
uh, you know, in, in how far you can
[SPEAKER_00]: inbreed before you start to hit problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I haven't inbred that deep,
but, uh, Caleb, Caleb has a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more than I have in terms of
experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, uh, yeah, there's,
there's issues with inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can combine undesirable traits and
have them become a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even, even in S twos, uh, there's a lot of
plants that will not produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they won't, yeah, they won't
move forward when reversed, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, reversals, reversals
have become sort of the norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's flipped in this, in the sixties,
seventies, eighties, nineties,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the first decade of the two thousands,
uh, the, all breeding for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, was, was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we call regular breeding using males
and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, the only feminized breeding
that happened was typically accidental,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, hermaphrodism or something
along those lines, bag seeds, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, and then the revolution
happened, uh, you know, 13, 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 years ago, where the technology on how
to reverse cannabis became more well
[SPEAKER_00]: known.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I would say it's flipped and the
percentage of people that uses actual
[SPEAKER_00]: males is extremely low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vast majority of the seed game
today is feminized in some way,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's a really, it's a really
valuable tool, but as both of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, my co-hosts today can express,
uh, you know, we were joking before we
[SPEAKER_00]: came on live is that, you know,
when I use traditional males in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: my breeding, I never had a single breeding
failure where when you reverse things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can have failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have not very much pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have sterile pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have the pollen sacks not open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to go through a lot of manual
labor to extract using screens and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen from the pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, in the old days,
you have one male in a room, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: guaranteed you're going to pollinate the
entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and today we're in today's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, Caleb was just chatting
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might use 10 or 12, uh, females that
are marked for reversal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the hopes that a few of them are,
you know, dump a lot and some,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of them dump some, and a few dump
a little, and then you've got a few
[SPEAKER_00]: failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so it's, it's, uh, it's pretty
difficult because it's not consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, people have great success
reversing a plant once and they do the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for whatever reason, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, uh, the, the, you know,
we have a lot of theories as to why,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, is the mix too strong or too weak?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a range of, of the mix that leads
to, you know, pollen dumping with some
[SPEAKER_00]: strains versus others, but it's mostly
like observational because we'd all don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have labs to really analyze why the
failure went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and, uh, you know,
it also leads to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in some cases, uh, you know,
people get mad at hermaphrodism,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's some plants that don't herm
and therefore they're a bitch to reverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like I was telling you guys,
uh, you know, just, just a couple of days
[SPEAKER_01]: ago, I had to chop down a whole room at
four weeks flower because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I reversed eight, you know, nice big
bushes of old Betsy and none of them
[SPEAKER_01]: produced any pollen whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way I do things, I, I don't really
have a fallback a lot of the times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if it fails, I just have to chop a
whole room down and start over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the price of doing
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it old Betsy not reversing kind of
made me sad because she's one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite old girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so, you know, there's some,
there's some lines, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of
people, uh, that have tried to reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: various diesel and sour cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're notorious for not giving you
commercial viable amounts of pollen to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a bunch of people have had been
having really great results with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb's TK crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, Caleb can speak to this,
but I think he failed two or three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when he did even have success,
it was probably like a fifth of the
[SPEAKER_00]: success that he would normally have.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a good reversal.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, so there's, there's a lot of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's, there's, there's failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of, a lot of breeding failure used
to be you breed something and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny, the children don't give you what
you were hoping for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in feminized breeding, there's a lot
of actual failure to fertilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that goes on even by extremely
experienced people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That do it all the time and for a living
and have real good techniques down and
[SPEAKER_00]: have done it a bunch and had a lot of
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'd like to add to though,
um, that when breeding feminized,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you tend to have a better idea of,
and in general kind of more consistent,
[SPEAKER_01]: better results with your feminized,
you know, progeny than like a normal,
[SPEAKER_01]: a normal breeding where, you know,
you can observe certain things about a
[SPEAKER_01]: male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really can't see what it's going to
pass forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with the fems, you, you know,
your girl on the left, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: your girl on the right, you know,
it does tend to kind of give you a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit better of a idea of what you're going
to get, you know, on that F1 hybrid,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, so like, if you were to talk
to breeders, say that we've been talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, you know, in the last few podcasts,
in the eighties and touch on the nineties
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff, I think most of them would tell
you that the most important, the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important plants they had in their rooms,
uh, were the consistent males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like once you found a consistent male back
then, you tended to cross it to everything
[SPEAKER_00]: because you were so stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a recent example would be,
you know, uh, Matt found a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: blue bonnet male.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was really happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was really happy with the,
with the traits that it passed onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and because males are so much harder
to find ones that pass the traits you
[SPEAKER_00]: want, they tend to get used over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to move on sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets really hard to move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, you have, you can look
at some of these old seed banks,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, Neville stuff or some
stuff in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they have a, they have a
handful of males, um, really a handful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they use those handful of males with
everything, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, failure, you know,
failure and means that like you get
[SPEAKER_00]: something that the customer doesn't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just ends up being a big Ziploc
in your fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, or you, you test
something out and you feel like it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: too many herms and it might affect your
reputation, even though you think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: good weed and you don't want to deal with
all the complaints out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ends up being a big Ziploc in your
fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe it'll be a project you
want to use later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, uh, one of the big
aspects of this that we want to chat about
[SPEAKER_00]: is that, you know, the term breeder is
used loosely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and this isn't a disney one,
but it encompasses basically anybody that
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to cross and make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's some people,
um, you know, there's not very many of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, uh, but both uh, Caleb and Matt are
two of them that they are actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: they actually do what I consider to be
traditional breeding in the sense that
[SPEAKER_00]: they take plants that they found from
previous breedings and they use them in
[SPEAKER_00]: further work, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot, there's a, you know,
and everybody listening right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can have the power to affect breeding,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the breeding game right now is
crossing a lot of hybrids together and
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing them to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: With absolutely no work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of breeders are crossing famous
things to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're giving them a sexy name and some
good packaging and they're releasing them
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're not actually popping them
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not doing any further work,
which is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then what happens is, is that when you
take somebody like, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb who runs a bunch of his own work,
he gets to see what varieties in my
[SPEAKER_00]: collection breed well and which ones
don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which ones throw traits that I like and
which ones are all over the place and
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that knowledge informs the next steps
you want to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so for instance, um,
you know, uh, Caleb has a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, they call T 1000, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, which is, uh, you know, it's,
it's a named cut from, uh, from one of his
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's Urkel and TK, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triangle Kush times purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triangle Kush times purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he found, you know, it was found in
hunts of that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I, I saw on his Instagram
and he's told me and stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's reversed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's taken that cut and he's used it in
further work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of my, that was my,
one of my buddy, Tigard farm selection,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, from, you know, up there in Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, sometimes, sometimes it's
stuff you find in your own work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's stuff your buddies find in
your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, he, Caleb liked that one
enough that he's now doing further work
[SPEAKER_00]: within his own lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the most effective and the cheapest
and the most profitable way to grow seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, sadly, is to make the cross,
give it a name, give it some cool
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging and sell it and never do any
further work yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's a pretty profitable path.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other path, which is you test and you
grow rooms full of your own stuff and you
[SPEAKER_00]: try to look for traits amongst that stuff
that you want to keep working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's a lot more sustainable
breeding, uh, because it gives you the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to, you know, uh, do multi-stage
breeding, which is real, what real
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding is really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's time consuming and it's
costly and it takes a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to have a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to have a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and in that regard, and so,
you know, I don't know if he's,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I don't know if you're,
are you selling, you're probably selling
[SPEAKER_00]: the T 1000 hybrids now, aren't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made them a while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, he's got, you know,
how many breeders out there are doing two
[SPEAKER_00]: or three or four step processes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's real breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at dog breeders or you look at
fish breeders or you look at corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, the idea that you just make
hybrids and sell them and never try to
[SPEAKER_00]: like advance in any way is not normal in
breeding.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my favorite projects, you know,
that I'm working on now, um, are the S two
[SPEAKER_01]: projects where, you know, I've,
you know, grown out a hundred plus,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, plants of, you know,
at my S ones and made selections from
[SPEAKER_01]: those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm doing, I'm doing S twos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm doing back crosses to the moms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making hybrids between, you know,
S twos of the various, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, S ones like, you know,
taking the Oracle S one cross it to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, triangle coach or chem dog S one
and, you know, kind of making new versions
[SPEAKER_01]: of those same hybrids that I did with the
original parent cuts, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to be unique and hopefully a
lot more, you know, stable and uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, versus the previous generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of work, you know,
going into all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: New shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we could, you know, maybe one thing
we could talk about and these are,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are also observations from Caleb,
but he's ran out a bunch of, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uh, chem 91 S ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we all think that it
already is an S one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what leads us to think that is the
lack of variability in the line,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It passes potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It passes looks that look very similar to
it, or there's a small range in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you kind of, you kind of get what
you get with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then he's also done a thing and I got
to go up and see it where he's reversed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Mendo P and he's grown out a
bunch of Mendo P S ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that has so much diversity in it
that, you know, he's made comments to me
[SPEAKER_00]: in the past where you could give out seeds
S ones of Mendo perps to various different
[SPEAKER_00]: people and they could make their own
selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lines would be extremely different
from one another because there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so much variation in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, you know, and then maybe we
should make a comment about S ones because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so many clone only elites and
there's not, um, there's not lines
[SPEAKER_00]: available of many of these things anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, most of the stuff that we hold,
uh, in our collections, you only have one
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting of that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have any sisters of it and you
don't have any boys of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have any way to look within the
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the benefits, um,
of doing S ones with that kind of thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really the only way to look within
the genetic without another genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, genes coming in there and
altering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, so that's why we didn't
know how narrow the chem 91 gene pool was
[SPEAKER_00]: until he S one did and grew out a few
hundred of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that it was narrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know how wide Mendo purple was
until you did that and grew out a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you were like, Oh my God,
there's a different stuff in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so S ones, S ones give people,
selfing gives people an ability to look
[SPEAKER_00]: through a line when they only have one
example, one female example of the line
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so it's one of the ways that
modern breeders get to save and preserve
[SPEAKER_00]: old lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, a lot of famous stuff that Caleb
has run recently, like Mendo purple or,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, snow or Trinity or chem 91 or,
you know, Urkel, or you go down the list
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you don't S one it, it's really
hard to see what's in it by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can out-cross it to other things and
you can see what traits that are dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: that pass to the children and out-crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you really want to look within a
line, um, most seed lines today,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, most clone onlys are that
they're clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of these cuts, we'll start to
interrupt all of these for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: selfing, you know, they're, they're all
cuts that are, you know, as you well know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Mendo purposes over,
you know, you sprouted that seed over 20
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and a lot of these cuts are 30,
40 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we don't, you know, stash away some
S one seed in that fridge, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: before it was too late, before those cuts,
you know, disappear, uh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll lose those genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: On that tangent, are you going to redo
the, the, the old Betsy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to make another attempt at
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see real old bull rider stock
pulled out of those S ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: My, my, my problem is, is I don't,
I have, I only have rooms that are three,
[SPEAKER_01]: four and six.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, um, it's hard doing some of
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had like some single light rooms
to do these things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, cause then it wouldn't be so
much of an expense to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time, every time it fails.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might be, that might be something
good to talk about is that it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing how much cool stuff we have to
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: These days considering like most,
most normal breeders from other walks of
[SPEAKER_00]: life would laugh at the limited selection
pool we pull from, uh, how many plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many plants we get to run to make the
next generation selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, prohibition and things
like that have made a lot of breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: happen, especially in America inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inside means you have electricity,
you have a lot of lights, you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most breeders have a million ideas
in their head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the ones that are passionate about it
and their ability to realize those ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: is quite limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, you, you might have a
fridge full of, of ideas and passion
[SPEAKER_00]: projects and whatever, but most breeders,
you know, you have to sell enough stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: while you're doing your passion to fund
the passion part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, you know, when I was
doing a lot of breeding in the late
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties and early two thousands,
it was a terrible financial decision,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, because I wasn't selling any seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just giving it away to friends and
it was just for my personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then cannabis was super
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at least other people made money off
your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but whatever, but that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just a matter of, it's just a
matter of like most people back then
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't willing to take a four lighter
when you could get, you know, when weed
[SPEAKER_00]: was 4,500 a pound or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of getting six or eight pounds
of sellable cannabis out of that four
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter to get thousands of seeds that
you, you know, uh, you know, didn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: have an outlet for, um, you know,
and that's another thing that we should
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about too, for a second is the fact
that most seed breeding in America did not
[SPEAKER_00]: have an American outlet to be able to get
it to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot of private breeding
going on and there was a lot of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there was some passion going on
and different things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the public's asset access to it was
tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nineties and the, and the early
two thousands, which is when I did most of
[SPEAKER_00]: my stuff, I don't think there was
American, small American seed companies
[SPEAKER_00]: that were getting it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would, you would have to make them
here, send them over to Europe and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they would have to send them back to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was companies like there was
companies, that's why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like certain Americans partnered with
Europeans do worst decisions I ever made
[SPEAKER_00]: in my life over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, lots of American breeders think
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, I mean, for instance,
in the nineties, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the blueberry stuff, DJ short,
you know, he partnered with sag Martha
[SPEAKER_00]: first and then Dutch passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't sound like he was very
pleased with either one of those things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, you know, it, uh, it at least
allowed, if you didn't partner with
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody in Europe, nobody had access to
your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The forums changed it a little bit because
it at least allowed private DMS and some,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some low level trading and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even like, yeah, even Matt,
back in the day, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you, you would have a web address that had
the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll comment on that real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, I get this question all
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only reason that I have a dot NL
address, it wasn't because I was going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get more traffic because of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously nobody types anything dot NL.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you live in the U S.
[SPEAKER_02]: But back then it was just a, just one more
step to keep people from looking at me in
[SPEAKER_02]: the U S and, and nowadays it's,
it's irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's funny when people still Americans
use dot NL cause they think it's some kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of special thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but really, you know, the,
the IG era and you know, the forum,
[SPEAKER_00]: the forums a little bit, and then
Instagram and then loosening laws and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allowed a lot of very small time
private breeders to be able to,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, to get out there, you know,
um, and there was some people back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day, 20 years ago, uh, when, you know,
when Caleb and Shaw and some others and I
[SPEAKER_00]: first met, um, at some harvest parties and
such, you know, the people that were
[SPEAKER_00]: internet famous back then were like Vic
high and, uh, DJ short and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, uh, the, you know, the brothers Grimm
and the C 99 work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they, well, they got famous
because there was, there was such a,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was such a limited pool,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like it, you know, there was some,
there was a few Canadians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was a few Americans,
it got famous on the forums, but there
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't now it's like anybody can,
you know, can breed seeds in their closet
[SPEAKER_00]: or a bedroom or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can have an IG handle and they
can get their work out there and they can
[SPEAKER_00]: spread their work to friends and they can
so test grows and people can see pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now it's become, it's become a lot
more common.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 20 years ago, um, you know,
uh, the vast majority of breeders I knew
[SPEAKER_00]: in Mendo and Humboldt and stuff were
private.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had, unless you met them, you had no
way of getting access to any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like zero, you know, if you were in North
Carolina or Illinois or Colorado or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, like you weren't
going to meet the people in the triangle
[SPEAKER_00]: or the people in Santa Cruz or the people
wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so I, you know, the combination of
reversals and the combination of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Instagram and some other forms
of communication really exploded.
[SPEAKER_00]: The small seed breeder in a way that it
never happened before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know that, you know,
people would even know who CSI or riot
[SPEAKER_00]: would be without those two innovations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still don't know who riot is,
but it's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, we're, we're about,
let's see for, uh, 50 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to start doing some
questions that are, uh, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you want to start answering any,
Caleb, we could do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you want to talk any more on the
breeding topic, we could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm okay with whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can tell you, dude, that,
uh, uh, questions for you predominate the
[SPEAKER_00]: questions this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll try to do every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, to be honest, yeah, even, even the
weeks that you're not here, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a bunch of stuff that people want
to, for us to ask because they know you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so maybe, uh, you know, let's see,
let's talk about, um, here's a,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's a basic one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your very first cut and what,
what, what is one of the cuts that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could say you hold closest to your heart
amongst your current collection?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my very first cut, um, was a
Northern lights from my dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, he, he gave, he gave me that cut
in, in, uh, in 94.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I had that one all the way up
until I think 2002 and then stupidly lost
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, the, the, the closest thing
to that anymore is like chem number,
[SPEAKER_01]: chem dog number four, you know,
that stuff is very similar to the old
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern lights I got from my dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as far as favorites go, I always talk
about it, you know, just, just in case
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody has ever come across it,
but you know, my dad also gave me a,
[SPEAKER_01]: around the same era, this Uriah cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, that one is still one of my
favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it might be possible to
recreate something like it was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: say a pine tar Kush, a bit of OG Kush,
and maybe something super, super just
[SPEAKER_01]: piney lemony, blah, blah, blah,
even more so than OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, as far as what I have,
uh, still, I mean, I love, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the purple Indica that,
you know, my, my good buddy Fletch,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, got in the early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty sure that cut dates back to
the eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, up there, up there in
Portland and Washington and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that one's, that one's extremely
unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, uh, you know, you're,
you know, I'm a fan of the purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I absolutely, you know, love Francis's
Mendo purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, um, and then, uh, you know,
uh, you know, I've, I've had Urkel for
[SPEAKER_01]: damn near 20 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, she, she, she's,
she's a tried and true favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I lost any of those three,
I'd be a little bit upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's super simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, can you please confirm the timeline
for super skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was released by Neville in the
final year that he owned the seed bank
[SPEAKER_00]: outright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so super skunk was released to the
public in the 1990, the seed bank catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he took a maple leaf Indica,
uh, which is supposedly called Afghan T
[SPEAKER_00]: and he crossed that to one of,
uh, Sam skunk man's skunk lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that put the funk back in the
skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it became a, it had a,
it had a great name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a great look, uh, became super
popular in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so super skunk was, uh, when people
talk about, Oh, I had, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: mid eighties super skunk or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that there wasn't skunk
aromas out there, but the actual super
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk name came about in the 1990,
uh, uh, seed bank catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this one is for Caleb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, do you feel that males have a place in
modern cannabis breeding or reversals the
[SPEAKER_00]: future and why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I absolutely do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm, I've never been one of those
types to rule out anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a place for feminized
seeds and, you know, feminized breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's just a value as
valuable a place for regular breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, I, I, I started out
doing just as much regular work as
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't really capitalize on
selling, you know, much of the regular
[SPEAKER_01]: work because it kind of just took an aside
because you got to select out all those
[SPEAKER_01]: damn males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, the next question, I'm not
actually not going to have Caleb answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to make a joke about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's nothing against the,
it's a great question, but could Caleb
[SPEAKER_00]: please talk about interesting things he
learned from any or every line he's
[SPEAKER_00]: selfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to wait for
Caleb's 10, 10 volume, uh, Oath of Opus on
[SPEAKER_00]: every line he's selfed because,
uh, he's constantly, uh, selfing things
[SPEAKER_00]: over the last 10 years or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's such a, that's a, that's,
uh, we could just talk for hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's just dozens of cuts that he's
done that to at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little too wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a good question, but boy,
it really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A novel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I will say, I will say I take,
uh, pictures, um, and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they help with mental notes on more or
less every single S one I grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I think I'm headed up to about 2
million pictures strong as far as,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the, the S one has one pictures
are going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll ask this one again because it got a
lot of votes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to try or continue to try to
reverse the Irene Kush?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you get, when you get 20 S
one seeds from half a half of a light,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, that's a little rattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and also, I don't know if people
know, but, um, the, the Irene,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for half, half a thousand watt
light produced 20 seeds, but the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the triangle Kush, uh, that got the
side pollination from that in the bed next
[SPEAKER_01]: to it produced like 750 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the pollen was viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't pollinate itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and that's an interesting statement
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, um, even when people get viable
pollen, uh, there's some cuts out,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some cuts out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mac would be one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's some others that Matt could
talk about that you have viable pollen and
[SPEAKER_00]: it pollinates everything around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't pollinate that female plant
very well at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plants that have very few pistols
on them and the pistols don't seem to be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a very good job of transferring
that, that pollen grain to, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it needs to go to fertilize the egg
and create a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there's some interesting stuff in
that, uh, this is another really good
[SPEAKER_00]: question for Caleb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, uh, it's pretty valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested to hear inspect to speak on
growing large populations in relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: small spaces.
Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, ideally I like to do no more than
36 plants per light when I'm growing large
[SPEAKER_01]: populations of like feminized seeds out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'll do that in a four to
six K room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'm, I'm doing a hundred to
200 plants generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it just, it just gives you a better,
a better idea of, you know, what's in that
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have done like single light,
you know, rooms where I pack in like 80
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, you know, under the one light and
I flower them out, you know, at,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, four or six inches tall,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I mean, you know, for,
for anybody limited on space, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's an excellent way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, especially if you're doing them in
like small six inch pots where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you can make selections out of
that larger pool, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, then you can pull them out and,
you know, um, you know, re-veg them and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, actually have, you know,
have fairly heavily selected stock to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you don't have to grow your
plants out in a five gallon pot or 10
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon pot or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to grow them big to know
what you want, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you're looking for potency,
uh, smell, flavor, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: any of the, the really main criteria,
you don't need just big plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you're looking for structure or
hemp, maybe you need a little more room,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll, I'll add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll add to that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Caleb has a little bit different style
than I do in the, in that he grows,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, small seed plants like that,
fairly tightly packed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just so people know when he's talking
about doing 36 plants a light,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that generally it's, it's on like a,
a slight, you know, one of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, old tables, like a four and a half by
four and a half kind of area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a six, it's kind of a six
wide, you know, six deep type of scenario
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're, I used to do it slightly
differently than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would, I would grow out a bunch of
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take cuttings from that seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, as soon as multiple cuttings had
rooted, I would ditch the seed itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I found when you were growing
regular stuff, the seed energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to know what it did as a
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to know what it did as a clone,
because sometimes that can be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to see its growth structure
as a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and what he mentioned is, is that when
you grow up things too big and you flower
[SPEAKER_00]: them and all of a sudden you get 10 or 12
pounds or something and you have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: booths, uh, or at, or average,
not every, not everything is, is a,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a home run, you know, even amongst
lines that produce great plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a lot of, you know,
and so then you end up with a lot of ants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would do is somewhat similar to
him in that I would throw away the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and then I would pack tables with,
you know, four to six inch tall cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would flower the cut because as
Caleb just mentioned, if I got a half
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce or three quarters of an ounce or an
ounce off a plant and I got to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: the cola looked like there, that's all I
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, and you, you, you would get
enough of the turps, you'd get enough of
[SPEAKER_00]: the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could, you know, if you have a
quarter, seven to 10 grams to smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll give you enough indication that
you need to, um, that you can go back and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow some of those selections,
uh, in a, in a larger, in a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario, grow more of them, grow them
bigger, see their, see their, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that way, if you get a bunch of
bunk, it's only five to 14 grams a bunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Per per plant, you know, and you get
enough and that's what you need to start
[SPEAKER_00]: doing in order to really run through
numbers, uh, in, in that regard and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and have it only take up so much space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other issue that happens and,
you know, I have a different method than
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb, but it's a universal problem is
when you start growing out large numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: to test and you don't want to lose
something, you end up needing to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: backups of the things you're flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't lose them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's basically two methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either keep backups, which is time
consuming and takes up a bunch of space in
[SPEAKER_00]: your veg, or you can start pulling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow in pots, you could start
pulling out small pots of things that you
[SPEAKER_00]: think are amazing when they're only part
of the way through flowering and then
[SPEAKER_00]: revert.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a European method and kind
of, and start reverting them back to veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, but you know,
it's, you know, it's a real issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, because you know, it's happened to
Caleb talks to me about it all the time is
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, uh, you know, I grew a
room of 240 plants and my two and my three
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites, two of the cuttings didn't make
it by the time I realized it was my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so trying to save copies
that you can go back and actually deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with and the space involved is a real pain
in the ass for lack of a better way to put
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it takes up, you know, you want to do
a big hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to keep that thing around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you got a big bench.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I fully agree with not so on,
uh, taking cuts off of the seed plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: growing the, the cut, the cuttings versus
the seed plants, because seed plants will
[SPEAKER_01]: never give you an accurate representation
of what that clone is going to become past
[SPEAKER_01]: the seed stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's really, I fully agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason to grow the seed plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's themselves when you're just
selecting for future, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, clone stock that's going to give
you the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have a tap root.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be lankier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have some more life energy in
different ways in them than the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since you only get one shot at the
seed, that's why a lot of people like back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the day would want to grow seed outdoor
because the vigor contained within a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: plant would give you, could give you a lot
larger plant, a bigger plant than a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's some famous clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my Maui cut does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue dream does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, green crack does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some famous clones that despite
being clones will give you huge plants
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you went back to the two 15 era,
five or six years ago, a lot of the big
[SPEAKER_00]: giant gardens you would see on Instagram,
uh, in terms of outdoor, we're all seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got an eight or nine foot tall
room with, you know, a thousand watt
[SPEAKER_00]: lights or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden you've got some seed
energy and the thing wants to be seven
[SPEAKER_00]: feet tall and you're doing bending and
trellising and corralling of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a huge pain in the ass,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's the, you know,
Caleb actually has had a pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: method of taking clones off of plants when
they're a couple of weeks into bloom,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, which a lot of people wouldn't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but in that regard, it, it,
it, they, the plants kind of freak out for
[SPEAKER_00]: a while because they're into flower,
but that's actually a benefit because one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the things you're trying to do when
you're keeping clones in a different room
[SPEAKER_00]: for veg is you want to keep them kind of
small until you figure out which ones are
[SPEAKER_00]: worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there might, you might have 180
clones and like, you only care about six
[SPEAKER_00]: of them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know which six.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they're, when they're in flower,
it takes a good month, maybe even six
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before they start vegging out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you buy yourself some time keeping them
in those flats.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, we actually just took, uh, uh,
12 flats of clones this week of,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, TK ABC F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yippee skippee to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I should mention just
because Caleb's told me about it a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: is that when you start judging plants on
growth and structure and weight and frost
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that, those are good things to
judge on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of the times, uh, he finds out
his favorites end up being some shitty ass
[SPEAKER_00]: run, uh, that wasn't very impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't look very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't very happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never thought much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, him and his crew end
up testing it, which is actually the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the part that matters at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, Oh man, this is special,
but you never would have thought it was
[SPEAKER_00]: special growing because it just looked
like a, it just looked like a run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like it was odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had funkiness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have the greatest bud structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course that's going to be like
the tastiest one with the best topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a huge fan of runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, you know, I would say too,
that we could mention this because,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, he laughed about it,
but really if you look at like Caleb's
[SPEAKER_00]: work with freak show, or you look at the
ABC or you look at, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: runs, and things like that, like what he's
really talking about is like, he's a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: fan of outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a huge fan of things that are
abnormal, things that pop up in a
[SPEAKER_00]: population that might be rare,
things that, you know, uh, might not be
[SPEAKER_00]: that common, but then it popped up and
you're like, Oh, look at that little
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what direction could I take
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And strangely, you know, we should mention
this too, is that, so I'll, I'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stretch it out a little bit,
but if you go into the store, any
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable you buy in the store,
whether it's a tomato or a zucchini or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever else, that thing has been picked
to grow because it yields well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for instance, let's take a tomato,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important thing for a tomato for
tomato growers is weight color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the skin break?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it rot in transit?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all these, can you stack it in
transit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it bruise easily?
[SPEAKER_00]: All these factors are huge taste and
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And texture are way down on the list,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole reason why heirloom tomatoes
made a comeback is because these things
[SPEAKER_00]: actually taste good where when people were
growing things for production,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, zucchini, anything you name it,
they're grown because the producer,
[SPEAKER_00]: it, it grows well for them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces a lot for the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is pretty unique in that the
stuff that becomes really popular became
[SPEAKER_00]: really popular because consumers enjoyed
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one would ever in a million years pick
any kind of OG Kush as a production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viny, small buds doesn't hold itself up a
pain in the ass to grow a weak root
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those things would prevent you from
ever seeing it in most normal agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: because they would eliminate it because it
didn't have the qualities needed to be put
[SPEAKER_00]: to scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would want every, you'd get blue
dream, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a fast growing, vigorous
thing that yields a ton, doesn't take that
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so cannabis is a bit unique in that
even like something like sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, sour diesel is kind of tricky to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of people find it finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have too many bud sites on sour
diesel, it'll give you a lot of feathery
[SPEAKER_00]: almost weed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, there's a lot that goes on
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of very famous strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That have really, really crappy production
traits, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The pump, you know, all kinds of things,
you know, um, you know, and so,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so there's the, you know,
Matt way earlier in the thing was talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about root structure, which is not a very
bread for trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's certain plants that you grow
in the same room that some plants drink
[SPEAKER_00]: like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll use OG Kush as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of OG Kushes have typically weak
root systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't grow vigorous root systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, they can only drink so
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, they only grow so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's a consideration too,
is that cannabis has been, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you guys a funny story really
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Skittles first came out, uh,
Skittles is notorious for growing slow,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Caleb and I had had a mutual friend
that made an IG post where he was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in, in October, he's like,
I'm edging these Skittles for my next
[SPEAKER_00]: year's light depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they'll be three, hopefully
they'll be three feet tall in six months,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where Skittles might be like winning
awards for its turps and winning awards
[SPEAKER_00]: for its extracts and everything else,
but try to get the thing higher than four
[SPEAKER_00]: feet tall outside.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a slow growing bushy little hedge of
a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my point to that is that most of
the famous strains that people like either
[SPEAKER_00]: for their turf profile or their high,
wouldn't make the cut in normal
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture because they don't have the
growth traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really, really difficult because
that's what I was, that's what made me
[SPEAKER_00]: think of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was joking about Caleb's love for
runs is that a lot of times the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the freak, the mutant, the one that grew
short, the one that was a pain in the ass
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the one that tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that will get people
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one that was like five feet tall
and three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one that grew huge colas all over
it and grew like a champ and barely
[SPEAKER_00]: required any work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one ends up being a little bit more
boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, man, I wish I could merge
those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about that for a minute, Caleb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear the biggest, biggest girls,
at least biggest feminized girls I grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always seem to have a little
persuasion to hang in the balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've noticed that,
but the big girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Women say that about me all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a question for both of you that,
that I'll follow up with on after,
[SPEAKER_02]: after ask you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Hayes brothers and me and Caleb
actually talked about this yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think me and me and not so talked
about it a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know crybaby was a part of that Hayes
brothers, vintage California Kush 1980s
[SPEAKER_02]: picture in high times in the 79 issued,
they talk of a new hybrid known as CUSH
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush in NorCal across between Hawaiian
hash plant and Thai specifically calling
[SPEAKER_02]: it Kush by 79.
[SPEAKER_02]: They already knew of Hindu.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what the fuck is this Cali Kush?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it pure Kush?
[SPEAKER_02]: The picture does look like the Malibu in
the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: They straight up say Afghani skunk weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been driving me crazy for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caleb, anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can make a couple of general
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kush is a general term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a huge mountain range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the second tallest mountain range in
the world next to the Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it runs through Afghanistan and
Pakistan down to the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's called the Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we talked in a previous
podcast about how names are relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back in the day, people talked about
people named things per their region of
[SPEAKER_00]: origin, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wahakan, Michoacan, Panamanian,
Hawaiian, you know, various, various
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They rarely had names that weren't
regional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kush could literally be anything
collected from the Hindu Kush mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Hindu Kush mountains could be as
low as one or two thousand feet above sea
[SPEAKER_00]: level and as high as five, six,
seven, eight thousand above sea level in
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these big valleys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and then secondly to that
and what people what he's probably really
[SPEAKER_00]: asking is that there are there are a few
plants that popped up and became famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody mostly knows the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they don't, there's a there's a
Bubba Kush line and there's a Kush line
[SPEAKER_00]: that has various origin stories,
but is most likely a mix of northern
[SPEAKER_00]: California and European genetics that
popped up in Florida, came to L.A.,
[SPEAKER_00]: became a craze.
[SPEAKER_00]: People got extreme amounts of money for it
and then it became very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what most people today know is
Kush, you could classify as TK or ghost or
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what most people know, because
that's what became popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's been traded on forums and
traded on IG and everybody else and bought
[SPEAKER_00]: in clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what most people today know
of as Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a lot narrower of a gene pool
than shit that came from the Hindu Kush.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go all the way back to Hindu.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go back all the way back to 1979 and
you have Matt and I might do a short about
[SPEAKER_00]: this soon about the hippie hashish trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have some you have some euros or
you have some Americans come back from
[SPEAKER_00]: India Nepal, Kashmir, you know,
Pakistan or Afghanistan, and they bring
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds back to their buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're from Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what what date was was the article from
again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seventy nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seventy nine issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: They talked of a new hybrid known as Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, remember I was telling you
how they were hating on Humboldt back back
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was I think it was that same
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all bitter, you know,
that Humboldt's all popular because of
[SPEAKER_01]: their Indica's or their Kush's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they were upset that their
hazes, you know, were getting downplayed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, like we've talked plenty
of times back in 78, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was that was roughly the year that
pretty much it seems like everybody around
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt, you know, Trinity, all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had, you know, we're growing purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a huge influx, you know,
of purple Kush seed, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and obviously just like not so was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's just Hindu Kush seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the purple, of course, the purple
phenome or purple genotype of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm almost wondering if they didn't
just get a hold of some some of that seed
[SPEAKER_01]: and incorporate it into their hazes to
kind of you know, up their market value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is very possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I could add to that is that
in modern breeding today, that same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: holds true, which is a cut becomes famous
and everybody breeds that cut into
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the last 15 years, the amount of
people that have used cherry pie,
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl Scout cookies, five or eight
different Kush cuts, Skittles,
[SPEAKER_00]: South, you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it became famous and desirable,
people would blend it into everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things you know,
you see people out there that are like
[SPEAKER_00]: pumping up their various hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, some of the stuff you see
Caleb do that people might be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, why the hell is he working with ABC?
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freak show is fucked up, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why the fuck are you messing around with
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it is like, honestly, with the
amount of work that's been done with
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry pie and cookies and Kush,
what new and exciting do you think is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to pop out of that that someone
hasn't already done in the last 10 years?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you take two hybrids that are
mostly a mishmash of those things all
[SPEAKER_00]: smashed up together, I'm not dissing
crossing Kush mints with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are you going to find that's not
something that's already somewhat similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to a lot that's out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to find novel and new and
so so people people have been ever ever
[SPEAKER_00]: since the name game came around and ever
since popularity came around, like Caleb
[SPEAKER_00]: was just mentioning, people might be
crossing these Afghans to their hazes to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase its popularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been doing that for the last
forever, but it's increased dramatically
[SPEAKER_00]: in the last 20 years, where it's like,
you know, there was a I mean, this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: funny example, but there's no Kush in
Blackberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sense that Kush, for the most part,
like the reason why people added Kush to
[SPEAKER_00]: Blackberry Kush was because people wanted
to buy Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sour gets added to a lot of
names or diesel gets added to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: names or names get changed because there's
a desire to sell certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the desire to feed that market
either makes a lot of breeding happen
[SPEAKER_00]: around a few select cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're trying to get a hybrid that you
can call, you know, there's a famous
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a there's a good cut up here
called Doc's OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that it's it's not the
greatest cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have very much OG flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have very much in the way of,
you know, the the the high that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it looks like a traditional Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it yields like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then people are going to grow it
because it produces well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can call it Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm looking for Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, I have a ton of Kush here by
this Doc's Kush.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, and I'm not even trying
to diss them or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is that is that, you know,
these names get added onto things because
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as it's desirable and easy to buy,
for instance, you know, Caleb has become
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty famous with his Urkel crosses in
0405 0606.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0707 I would say that, you know,
eventually there was probably literally
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of growers in Mendo and Humboldt
that had lavender, Urkel, grape ape,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half a dozen of these different cuts to
meet the purple craze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the purple craze phased into
the sour craze and the Kush craze and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cookie craze and the Skittles craze,
it ends up like there's like six dudes
[SPEAKER_00]: that held on to the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 15 years ago, how many people did you
know in Humboldt that had some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody because it was everybody because
it was popular and a lot of buyers wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: it, which means lots of people that
produced had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as the market shifted,
so did the holding of the cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before that, before that, it was
Salmon Creek, Big Bud and train wreck and
[SPEAKER_01]: snow and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what happens is and this is sort
of the thing is that when things are
[SPEAKER_00]: popular, everybody has it and everybody
wants it and people want it from their
[SPEAKER_00]: friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as it becomes unpopular,
the percentage of people that are willing
[SPEAKER_00]: to hold on to old cuts when there's no
financial value to it becomes tiny.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have a bunch of stuff going on in
the community where most people there's
[SPEAKER_00]: legendary strains that very few people
relative to today have actually seen or
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so fakes proliferate because they get
passed around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe the person passing it around
doesn't even realize it's a fake because
[SPEAKER_00]: he never had it in 1998.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he doesn't know.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's passing it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, oh, I think I have real snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I trade you this, but he doesn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was real snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was given to me by my buddy who's had
it for forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he swears it's real snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you talk to somebody like me or
Caleb or whoever who actually grew snow
[SPEAKER_00]: back then or someone who or who's held it
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, I'm sorry, but that's
not it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a snow is a bad example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen a fake cut of snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, yeah, it might it might have
been a bad example, but like maybe maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: the Trinity would be a better example or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an excellent example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that might be an act because people
will get mad at me because they would give
[SPEAKER_00]: me their Trinity and they'd be like,
oh, man, I gave up the farm for this cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'd smoke it and I'd be like,
it's not even a hybrid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like I you don't know what I did to get
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, dude, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so there's there's some cuts where
it's like, I mean, one of the things I
[SPEAKER_00]: have no idea what sour cut I hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I lost it, I've collected six or
seven or eight different sour cuts in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last four or five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of them are the are the cut that
I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means that, like, if I lost it,
me trying to find it again would be would
[SPEAKER_00]: be would be shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what happens to a lot of old
cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get arguments about whether
it's real or whether it's not real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a group of collectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's three of them on this
call right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's not that many people that are
willing to hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a joke of give me your old and
unpopular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know, having a big mom room is
a huge pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of trying to keep plants
healthy and bug free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of and then, you know,
98 percent of it isn't commercially
[SPEAKER_00]: viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're holding on to it for preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're holding on to it for maybe some
future breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're holding on to it because most of
the stuff that I hold, I hold it because I
[SPEAKER_00]: personally like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the determining factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what the public thinks,
but most people, you know, it's they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the will or they just want
to hold what's currently popular because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what works for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they think, oh, I know this is this is
how everything gets lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can always get it back from my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got it.
Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to chime in real quick before we
get way too far from the question of the
[SPEAKER_02]: California Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was actually given the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's way far from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we were way far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize to whoever's question it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got real far afield there for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you do when you're a fucking
nerd.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a nerd now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, no, I was given seeds by a guy
that was on the forums named Walking Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people that were around back in
the day knew him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sat on these seats for a long time and
they were labeled Hayes Brothers,
[SPEAKER_02]: California Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I sat on them is because I
was like, what the fuck is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: California, Hayes Brothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're fucking Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I sat on them for a long time
until I came across a high times issue
[SPEAKER_02]: that I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was going through it and I see Hayes
Brothers, California Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, what the, you know,
and by this time, Walking Man's Walking
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude's Dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to figure out, you know,
what are in these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did pop them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did run them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say the closest thing they
look to is what I would associate having
[SPEAKER_02]: grown with Hindu Kush before.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're stretchier.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not like OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: The buds are dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're smaller, more golf ball,
more spread out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stretchier.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is where the OG connection probably
ends with the California Kush that I have
[SPEAKER_02]: grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, are they the original ones from the
Hayes Brothers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they were labeled.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did F gen those and let them out
just in case.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you need to grow them so you can
answer the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty funny is, uh, Caleb,
why, when are you going to come back and
[SPEAKER_00]: why did you make everyone wait so long to
come on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll answer that one for him is,
uh, he, he's real busy, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, he's got a lot of stuff going on part
of being really a prolific breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that that's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's a lot of work to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of work to run rooms and have
things come down and catalog and take the,
[SPEAKER_00]: what did he mention?
[SPEAKER_00]: The 20 million pictures that he has on
file and answer and answer, be responsive,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably on his website and deal with life
and family stuff and eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I haven't responded on the website for
about three months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apologies to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets, it gets difficult,
especially if you're a one man show and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, and you're holding on and you're
trying to do a lot of actual work and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to have a life and
friendships and families and different
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're really appreciative that he gave
us some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he's like one of our really close
friends and we chat like this all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: about things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and, uh, one of the,
one of the aspects that Matt and I are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do is that some of the most
knowledgeable people are not great at self
[SPEAKER_00]: promotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and there's a lot of people
who are really good at self promotion and
[SPEAKER_00]: not that much great at everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Caleb's kind of the reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he's really, really good at
observation and breeding and he has a long
[SPEAKER_00]: history of plants and he's definitely a
weed nerd and has a lot of knowledge in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, public speaking and
making the time for this kind of thing can
[SPEAKER_00]: be relatively hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, so, um, you know,
we're super appreciative that he came on
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're hoping that we'll be able to
occasionally get him to pop back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say, you know, uh, be thankful
he's here and let's hope that he liked it
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, we'll get some other subjects
that interest them enough that he'll pop
[SPEAKER_02]: back on, you know, I really want to do a
show with Fletcher and Caleb together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be pretty phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really maybe some Bodie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, Bodie.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I mean, there's a,
you know, both those guys, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: both those guys are in the same vein,
you know, they're both really
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both have a lot of passion for what
they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both have a lot of projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both do a lot of hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, Bodie would be quite
interesting because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's done a lot of traveling, uh,
which is not common in the modern,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the modern times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, he's gone to a lot of these
regions of origin and poked around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so those are probably some like
really cool stories that he's got in his
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is helping us on the hippie hash trail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, episode, we haven't really talked
about it much, but we will be doing that
[SPEAKER_02]: and Bodie is going to be a major part of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we're, uh, we haven't met,
we haven't, we haven't talked about that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but one of our episode ideas is to sort of
talk about the hippie hashish trail,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's the way that the vast
majority of Afghan seeds actually made
[SPEAKER_00]: their way to America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I talked about in a previous episode,
how all the sativas free seeds came with
[SPEAKER_00]: every kilo of bud that came to America,
but Afghans, they had hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hash didn't contain seeds,
generally speaking on rare occasions it
[SPEAKER_00]: did, but for the most part, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we talked about it a little
earlier, uh, but you know, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Humboldt where Caleb is from,
you know, and Mendo and stuff like that in
[SPEAKER_00]: the central coast of California,
it seems like there was Afghans in the
[SPEAKER_00]: early and mid seventies, but the wave
where most growers that were tied into
[SPEAKER_00]: people really started seeing them was more
77, 78, 79, 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when the waves of Afghan seeds
really started hitting America and hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: groups of growers and getting passed
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I believe that's mostly due to the
hippie hashish trail and people's travels
[SPEAKER_00]: to the far east.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of interest,
I think, in talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and we're going to have an episode
upcoming, uh, that goes way more into
[SPEAKER_00]: depth on some of that hashish and some of
the traditions and some of the travels and
[SPEAKER_00]: how that all worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even just, I mean, just how difficult
it was to even get over there,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and, and trip around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it wasn't in the sixties and
seventies, it was not easy, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to that part of the world,
uh, and to move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's far, it's, you know, it's
different issues today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, far more dangerous, a lot more
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've, um, sadly America has been at war
in that part of the region for quite some
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people's opinions of us have changed a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's certainly a little sketchier,
uh, with the Taliban and some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: various aspects that go on in Afghanistan
and Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that region is one of the
few regions as well where there's still a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of traditional farming going on of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's good in the sense that it's a
resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sad that it's hard to get to for us,
but at least it's still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some people that are
traveling around there that are,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, starting to ship some seeds back to
Europe and do American farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, we've seen a lot of
people from America, from those regions,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe people will find some cool stuff
in this more recent wave of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: heirloom cushions or heirloom Afghans and
stuff like that, that are getting bred
[SPEAKER_00]: over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to do some housekeeping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, for Caleb's, anybody who's interested
in grabbing Caleb seeds, I've seen a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of comments about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find them on speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could find them on his website and he
has a lot of other retailers.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your website, Caleb?
[SPEAKER_01]: HumboldtCSI.com I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're interested, HumboldtCSI.com,
I know Speakeasy has got a bunch of great
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, is there anything else we wanted to
get to?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have we been talking?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty wide ranging discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably are pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, we always, as,
as always, uh, uh, Matt and I will look
[SPEAKER_00]: over the questions and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always too many questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, to get to, if your question didn't get
answered, maybe it'll get answered in a
[SPEAKER_00]: future podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe even it'll be the seed that
starts the whole episode idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so keep your questions coming,
you know, and all that, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can join our discard cords via
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we go in there chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think we're doing movie night
tonight where you fucking sit and watch
[SPEAKER_02]: movies together or TV shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just dick around.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also talked about cannabis stuff,
uh, extensively.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put a lot of my catalogs online and a
lot of my, uh, collection of historical
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty much anybody can access that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a part of our Patreon and I'm putting
up nudes of Caleb in the same folder
[SPEAKER_02]: tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two things real quick,
just cause I see questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see multiple questions about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I gave my, uh, my headband cut to
Caleb to breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's already released a few lines off
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, it's not very well spread out in
the community yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so since he's so prolific at breeding,
uh, and he has such a customer base,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, my main goal was to get it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's done some chem D he's done some
TK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's, you know, there's potential
more work that he's going to do with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as it ends up being worthwhile and
he likes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so that's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then someone asked them some questions
about Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, Mexico is super close,
uh, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the Mexican, uh, the Mexican weed is
controlled a lot by cartels and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of violence associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not so much like the seventies
anymore where you can kind of go down
[SPEAKER_00]: there and like hang out with regular
farmers and maybe get seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit more sketched than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the violence has been quite extreme
for the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so while Mexico does have a large
and diverse population of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, of cannabis down there, and we hope
that, uh, some more of it comes our way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as simple as it was decades ago
to go down there, despite how close it is
[SPEAKER_00]: and poke around and get access to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, anything really worth, um,
getting in Mexico anymore, just with the
[SPEAKER_01]: influx of, uh, you know, European
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hardly doubt it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cartel would have been trying to increase
production at some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're not, they're not stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's their main export other than meth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might, so that might be something
just real quick that we'll end it on is
[SPEAKER_00]: that, uh, sadly, one of the, you know,
I talked about how it's very difficult for
[SPEAKER_00]: us to penetrate Afghanistan and Pakistan
these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be a benefit, um, because it's
keeping their lines a bit more pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some of the European lines have
infested Jamaica, infested Mexico,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these other regions,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these regions have been,
you know, have, you know, some of these,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Morocco, especially cause it's
close to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, they used to have a lot of
traditional cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of different European seed
banks got super lemon haze now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff like that, that they bring down
there and breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there's a lot of regions of origin
that have been polluted for better or for
[SPEAKER_00]: worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, by these other things and you're not
going to go to Jamaica and find some 25
[SPEAKER_00]: week lamb's bread anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to, it's not as easy to
find stuff in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as easy to find stuff in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's part of the issue is that the,
you know, global trade has good and bad
[SPEAKER_00]: parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the sixties and seventies,
a lot of these regions were untouched and
[SPEAKER_00]: they just had what they had from their
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's been a lot of cross
contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, yeah, you know, no one's going
to Morocco looking for super lemon haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: but sadly that's what they might find,
you know, or they might find some LA
[SPEAKER_00]: confidential or whatever over there,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and because those farmers,
those, those farmers just want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, I think, uh,
you know, we can answer a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: questions and we could talk for hours,
but I think we're coming to a good place
[SPEAKER_00]: to close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thank you everybody, everybody that
gives us a bit of time on their Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're going to keep this thing
flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to keep topics of
interest on breeding and different things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, thank you everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, WBD WBD hit up, um, speak easy and get
them your address.
[SPEAKER_02]: You received a free shirt for having the
most upvotes on your question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, get ahold of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everyone, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you found it informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Caleb for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk to you all soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody have a wonderful afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
