[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it was like I was connected with
everything around me.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of a sudden I just started questioning
everything I'd ever been told.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, by the time I got high that very
first time, when it started to hit me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Matthew, the host.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with my friend and co-host,
not so dog, and Raho.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Raho back and we're here with Red
Ryder, a classic Colombian grower from
[SPEAKER_03]: ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to be talking with about
about his history of growing Colombians as
[SPEAKER_03]: well as other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's got a long storied past.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for joining us, Red Ryder.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pleasure to be here with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we we do have a little bit of a lag
with the foreign connection.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we might do for this interview is
Raho knows Red Ryder really well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to hopefully have Raho ask
some very leading questions and then allow
[SPEAKER_08]: Red Ryder to sort of like chat for a while
on those things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Matt and I will chime in here and
there as needed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So apologies for any of the technical
difficulties.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's going to be kind of Raho knows
what what to ask to get the the cool info
[SPEAKER_08]: out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Red Ryder has the cool info.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll start there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we decided to do it chronologically,
Raho.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you have the list in front of you?
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've pasted up in the private chat
section.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: For every for all of us to kind of keep us
on on track.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, thanks for the toss, not so and red.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so great to have you here with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I've been reading your story,
your life story for eight, eight years
[SPEAKER_07]: now, it seems like.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've it's just been such an
adventure to read that when I got introed,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, hooked up with not so and action
Jackson there, Matt, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's what it says on his title on the
screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're listening to the audio.
[SPEAKER_07]: Version of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, got hooked up with these
guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I realized this is an opportunity for some
of the some of my favorite people on the
[SPEAKER_07]: forums to try and get them to come and
share their story in a different platform.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it's just great to have you
joining us and sharing the info.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I remember some of the first
stuff I read from you was talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your your youth, you know, we're about the
same age, so you were smoking in the 70s
[SPEAKER_07]: and and and early 80s and you were telling
your stories about what it was like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, your early days when you first
got high and some different experiences
[SPEAKER_07]: and places you lived around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you tell us a little bit about kind of
those early days and how you got into
[SPEAKER_07]: weed?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, one more thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude ranch in Colorado when I was about 10
years old and that was my first experience
[SPEAKER_14]: seeing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't smoke it or get high,
but I noticed it was that they said it was
[SPEAKER_14]: even Colombian.
[SPEAKER_14]: But we had a campfire.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody was sitting around and they were
smoking it.
[SPEAKER_14]: The older guys and everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they really had a really good
experience with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, it was a few years later
when I actually smoked some and got high.
[SPEAKER_14]: But that was later when I think it was a
very similar story to like you were
[SPEAKER_14]: talking about where after school I was
riding home on the bus and this guy had
[SPEAKER_14]: some joints for sale and.
[SPEAKER_14]: He said it's really, really good man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I and I gave him a dollar, bought two of
them and wrapped in nice pink rolling
[SPEAKER_14]: papers.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I got off the school bus,
I had like a little entourage with me.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know that was wanting to see what
happened when we smoked it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we went out in the woods and that was
when I first really felt it and realized
[SPEAKER_14]: this is something I wanted to keep with me
in my life.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was Mexican the first time,
you know, I'm sure you remember that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I remember that whole that whole
picture you just painted, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can I can still I can picture the
joints.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the paper looked like it was so
thick.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you couldn't see anything
through it and the ends were probably spun
[SPEAKER_07]: and twisted.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if if it unspun, the whole thing would
just dump out, you know, because it was
[SPEAKER_07]: powdery in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and the kids, I can't even imagine the
excitement of the kids kind of chasing
[SPEAKER_07]: along, trying to find a place to hide in
some bushes or some crap, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: as you were, you know, just the pure
innocence of that introduction moment and
[SPEAKER_07]: everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it's great, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the story.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we all identify with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, that's very familiar.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going with your friends and
everybody waiting to see who's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke it first and who's going to have the
first reaction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, I guess that first time
around the campfire, did you actually
[SPEAKER_07]: smoke with those older dudes and not
experience, not get high?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or was it you watched them do it and
thought, oh, this is OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'll someday later.
[SPEAKER_07]: You tried it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, actually, that was this is a ghost
story.
[SPEAKER_14]: We were camping up in the mountains in
Colorado in between Bale and Steamboat
[SPEAKER_14]: Springs.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we were we were probably at twelve
thousand feet way up on top of this
[SPEAKER_14]: mountain.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just watched them smoke a little bit
of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: But in the morning, my cousin,
who was a little bit older than I,
[SPEAKER_14]: told me, oh, man, there were ghosts last
night.
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't you hear all the horses and all the
Indians and everything?
[SPEAKER_14]: And I look up to know, man, I remember any
of that.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: But apparently they woke up in the middle
of the night hearing horses stampeding
[SPEAKER_14]: through the little valley we were in.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it just get louder and louder and
louder and no nothing appeared.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it scared the shit out of all these
guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I didn't hear any of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I only heard the story.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they said, man, I do remember them
saying, man, that Colombian is like like
[SPEAKER_14]: psychedelic, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so they heard things that you couldn't
hear.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it was a ghost story that they used
to tell.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was there when it happened,
but I certainly didn't hear any horses or
[SPEAKER_14]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I do remember that the smell of the
weed was really, really sweet,
[SPEAKER_14]: something I really liked the smell of.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Red, you know, I should have said
this right at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're you know what my my awareness of
you and your experience, the story you're
[SPEAKER_07]: telling is going to be focused very much
about Colombian weed and the country of
[SPEAKER_07]: Colombia and your love affair with both of
those and how what's where that's taking
[SPEAKER_07]: you right through life.
[SPEAKER_07]: So because you've got a great story to
tell there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And most people, you know, if you're
looking at you on that, you're not you're
[SPEAKER_07]: not from Colombia, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You're an American from, you know,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's start talking about that,
that that Colombian weed you were saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: What year was this?
[SPEAKER_07]: The first time you smoked, you didn't.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, let me tell you about the first
time.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I left out an important character,
and that was Becky.
[SPEAKER_14]: Becky was a 16 year old.
[SPEAKER_14]: This was the last day of school.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when she found out I had the
marijuana, when I had the two joints,
[SPEAKER_14]: her her her disposition to me changed and
she became very attentive.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was I suddenly realized that,
man, this weed really gets her excited,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we we walked down towards the lake with
a little group of smaller children
[SPEAKER_14]: following us.
[SPEAKER_14]: And as we got to a certain place,
we lit up the joint.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I I noticed when we lit the
joint, all the little kids were gone.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I gave it to her.
[SPEAKER_14]: She took a couple of big hits and she
grabbed my arm and said, hey, come here.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she put the joint in her mouth,
you know, for a shotgun.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And gave me a big shotgun kiss.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I felt it, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I that shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the first hit of that joint.
[SPEAKER_14]: But man, I felt it right away.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we smoked the rest of the rest of that
joint and we walked down to the I was high
[SPEAKER_14]: as hell.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything was just incredibly.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was afternoon.
[SPEAKER_14]: The sun was out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Birds were out.
[SPEAKER_14]: We walked to this really secluded part of
the lake.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she just took her clothes off and went
into the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as women tend to do around all of us,
I didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't I should have jumped on that,
but I didn't.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just too much.
[SPEAKER_14]: And why?
[SPEAKER_14]: She said, come on in.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I went in my clothes.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was an excellent experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: That shotgun that shotgun kiss is like was
like the sexiest thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Combining your two favorite things in the
world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a good way to get a girl to kiss
you, too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, she and she did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was even better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then she goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's in the water.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I never told her I had another joint
and I kept that other one.
[SPEAKER_14]: I went back home and ate and I was with my
parents and everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I thought, man, I still have a whole
nother joint of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I turned on my best friend.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's like my friend of 40 years,
50 now.
[SPEAKER_14]: And after that, we started trying to grow
it, you know, from all the seeds.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we never really got any plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: But but that started the my quest where I
would divide by every week.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was working then I was 13, but I had a
job.
[SPEAKER_14]: And every week when I got paid,
I'd go to the Yamaha dealership and the
[SPEAKER_14]: mechanic would sell me a nice lid of
Mexican, you know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a great summer.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we rode dirt bikes all summer down
by this lake.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we just get high.
[SPEAKER_14]: I met some other guys that got me high
down there with some really good like tie
[SPEAKER_14]: stick.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, I already knew there was
really good weed around, even though all I
[SPEAKER_14]: could buy was, you know, shit weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: But we were reading high times.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the high times.
[SPEAKER_14]: But to me, high times was like a
penthouse.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's like I knew it existed,
but it wasn't what I was getting very
[SPEAKER_07]: much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they were.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I was just I was just thinking,
you know, that that's my exact same
[SPEAKER_07]: experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a very good friend, you know,
through high school as I was doing all
[SPEAKER_07]: this stuff, you know, side by side.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were we were we were a real pair.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it sounds like you had that same
experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure that's pretty common.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think it's just so refreshing
to get people to come on now who've been
[SPEAKER_07]: chasing this this thing for so long and
who who admit when they weren't a huge og
[SPEAKER_07]: og baller and when things went wrong and
how it was they didn't start off,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, with 100 acres of, you know,
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: They they started off with three plants in
a shadow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and it changed everything,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think I think you, you know,
that honesty makes it just so refreshing
[SPEAKER_07]: compared to.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, look, there are people out there
who have done big, big, big stuff and I
[SPEAKER_07]: respect them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's real love hearing the stories,
but there's also people out there fronting
[SPEAKER_07]: that they're they're more than and were
more than what they really were.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just like I like the honest red,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_14]: So please continue to one check.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what happened was the other I went I
took them to my parents' house.
[SPEAKER_14]: We weren't there.
[SPEAKER_14]: My parents weren't there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I tried to get them to come in to
listen to some music.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they said, no, it looked a little
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_14]: In the house.
[SPEAKER_14]: And but the Colombian girl Uchi Uchi,
she said, yeah, I'll go in with in one
[SPEAKER_14]: thing led to another.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I started seeing her by herself.
[SPEAKER_14]: And one night I bought some really good
lumbo, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, this was a good 50, 45 dollar lid
of lumbo.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I thought it was just really,
really good.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was with her and I said,
look, you have to try this.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to try this.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's it's from your country, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And believe it or not, she took a hit of
it and threw it down.
[SPEAKER_14]: We were outside.
[SPEAKER_14]: She threw it on the ground.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, hey, well, that's my.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But between her lovely cleavage,
she pulled out a joint, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she said, now, this is good weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she lit that shit up.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's when I really had some good,
good connoisseur Colombian, but also fell
[SPEAKER_14]: in love with her.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I mean, it was kind of a
combination thing there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then I had to know more about Colombia.
[SPEAKER_14]: But she left.
[SPEAKER_14]: She was there for three weeks and went
back to Colombia and never heard from her
[SPEAKER_14]: again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the best Colombian love story
ever.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to satisfy all of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Red, red, red.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the best Colombian love story
ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_07]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it goes on that man.
[SPEAKER_07]: What happened after that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we didn't get all of the American
part of the story yet, did we?
[SPEAKER_14]: No, this was the first time I got high.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't know why, but I'd smoked it
before.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'd smoked weed before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's common for a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the first time we we smoke,
we don't quite know what we're what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know how much to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really maybe sometimes don't know
how how to inhale correctly at that point,
[SPEAKER_03]: depending on if we smoke cigarettes or not
by that age.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think our brain just doesn't know
how to process it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't understand the high.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like it takes three or four times to
where you're like, oh, this is
[SPEAKER_03]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when the boys in the lab coats
start talking about cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, from the end, the
endocannabinoid cannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_07]: you think about the first time you flood
those things with an external cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really cool because, you know,
who knows, maybe maybe like the first time
[SPEAKER_07]: you do that, it's like, whoa, you know,
your cannabinoids are all personalizing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's, you know, whoa.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they're really reacting to this
flood of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't know what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they shut down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'm blocking or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just throwing this shit out there,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: That stuff we were smoking had been
through hell before it got to us.
So.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you writer, have you heard of
something called CHS out there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I think it's cannabinoid hypermesis
syndrome?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's fairly new.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's something that they've been
pushing like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've both my brother and my cousin have
gone to the ER recently with some cyclic
[SPEAKER_03]: vomiting, kind of like I have to like,
and they, the nurses keep pushing this
[SPEAKER_03]: idea that it's from something called CHS
cannabinoid hypermesis syndrome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's something, and I started doing
research into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of my good friends is an ER doctor
and he's a, he's a smoker too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's been really researching this
because he started having similar
[SPEAKER_03]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from what they can tell early on the
research thought they thought maybe it's
[SPEAKER_03]: from a crop sprayed with neem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but they're not sure if that really is
the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not sure if it's from,
you know, heavy use of extracts since a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of people randomly use extracts with
flour and it just too much for our
[SPEAKER_03]: systems, but whatever it is, it's
inducing, um, uh, cyclical vomiting in
[SPEAKER_03]: people just like day after day after day
of endless puking in people that they just
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know why.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they call it cannabinoid hypermesis
syndrome, but realistically it could be
[SPEAKER_03]: related to terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be related to an unknown or
untested for cannabinoid, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: not THC, but it could be, you know,
God knows what else, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be popping up more and
more.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the presence of, uh, of foreign
stuff and concentrates.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, none of this really happened until
there was a, a legal market.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there's a lot of causation,
you know, um, correlation causation type.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably going on, but you know,
I, I, did you, uh, talk to any of your
[SPEAKER_07]: family about the theory I talked with you
about, about the effects of breathing
[SPEAKER_07]: superheated shit from a butane torches?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so neither of them do that,
but they, they both are very heavy,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, like vape cartridge users,
like the cart, like the isolate cart shit,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, I remember the guy that,
that used to measure, that used to measure
[SPEAKER_07]: this mystery oil and all the available
butane on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That guy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get frustrated with science these days
because they all have these other agendas.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's just like, where's the
money coming from?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, then I moved to Florida because my
father, my stepmother lived in,
[SPEAKER_14]: in West Palm beach.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, that's where I, I, uh,
had the Dan, the painter man story.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, that's where the guy, he was a drug
dealer, lived right upstairs and he was
[SPEAKER_14]: getting all these fantastic imports coming
through South Florida at the time.
[SPEAKER_14]: And in fact, that's when I first saw the
first Indica.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: What year?
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, that was, that was actually the spring
of 1980.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I didn't know it was Indica.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, as a matter of fact, uh, I only read
about Indica in high times.
[SPEAKER_14]: I, I really didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, I did grow plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: I started growing plants in Texas in the
late seventies, but I didn't know how to
[SPEAKER_14]: do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't know how to flower them or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that why you moved to Columbia?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause they just do, you can't mess it up.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, I went to Cartagena in 2000.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, two, uh, February, January,
two met her online.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I met her online.
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought, man, I want to, I want to find
a woman.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I want to meet a woman.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I thought, where, where should I find,
where, what, what woman would I want?
[SPEAKER_14]: So I started looking in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, when I say looking, there was a,
a program called I see her.
[SPEAKER_14]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_14]: I see Q.
[SPEAKER_14]: I see Q.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it allows you to do specific searches,
women between the age of this age speak
[SPEAKER_14]: English.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I flooded every one of them with a
generic letter saying, hello, my name's
[SPEAKER_14]: James.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a gringo.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm interested in meeting someone.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I got many replies back.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Pardon me.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, as I was responding to these
replies, I started talking to a woman in
[SPEAKER_14]: Pope John.
[SPEAKER_14]: Pope John is in the Calca Calca,
the budget, not the budget of Calca,
[SPEAKER_14]: the Calca itself.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is a beautiful valley,
man.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is where you want to grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is where the creepy comes from the
best.
[SPEAKER_14]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll get there, but she lived in the
middle of it and we weren't friends about
[SPEAKER_14]: weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, we didn't even talk about it,
but, uh, I, my, my mother came one day and
[SPEAKER_14]: she said, Hey, uh, why don't you,
uh, go with, uh, why don't you go meet
[SPEAKER_14]: her?
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you're so in love.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I said, mom, she lives in Columbia for
God's sake.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no way.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And my mother said, Oh, man, what kind of
man are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mom's gangster.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
Wow.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: Follow your heart.
[SPEAKER_14]: Follow your heart.
[SPEAKER_14]: She says, have love will travel.
[SPEAKER_14]: This was after she had her aneurysm too.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was kind of, yeah, don't take stock
advice from her, but, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: go, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: But as it turned out, I was talking to her
and this was only a friendship.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I didn't, I wasn't talking any
kind of romance or anything, but I said,
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm, I'm reserving the rooms.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I'm going to get you a room and get me
a room.
[SPEAKER_14]: She said, Oh, save the money.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll just get one.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I said, okay, one with two beds.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she said, no, just get one bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, you know, there goes the
direction in my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, at least you know, what's up at
that point.
[SPEAKER_14]: But here's something very interesting.
[SPEAKER_14]: She had a son that was about, I don't
know, 17 years old.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I got to talking to him one day.
[SPEAKER_14]: She wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_14]: He also spoke English and he said,
what are you doing with my mom?
[SPEAKER_14]: You know?
[SPEAKER_14]: And I said, I, I think I love her.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to go meet her.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know?
[SPEAKER_14]: And he said, do you smoke weed?
[SPEAKER_14]: And I said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: He told me that where he lived was where
they grew the best.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he started showing me pictures on the
webcam.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was just like what I remember.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I started getting the,
the, the hunger for Colombian again.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I mentioned just reawakened,
it was always there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: When I saw the picture, man, it just
flooded me with memories.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: Was this 95?
[SPEAKER_14]: This was no, no, actually this was 2001,
right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Around nine 11, when nine 11 happened.
[SPEAKER_14]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was right after that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, but anyway, I decided I'm going to go
down to Columbia in February of 2002.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I met this woman and fell in love with
her, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, had the best, I couldn't think of
a better time, but she didn't get high.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the third day I was there,
I said, man, I'm going to ask somebody,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, Hey, can you hook me up?
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, she was like, don't do it there.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll go crazy.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, it's a terrible drug and all this.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I asked, I said, no, it's not really
listen to me.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I got some, this guy said, yeah,
I'll sell you a bag, $20, about a quarter
[SPEAKER_14]: pound.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Beautiful, beautiful nickel, nickel size
brown buds.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the smell, I opened that bag and oh
man, I was right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Back in the, in the seventies,
man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I, we had changed hotels to the Hilton.
[SPEAKER_14]: There were some reason I got a really good
rate on this beautiful, incredible room
[SPEAKER_14]: overlooking the lagoon and, uh,
Cartagena.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wanted to roll that shit up.
[SPEAKER_14]: First thing I did was I ran out on the
balcony and got my papers and started
[SPEAKER_14]: breaking it down.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I looked around and I thought,
where the, where the hell is she at?
[SPEAKER_14]: And she had went in the bathroom and
locked the door.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, don't worry, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I, I lift that up and I got high
as hell.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I knocked on the door and I was like,
Hey, Hey.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, she said, what?
[SPEAKER_14]: She opened up the door and I stand in
there with an erection from hell,
[SPEAKER_14]: man.
[SPEAKER_14]: This does this to you, but it was a
beautiful romantic experience with the
[SPEAKER_14]: Colombian again, again.
[SPEAKER_03]: She locked the door.
[SPEAKER_03]: So was she scared of like the consequences
of someone might smell it and the cops
[SPEAKER_03]: coming or.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, she was afraid it was going to make me
go crazy because they, they don't think of
[SPEAKER_14]: drugs like we do.
[SPEAKER_14]: They, they really don't.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a narco state and the normal
people, the regular people don't,
[SPEAKER_14]: they don't fuck with drugs.
[SPEAKER_14]: They just don't do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Alcoholics, you know, you like drinking
come here.
[SPEAKER_14]: They drink more than Germans.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we have 22 holidays a year,
22.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Five in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there always is always a festival,
a party or a reason to get drunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_14]: No weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Narco states are weird, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and it makes sense though,
because of the propaganda that the U S had
[SPEAKER_03]: pushed down there so hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and we got a big taste of it here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a, it's interesting though,
because, you know, by the, by the
[SPEAKER_07]: eighties, I think most people in the
country kind of realized it was not true.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, but there, there are huge parts of
the population that who just bought it
[SPEAKER_07]: hook line and sinker.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, you know, they, they just bought
it and they passed it down to their
[SPEAKER_07]: children.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just repeat it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, myths and it's, uh, very powerful.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that much, she must, she was
scared, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: She was legitimately scared.
[SPEAKER_07]: You were going to come back and be like
the crazy guy from playing the piano and
[SPEAKER_03]: reefer madness, you know, while we're,
while we're here in, um, in like the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the DEA propaganda territory, why don't we
cover some of the, uh, parts about the
[SPEAKER_03]: perceptions of Columbia?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the dangerous parts, like how
dangerous it is or isn't to go there and
[SPEAKER_03]: the perception from America and that,
and your, your fears when you first went
[SPEAKER_03]: there, what were your concerns?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, uh, when I was doing a lot of
traveling in South America in the
[SPEAKER_08]: nineties, Columbia was the one place I
didn't go because it was so sketchy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it seems like very comfortable and
nice and there's all kinds of travel in
[SPEAKER_08]: and out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but it was by far the most violent and
sketchy place, you know, in the nineties,
[SPEAKER_14]: at least in the nineties was Pablo
Escobar.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it was, it was like, I mean,
my dad has some crazy stories,
[SPEAKER_08]: but of, of going there on business and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, now it's like reversed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to Venezuela because, uh,
Columbia was trashed and now it's
[SPEAKER_08]: reversed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like nobody goes to Venezuela and Columbia
is like super nice and like beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure it was then too.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just was not so accessible.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if you, if you, if you come down
here and you go on the street and act like
[SPEAKER_14]: a fool, act like a rock star, you're,
you're going to get, they're going to get
[SPEAKER_14]: you.
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you're, if you're polite,
respectful, and not stupid, a lot of guys
[SPEAKER_14]: get jacked when they come down here,
buying cocaine or buying prostitutes.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's how they get you with the
women.
[SPEAKER_14]: You've heard us, uh, Scott, uh,
the drug that, uh, I forget what they call
[SPEAKER_14]: it, but they blow this stuff in your face
and rob you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go Palomino.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, like deterra powders.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I, uh, when I would travel in central
and South America, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: I would wear crappy clothes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I would, I would not,
I would not want to know this is like way
[SPEAKER_08]: nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I will, I mean, you just like
growing up in a big city.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to not look like a Mark.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd blend in.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I, I've worked here.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've lived in the worst barrios in Bogota.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I mean, this is the red light zone
where it's very cheap prostitutes,
[SPEAKER_14]: really a bad area.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I never had a problem because I was
just very conscious of what was going on
[SPEAKER_14]: around me and never had anything to steal.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: The only thing I have that's of value is
weed and here weed doesn't have very much
[SPEAKER_14]: value, but to me it's worth more than
money.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I said, the first, my first love in
1977 was 78 or was it 79 with the first
[SPEAKER_14]: Colombian girl that I met who she Rion,
uh, she smoked, but she was from a very
[SPEAKER_14]: rich family.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, as in regards to security,
a lot of it's common sense, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to go out and play the fool,
you want to go out and, and, and hook up
[SPEAKER_14]: with prostitutes on Tinder, shit like
that, you're going to get jacked.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you walk down the street and
counting your money, speaking in English,
[SPEAKER_14]: you're going to get jacked.
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll come right out in the middle of
the day.
[SPEAKER_14]: The police only protect you here if you're
paying them.
[SPEAKER_14]: There is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: So good.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's a, I mean, that's a nice direct
contract.
[SPEAKER_07]: At least, you know, you can get
protection, you know, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you could do that in the
States.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not dangerous.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not, it's not any more dangerous than
if you walk down, uh, downtown St. Louis
[SPEAKER_14]: or Fulton County, Atlanta.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to get jacked quicker there
because you look different.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Matt, you look like a Pisa, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: You look like a Pisa guy.
[SPEAKER_14]: You look like you're from India,
man.
[SPEAKER_14]: You really do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can probably pass down there pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until they heard me speak, uh,
Spanish or any of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's when they know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to borrow Jorge Cervantes' wig
when I go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll get you anywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll blend right in.
[SPEAKER_14]: But let me tell you the truth,
Colombian people in general are very,
[SPEAKER_14]: very friendly, very welcoming,
very hospitable.
[SPEAKER_14]: They love foreigners.
[SPEAKER_14]: The, the girls are really attracted to,
to, uh, North Americans, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: and they're, they want to be friends with
Americans.
[SPEAKER_14]: Columbia is a very, they believe the
United States is a great, great country
[SPEAKER_14]: and helps them.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're down, we're down in Florida,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, we're down in Florida.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don, the painter is upstairs slinging,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Slinging weed and whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or else you, you, you try, you tried
Indica and you're growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: All this has happened in Florida,
right?
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, this was Boca Raton.
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember going to see Bob Seeger and the
silver bullet band, uh, and Easter.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a big concert at Hollywood
sportatorium.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I remember I had to have a bag of gold
to take with me to impress everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Dan scored me some, but it was more
orange.
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't the gold like I had in Texas.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is more of an orange.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really good, but different.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: We went to that concert and there was some
beautiful hippie chick that came up to us
[SPEAKER_14]: and said, Hey, you look like you need an
Easter kiss.
[SPEAKER_14]: And my brother was on that like,
like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But actually I tried some, uh,
another Colombian that she, she just gave
[SPEAKER_14]: us a bag of weed and it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, it was great.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was green though.
[SPEAKER_14]: Real green Colombian had the smell,
had the taste.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, Dan, Dan got every kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: He got the Gainesville green.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you guys ever heard of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk about that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like your early experience with the smell
or maybe possibly describe the smell and
[SPEAKER_03]: look of Gainesville green or what you
thought might be in it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Gainesville green reminded me now of
what I, what I grow is Oaxacan.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very similar, but it wasn't similar
to the Oaxacan back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was green and it was since the media
and it had a real piney.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how it's real piney tiny real
nice high real, real clear.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I like is clear clarity.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, which unfortunately most Colombians
weren't back then.
[SPEAKER_14]: The red was like a really, really dirty
high kind of, but, uh, the whole,
[SPEAKER_14]: the Gainesville green, the Maui,
the Maui, Maui Wowie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Came in a, came in a can of nuts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I read that they are heard that,
you know, like shipping it over in
[SPEAKER_08]: macadamia nut cans was a big thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's so wild.
[SPEAKER_14]: Open it up and just incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes sense for smell to hide the
smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything smart.
[SPEAKER_14]: He was teasing me with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: He started to let me smell it,
pull it away.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they never found his body.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never saw it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, um, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So start, let's start talking about that,
that, um, that Colombian weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You were saying what, what year was this?
[SPEAKER_14]: The first time you smoke, you didn't,
well, let me tell you about the first
[SPEAKER_14]: time.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I left out an important character and
that was Becky.
[SPEAKER_14]: Becky was a 16 year old.
[SPEAKER_14]: This was the last day of school and she
went home and when she found out I had the
[SPEAKER_14]: marijuana, when I had the two joints,
uh, her, her, her disposition to me
[SPEAKER_14]: changed and she became very attentive.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was, I, I suddenly realized that,
man, this weed really gets her excited,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, so we, we walked down towards
the lake with a little group of,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, smaller children following us.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, as we got to a certain place,
we lit up the joint and when I,
[SPEAKER_14]: I noticed when we lit the joint,
all the little kids were gone,
[SPEAKER_14]: but I gave it to her.
[SPEAKER_14]: She took a couple of big hits and she
grabbed my arm and said, Hey, come here.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she put the joint in her mouth,
you know, for a shotgun and gave me a big
[SPEAKER_14]: shotgun kiss.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I felt it, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I, that shit, that was the first
hit of that joint, but man, I felt it
[SPEAKER_14]: right away and we smoked the rest of that
joint.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we walked down to the, I was high as
hell.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything was just incredibly,
it was afternoon, the sun was out,
[SPEAKER_14]: birds were out.
[SPEAKER_14]: We walked to this really secluded part of
the lake and she just took her clothes off
[SPEAKER_14]: and went into the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, as women tend to do around all of
us.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't, I should have jumped on that,
but I didn't, I was just too much in,
[SPEAKER_14]: wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she said, come on in.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I went into my clothes.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was an excellent experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: That shotgun, that shotgun kiss is like,
was like the sexiest thing ever.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Combining your two favorite things in the
world.
Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a good way to get a girl to kiss
you too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, she, and she did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was even better.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then she goes, she's in the water.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I never told her I had another joint
and I kept that other one.
[SPEAKER_14]: I went back home and I ate and I was with
my parents and everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I thought, man, I still have a whole
nother joint of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I turned on my best friend.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's like my friend of 40 years,
50 now.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, after that we started trying to
grow it, you know, from all the seeds and
[SPEAKER_14]: we never really got any plants,
but, but that started the, uh,
[SPEAKER_14]: my quest where I would divide by every
week I was working then I was 13,
[SPEAKER_14]: but I had a job and every week when I got
paid, I'd go over to the Yamaha dealership
[SPEAKER_14]: and, uh, the mechanic would sell me a nice
lid of Mexican, you know, nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a great summer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: We, we rode dirt bikes all summer down by
this lake and, uh, we just get high.
[SPEAKER_14]: I met some other guys that got me high
down there with some really good like tie
[SPEAKER_14]: stick.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, I already knew there was
really good weed around, uh, even though
[SPEAKER_14]: all I could buy was, you know,
shit weed, but we were reading high times
[SPEAKER_14]: and the high times I, but to me high times
was like a penthouse.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's like, I knew it existed,
but it wasn't what I was getting very
[SPEAKER_07]: much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I was just, I was just thinking,
you know, that, um, that's my exact same
[SPEAKER_07]: experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: I, I had a very good friend, um,
you know, through high school as I was
[SPEAKER_07]: doing all this stuff, you know,
side by side, we were, we were,
[SPEAKER_07]: we were a real pair and it sounds like you
had that, that same experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: I, I'm sure that's pretty common.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think it's just so refreshing
to get people to come on now who've been,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, chasing this, this thing for so
long and who, who admit when they weren't
[SPEAKER_07]: a huge OG, the OG baller and when things
went wrong and how it was, it,
[SPEAKER_07]: they didn't start off, you know,
with a hundred acres of, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: of, of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: They, they started off with three plants
in a shadow and, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: and it changed everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think, I think you, um, you know,
that honesty makes it just so refreshing
[SPEAKER_07]: compared to, I mean, look, there are
people out there who, have done big,
[SPEAKER_07]: big, big stuff and I respect them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's real love hearing the stories,
but there's also people out there fronting
[SPEAKER_07]: that they're, they're more than,
and were more than what they really were.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just like, I liked the honesty,
right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, please continue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't get all of the American part of
the story yet, did we?
[SPEAKER_14]: No, this was the first time I got high and
I don't know why, but I'd smoked it
[SPEAKER_14]: before.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'd smoked weed before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's common for a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the first time we, we smoke,
we don't quite know what to, what we're,
[SPEAKER_03]: what we're going to experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know how much to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really, maybe sometimes don't
know how, how to inhale correctly at that
[SPEAKER_03]: point, depending on if we smoke cigarettes
or not by that age.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think our brain just doesn't know
how to process it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't understand the high.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like it takes three or four times to
where you're like, ah, this is
[SPEAKER_03]: comfortable, you know?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when the boys in the lab coats
start talking about cannabinoid receptors,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, from the end, the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_07]: You think about the first time you flood
those things with an external cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause you know, maybe, who knows,
maybe, maybe like the first time you do
[SPEAKER_07]: that, it's like, whoa, you know,
your cannabinoids are all personalizing
[SPEAKER_07]: them, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's, you know, whoa.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they're, they're really reacting
to this flood of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't know what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they, they shut down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first time, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'm blocking or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just throwing this shit out there,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: That stuff we were smoking had been
through hell before it got to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So have you, uh, writer, have you heard of
something called CHS out there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, can I think it's cannabinoid
hypermesis syndrome?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's fairly new.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, it's something that they've been
pushing like, so I both my brother,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, or, and my cousin have gone to the ER
recently with some cyclic vomiting,
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of like I have to like, and they,
the nurses keep pushing this idea that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's from something called CHS cannabinoid
hypermesis syndrome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's something, and I started doing
research into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of my good friends is an ER doctor
and he's a, he's a smoker too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's been really researching this cause
he started having similar symptoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from what they can tell early on the
research thought they thought maybe it's
[SPEAKER_03]: from a crop sprayed with neem oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but they're not sure if that really is
the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not sure if it's from,
you know, heavy use of extracts since a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of people randomly use extracts with
flour and it just too much for our
[SPEAKER_03]: systems, but whatever it is, it's
inducing, um, uh, cyclical vomiting in
[SPEAKER_03]: people just like day after day after day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of endless puking in people, but they just
don't know why.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and they call it cannabinoid
hypermesis syndrome, but realistically it
[SPEAKER_03]: could be related to terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be related to an unknown or
untested for cannabinoid, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: not THC, but it could be, you know,
God knows what else, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's an interesting one that's going to
be popping up more and more.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the presence of, uh, of foreign
stuff and concentrates.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, none of this really happened until
there was, uh, uh, illegal market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there's a lot of causation,
you know, um, correlation causation type
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably going on, but you know,
I, I, did you, uh, talk to any of your
[SPEAKER_07]: family about the theory I talked with you
about, about the effects of breathing
[SPEAKER_07]: superheated shit from a butane torches?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so neither of them do that,
but they breathe.
[SPEAKER_03]: They both are very heavy, um, like vape
cartridge users.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the cart, like the isolate cart shit,
you know, remember the guy that used to
[SPEAKER_07]: measure that used to measure this mystery
oil and all the available butane on the
[SPEAKER_07]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get frustrated with science these days
because they all have these other agendas.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's just like, where's the
money coming from?
[SPEAKER_07]: Since you're familiar with all the
Mexicans and everything, do you,
[SPEAKER_07]: when you, uh, that Maui, um, the can of
Maui, did it, did it remind you,
[SPEAKER_07]: were there any Mexican traits to the,
any, any similarity at all?
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, no, I never had cannabis like that
before or since it had a real flowery,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, you could feel the islands in it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You could feel that tropical sunshine when
you hit it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't get very much.
[SPEAKER_14]: He, he, he, I couldn't buy it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was too expensive, but I would just
kind of hang around when other people
[SPEAKER_14]: would buy it so I could taste it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, uh, yeah, that, and there was,
there was other ones that was right about
[SPEAKER_14]: when we started seeing Indica and
everybody was really impressed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it tastes like black hash and it was a
real narcotic high, but, uh, all I could
[SPEAKER_14]: really afford was the Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now there were good Mexicans, but most of
them were I don't know why they imported
[SPEAKER_14]: it.
Really.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a transition period, you know,
while the markets were shaking out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but you know, that Colombo that we
used to get imported, hell man,
[SPEAKER_07]: half of that stuff with seeds is,
so I was thinking about what we used to do
[SPEAKER_07]: with that stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, people would just throw handfuls
of that fresh Colombian seed out in their
[SPEAKER_07]: yard and just have big, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it seemed like half the weight
they got imported was seed and how tragic
[SPEAKER_07]: it was that we just, you know,
waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you just said about, um, you know,
you were talking about how uplifting and
[SPEAKER_07]: clear the Awoken was and, and,
and, you know, the way you said it,
[SPEAKER_07]: that, you know, you know, the Colombian
just wasn't like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, you know, people don't realize
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, uh, it was, uh, you know,
it was groggy was the way it felt a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: times.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a good word for it?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But some of the real high quality the
golds were spiritual, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: And some of the red bud was really,
really good, but dirty, a little dirty at
[SPEAKER_14]: the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if all you ever smoked was the,
was the low end stuff, you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_07]: recognize, you know, if it, that it had
some of that same stuff that the high end
[SPEAKER_07]: had in it, but it was just kind of buried
under a layer of just, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: bad handling and, and, you know,
yeah, it was, yeah, it was just crap,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, but it had, it was still there,
but you had to even recognize that you had
[SPEAKER_07]: to have had the good stuff at some point
say, Oh, that's, Oh, it's in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, anyway, sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sidetracking.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that's, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember, uh, uh, right when,
uh, I can't, this is 1980.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I joined the military eventually,
but before that, I went, I went back to
[SPEAKER_14]: Texas and I, I, my bro, my cousin had this
friend named Jay that was kind of a jock,
[SPEAKER_14]: kind of a sports guy.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he needed somebody to ride with him
from Dallas to, uh, Houston to pick up
[SPEAKER_14]: some, uh, Panama red.
[SPEAKER_14]: He said it was supposed to be real Panama
red.
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course I jumped on it, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanted to ride with him and,
and we shot right down to Baytown.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I remember he, he went into this real,
uh, real rough barn and tugboat and it was
[SPEAKER_14]: like a biker bar, man, and people getting
shot in there and everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: But he bought the pound and we,
we cruised on back to Dallas.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, like I said, I don't know if it
was really Panama red.
[SPEAKER_14]: It seemed to me like it was just real good
Colombian red, but he was selling it back
[SPEAKER_14]: then that he was selling that for a
hundred, uh, an ounce.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it seems like the red.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the red was all biker controlled or
something.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got more stories.
[SPEAKER_14]: My, my older brother was a wholesale
dealer in 78 and he was bringing in
[SPEAKER_14]: truckloads of the Mexican ship.
[SPEAKER_14]: We, you know, the brick stuff,
but he also had a private stash.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is where I first saw California
since Amelia.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, and I saw really good gold.
[SPEAKER_14]: Really good Colombians.
[SPEAKER_14]: This was the top of the line that he could
get.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, I remember one time I asked him,
I said, man, which is, what is this since
[SPEAKER_14]: Amelia?
[SPEAKER_14]: What is this stuff?
[SPEAKER_14]: And he said, it's, it's primo.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he said, but this is better.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he had some Colombian red,
but in this stuff would make you feel,
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't describe it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It just made, fixed you, healed your body,
healed your mind.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was really clean, really clean.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, you know, secondary and everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, I also found out about cocaine
from him too.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was also really clean, really pure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, he didn't know about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: One morning I got up for school and I
opened up the refrigerator and all these
[SPEAKER_14]: little envelopes fall onto the floor.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I thought, what is this man?
[SPEAKER_14]: And I poured one out.
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a big glass kitchen table and I
poured it on the table.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I said, what is this?
[SPEAKER_14]: Next thing you know, I go to school and my
friend, this girl that I wasn't romantic
[SPEAKER_14]: with, but I guess she thought that she saw
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she said, we're not going to school
today.
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_14]: We sniffed it all day, but that was a,
she knew what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, my brother got busted,
uh, there for, uh, not for, he didn't have
[SPEAKER_14]: any drugs, but the guy that he was running
around with, uh, knew an undercover cop
[SPEAKER_14]: and they were going to rob him.
[SPEAKER_14]: My brother didn't know it.
[SPEAKER_14]: My brother thought he was going to really
make a sale.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when they went to meet the cop,
uh, the, the friend of my brother pulled
[SPEAKER_14]: out a pistol and killed him.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the woods were all wired with police.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, I didn't see my brother for about
five years after that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, except for my brother, who was,
he was like a rock star.
[SPEAKER_14]: He thought he was like a rock star.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, he, he would say, try this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is 82, 82 as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, see, I was in Europe, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: When, uh, the last of the great,
uh, import hash, you know, the Afghanistan
[SPEAKER_14]: is the package, uh, Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_14]: We used to get red Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was like gum, like big red gum.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was soft and you could bend it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was just, we called it choking red.
[SPEAKER_14]: It would light your lungs up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't they, there was rumors it was mixed
with gum Arabic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would light your lungs up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_14]: It was real soft.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could, well, but it could also get hard
as a rock too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you got it soft and you were
getting good stuff, everything we got of
[SPEAKER_07]: that Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was pretty much all that was
around where we were.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was hard as a rock and it barely got
you high.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it might've had CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean the black.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was my golden red.
[SPEAKER_08]: My experience is that, um, or from
everything I've been able to gather is
[SPEAKER_08]: that like Europe got the far better hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Canada got some, sometimes some relatively
decent hash and the United States and the
[SPEAKER_08]: United States got the, got the shit that
stuck to your shoe.
[SPEAKER_08]: They got the C grade and the D grade,
everything that they couldn't sell in
[SPEAKER_08]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Europe, they were like, we'll send to
America cause they'll take anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so maybe you could talk about that for
a second.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you were in, when you were in Europe,
when you were stationed in Europe,
[SPEAKER_08]: you got to experience a bunch of,
of hashish.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I was stationed in a infantry
battalion in bomb holder wet.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was West Germany then.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, I mean, we were always out in the
field.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was in the infantry, so we were always
camping out and all this shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, uh, we would get, uh, what they'd
call a plate.
[SPEAKER_14]: A plate was about $200 and it was a
hundred grams.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, or we get a piece and a piece would
be $20, but it could be one gram or three
[SPEAKER_14]: grams.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, this was all in the barracks.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, this is all with our service
guys, no Germans or anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: No urine tests for cannabis back then,
right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Pardon me?
[SPEAKER_07]: No urine tests for cannabis back then.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, but that's when they started.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's when, you know, I, I found out
then that the military frowned on this
[SPEAKER_14]: behavior.
[SPEAKER_07]: Had you told me, was that not right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, did I do something wrong?
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was like, cause nobody's seen weed
there.
[SPEAKER_14]: None of the Germans, nobody had weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: We were selling it for $25 a joint.
[SPEAKER_14]: This guy was selling joints for $25 and I
was buying a hundred dollars, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, yeah, but it was excellent.
[SPEAKER_14]: I go into some of the, the, the,
uh, Gasthof's, you know, where they have
[SPEAKER_14]: the bar and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just light one up because the smell
was so different.
[SPEAKER_14]: It didn't smell like hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then we'd smoke it publicly.
[SPEAKER_07]: What did it smell like?
[SPEAKER_07]: Smell of Colombian.
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not helpful, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't even know what Matt was saying
the whole time about, I don't know what I
[SPEAKER_07]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are talking about this mystery
magic and you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you can see something I can't see.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to give them something to,
something to bite into, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: What, what did it smell taste?
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, gentlemen, I'm going to tell you
something right now that, that you will
[SPEAKER_14]: experience that taste and you will
experience it pretty soon because I'm,
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm, I've been growing it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know how to cure it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know how to do everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now it's legal.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to send you some.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're stopped piling it like a prepper
down there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, one thing, you know, when we had
our little gathering recently,
[SPEAKER_08]: when we had our little gathering recently
or whatever, uh, one of the clear things
[SPEAKER_08]: that comes up is you can get people that
have, that have been in cannabis their
[SPEAKER_08]: whole life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and describing taste and aroma is
almost everyone's weak point.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you're like, what does it taste
like?
[SPEAKER_08]: What does it smell like?
[SPEAKER_08]: And to you, you could be like,
Oh, this reminds me of 1978 or this smells
[SPEAKER_08]: clearly like what I remember.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you try to piece together what that
smell is, the language is insufficient.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a special language for that stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, it's, um, and some of it is
just experiential, you know, like when you
[SPEAKER_07]: talk about baby poo, I think you were
saying the other day, not so about the
[SPEAKER_07]: smell of baby poo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: People think that this is some,
you know, some other way to say skunk or
[SPEAKER_07]: that they're imagining something that they
see on a toilet paper after they do their
[SPEAKER_07]: business, but it's not it, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a whole, it's a, if you've never had
a kid or been around little babies,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, you don't, you, you'll never
smell that smell anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is no frame of reference to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had three kids in four years.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the smell of young kid baby poo is,
is a pretty, pretty, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: that was, that was daily life for quite
some time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it triggers and it triggers emotional,
you know, memory response to, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: the, that, that smell, it's all connected
to the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm a daddy, you know, but,
um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, red, we can do better than
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, so you're talking about gold
sandalwood is, is, uh, is, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: one of those woody smells.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: The, the, the really blonde gold to me
have a, a sandalwood incense burnt,
[SPEAKER_14]: almost caramel, almost sweet, but not
sweet.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, it was really good.
[SPEAKER_14]: It had a different flavor on the exhale
that was, that was kind of addictive.
[SPEAKER_14]: I, you'd want to taste it again and again.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the, the ones like the purples,
they didn't have a fruity flavor or smell
[SPEAKER_14]: like you'd think looking at it,
but it would have more like, uh,
[SPEAKER_14]: again, a woody, but not cedar more like
just, uh, a wood, wood incense taste.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the reds were very cedar tasting with
a delicious, uh, I can't, it's like a
[SPEAKER_14]: burnt malt almost for, you know,
the greatest burnt malt, like a,
[SPEAKER_03]: like a wood.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're cutting in and out again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Hey, um, so yeah, you got laggy
again.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I tried to talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Hey, that burnt malt, is that like a
Lomi kind of a Pete?
[SPEAKER_14]: But, but let me tell you, uh, when I was
growing up my, in Texas, my, my uncle was
[SPEAKER_14]: really wealthy.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, I had two cousins and one was a
little bit older than I was.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the other one was my age, but,
uh, my uncle, when we got summer vacation,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, that was just time we had to go to
work for him.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he owned these big properties,
very close to DFW airport.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was our job to mow them.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't mean with a lawnmower.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, with a four cutter, uh,
tractor.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was extremely hot, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, no shade, nothing.
[SPEAKER_14]: You were out there 12 hours, sun up,
sun down.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, a lot of times they'd go when we
didn't have something to cut my,
[SPEAKER_14]: my aunt and uncle would leave early for
work.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'd get up and, uh, one more and go
sit out on the front porch and smoke a
[SPEAKER_14]: cigarette, smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_14]: And one morning I was, I just got up and I
went outside and the air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have you ever been in, in, in really hot
climate and you're in the air conditioning
[SPEAKER_14]: and you go outside and at first it feels
good.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, like, ah, I'm getting warm.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I was sitting out there and I had my
Marlboro red and I was smoking it with my
[SPEAKER_14]: cousin, the same age as me and my older
cousin came out and said, Hey man,
[SPEAKER_14]: roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_14]: He threw me a bag, a little bit of a
baggie.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I opened it up and I said,
what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_14]: It was yellow.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it wasn't green at all.
[SPEAKER_14]: There was no green or brown in it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was yellow.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was real Colombian gold.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_07]: Powder?
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it, was it flakes, strings,
chunks, nugs?
[SPEAKER_07]: What would it look like?
[SPEAKER_14]: It didn't look real pretty, but it was
just a color of it and full of seeds,
[SPEAKER_14]: just like the Mexican, but it wasn't real
hard compressed.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like flat buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was busted up, but it had been
pressed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: It had been pressed and they, I guess he
had broken it up, but, and it was only
[SPEAKER_14]: about a gram and a half.
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't very much.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I told him, I said, I don't think
there's a joint here.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he said, bullshit, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: He said, he sat down and rolled a pin
joint.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys know that word, pin joint.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Little tiny, like in the Cheech and Chong
movie.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a toothpick, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that's a joint.
[SPEAKER_14]: But he, we sparked that up and let me tell
you, I got a little bit more, uh,
[SPEAKER_14]: some words, more adjectives to describe
the taste and smell, but this had a
[SPEAKER_14]: cardboard, almost like a cardboard
Coca-Cola.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, and it had a hash taste similar to the
Lebanese blonde.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, it was a really, really different
taste.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I mean, the, the Mexican we got had no
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like, Hey, it tastes like grass,
really grass.
[SPEAKER_07]: That hashingness is why I keep asking
people if they think that there might be
[SPEAKER_07]: Indica.
[SPEAKER_07]: In, in Colombian gold, you know,
Santa Marta, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause that it was very real that it was
hashy.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was heavy.
[SPEAKER_14]: It had a, it had a more, I'll go into that
later because there's a something I'd like
[SPEAKER_14]: to talk about how the, these, uh,
heirloom Colombians, uh, occurred.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe that happened about 150
years ago.
[SPEAKER_14]: They, they weren't indigenous,
but anyway, so we, we, I took one hit off
[SPEAKER_14]: of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is where we get the expression
expando because it got in your lungs and
[SPEAKER_14]: man, you couldn't hold it in.
[SPEAKER_14]: You cough it out, cough it out.
[SPEAKER_14]: And next thing I know, I was higher than
you could I have ever been in my life.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I, my eyes, everything were
trashed and my uncle called and said,
[SPEAKER_14]: we had to go out and cut this pasture.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I said, man, I, I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm too fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to go work now.
[SPEAKER_14]: My cousin was like, come on, smoke some
more.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Power through.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the thing is my uncle took us out in
the middle of nowhere with the tractor on
[SPEAKER_14]: the trailer and, and he gave us a cooler
and I thought there'd be, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: Gatorade or something like that,
but it was Coors Coors beer was before
[SPEAKER_07]: cell phones.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if anything happened, you were walking
back.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to cut your hand off or
something.
[SPEAKER_14]: We drank all that beer and got so drunk,
man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, just absolutely wasted.
[SPEAKER_14]: But by four o'clock, the sun was,
I mean, it was a terrible hangover.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we smoked the rest of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: We didn't finish that little pin joint.
[SPEAKER_14]: We smoked the other half of it at the end
of the day and trashed me again.
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember my uncle, my uncle gave us a
little 38 caliber revolver in case there
[SPEAKER_14]: was a snake or something, you know,
I remember smoking that joint and I was
[SPEAKER_14]: looking at my other cousin going,
you know how to dance boy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: The kids revolver.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kingpin from an early age.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, but that was when I first had good,
good Colombian.
[SPEAKER_14]: There was other Colombian before that that
I tried, but it wasn't like this.
[SPEAKER_14]: This was really different.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe, I do believe that there's
Indica in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally, somebody to agree with me on this
crap that was there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the taste shirt, the taste shirt
suggests it, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: The hash flavor, the hit, the hit was just
boom.
[SPEAKER_07]: And look, I said, remember, I simplified
when I was saying Indica, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't want to, you know,
I mean, wide leaf, Indica hat,
[SPEAKER_07]: all these things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_14]: So remember when, uh, no, uh, in the,
in the late twenties, there were several
[SPEAKER_14]: pharmaceutical companies that came to La
Wahia in Santa Marta and the peninsula of
[SPEAKER_14]: La Wahia.
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of them was Bayer and what they
brought with them, this is all factual.
[SPEAKER_14]: This all really happened.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they brought with them what was called
Indian hemp.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this was Indica from Indica,
India.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there pictures?
[SPEAKER_14]: And after several years, they had
developed one of the strongest cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_14]: producing plants that had ever been
discovered up until then, even better than
[SPEAKER_14]: in, in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the same time, that was right when
marijuana was demonized in the United
[SPEAKER_14]: States and all cannabis medicine was
pulled, you know, they, in the beginning
[SPEAKER_14]: of the thirties, they, they started,
so they all pulled out all these
[SPEAKER_14]: pharmaceutical companies, but the
Campesinos, the Colombians, they kept the
[SPEAKER_14]: seeds and they kept growing it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_14]: And by the late fifties, early sixties,
they had a product that was superior,
[SPEAKER_14]: man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, this shit would knock you on your
ass.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's when they started exporting.
[SPEAKER_07]: What part of the country was the kind of
the epicenter for this?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this, this, from what I understand
was all in on the coast, Santa Marta and
[SPEAKER_14]: La Guajia, which is a peninsula that goes
out, uh, close to Venezuela.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, when I've thrown this out to people
before they said, you know, Santa Marta is
[SPEAKER_07]: an unlikely place for a big pharma company
to go locate an operation like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, they're big businesses do
things big business way.
[SPEAKER_07]: He just started, said it didn't seem to
click right with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: What, what, what do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I believe it's pretty much a fact
and is documented that they were in Santa
[SPEAKER_14]: Marta.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if they actually had,
I don't know if they had the plantations
[SPEAKER_14]: there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me tell you the Santa Marta,
this, this entire Cordella that goes up,
[SPEAKER_14]: it's the highest coastal range in the
world.
[SPEAKER_14]: It goes from sea level up to 20 something
thousand feet snow capped mountains.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a million microclimates there and
it's, it's inaccessible.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's still very remote to go there.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to hike in and everything else.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I can see there and La Guajia,
you know, that's where they were exporting
[SPEAKER_14]: all the gold.
[SPEAKER_14]: They were, they were actually using
tractors to, to farm the cannabis there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's nothing contrasted with
Afghanistan, you know, or India.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, you know, in the climate,
I'm just wondering how, how, how much
[SPEAKER_07]: selection pressure, the difference in the
climate really placed on these foreign
[SPEAKER_07]: strains that they'd brought there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, what, what, what survived,
what thrived in the new, new world,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And how did that turn out looking 20 years
later?
[SPEAKER_07]: And was it by the hand of man or,
you know, what are these things that was
[SPEAKER_07]: it done in two crosses and then sat in a
freezer?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, cause that happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: It does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: From, from my experience of, of growing
here, environments, everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, genetics are a good 50%,
but the other 50% is the environment.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've taken a clone, the same clone and
brought it down 500 meters to a different
[SPEAKER_14]: location to very, very close to the
original, but 500 meters down,
[SPEAKER_14]: totally different plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe it morphology.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it still has, what I, what I did
it with was my, it's a train wreck Panama
[SPEAKER_14]: that I really liked.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I grew a clone in Zipicon and I took
another clone down to Kachupai,
[SPEAKER_14]: which is down in the valley, about 500
meters lower.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the guy grew it for me and we've
compared buds and everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was different, is really different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, did you get to see the difference in
the, the leaf width?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: The, the, no, I really can't say there was
a difference in that, but they were
[SPEAKER_14]: shorter and swatter the higher up it went
and the lower you go down, the more they
[SPEAKER_14]: try to get bigger and bushier.
[SPEAKER_14]: See, I could grow right now at a much
lower elevation and it'd probably be a lot
[SPEAKER_14]: easier, but the pathogens and the insects
are, are, and I don't want to live there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I could.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, that's a big part of it,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why you went down there and everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: It still is.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's quality of life.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm still looking for that perfect,
that just that niche, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: topology is very important.
[SPEAKER_14]: Columbia is like Mexico.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really, really mountainous.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there bamboo or they're like big band?
[SPEAKER_07]: We could build a giant bamboo freaking
like master command center, kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: jutting out of a hillside, all,
all cantilevered and stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: with big, big support beams.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'd have a view of the whole valley
underneath us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the sound of, of, you know,
like bongo drums would be playing in the
[SPEAKER_07]: background nonstop and the smoke would
walk through the air.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But occasionally you'd run into other
kinds.
[SPEAKER_14]: Tie in particular tie stick.
[SPEAKER_14]: I, I never owned a tie stick, but I smoked
a little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was a bunch of good Mexicans,
Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_14]: We used to get real Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was pretty good at first,
a real seedy Brown, but had a,
[SPEAKER_14]: had a really uplifting clean high.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll put a time, put a timestamp on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause you know, when, when was it good?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it wasn't good.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's, can you help us with that?
[SPEAKER_14]: It was good around when I first tried it
around 77.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is better than maybe are equal to good
Colombian.
[SPEAKER_14]: And by 1982, when I returned to the United
States, it was shit, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't, it was all seeds.
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't any good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: 82 and later, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And 82 is when I started really seeing
since the media, the Colombian was pretty
[SPEAKER_14]: much gone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I seem to remember a story about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Colombians started using Jamaica as a
way point for smoke or somebody in South
[SPEAKER_07]: America started using Jamaica as a
stopover point for smuggling powders into
[SPEAKER_07]: the U S and it, and it really changed the,
the whole environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, maybe your supply line of,
of the good stuff from the island was just
[SPEAKER_07]: interrupted and, and that it still existed
there, but you guys just weren't getting
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's always a possibility, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, like I said, I had a very limited,
I, I, I didn't know big, like mad Jag.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't know big people like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just knew people on the street snoozers,
regular guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's high picture it anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't spoil it with any of this.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me tell you a quick, quick story about
bamboo and kachupai.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we going to do, man?
[SPEAKER_07]: Where are kachupai?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's kachupai?
[SPEAKER_14]: Kachupai is lower elevation than Zipicon.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's on the same road.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's on the same.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a Camino Real.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an ancient road, Spanish road.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's out of the, out of the,
below the cloud layer.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is, this is below that cloud layer.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now you're getting down into about 1500
meters where Zipicon is up around 2000
[SPEAKER_14]: meters.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Bogota is 2,700 meters.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's going up.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going up this giant plateau.
[SPEAKER_03]: How far in, preferably in miles,
cause I don't understand kilometers a bit
[SPEAKER_03]: because I'm a dumb American, but how far
from Bogota are you when you're talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about Zipicon from like Bogota miles wide?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, everything's about two hours
distance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: But two hours like driving up a mountain
that's crazy roads or?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, maybe one hour of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: The other, we have really good Autobahn
quality roads here, really highways,
[SPEAKER_14]: super highways.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's when you get into the road that goes
from the main highway down to Zipicon that
[SPEAKER_14]: it starts getting to be like a real
twisty, I mean it's, it's, it's safe,
[SPEAKER_14]: but there's always rock slides and it's
safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just some rock slides.
[SPEAKER_07]: No poison spiders.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there, are there like a lot of poison
spiders down there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause Australia is filled with those
things.
[SPEAKER_14]: So now I got bit by some kind of spider
and Zipicon got sick and went to the
[SPEAKER_14]: doctor.
[SPEAKER_14]: They give me some kind of antihistamine
that almost gave me a heart attack,
[SPEAKER_14]: but no, I never see them very much.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause I'm up in altitude.
[SPEAKER_14]: Where I am, there's no flies, no spiders.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's clean, beautiful, temperate climate.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you met, this guy's got it figured out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the first thing I asked him.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't about the safety.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was how bad are the insects?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm terrified of insects.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can take humans I'm okay with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can deal with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: They suck man.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an army.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're marching the earth right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a plan.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we don't even notice it's
happening around us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause their timeline is just completely
different from humans.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, pretty soon we're all going to
realize, yeah, it's too late.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're also edible.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are edible.
[SPEAKER_14]: They better watch us.
[SPEAKER_14]: But let me tell you this about this
adventure with Ruth.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ruth is my Colombian partner.
[SPEAKER_14]: Business partner.
[SPEAKER_14]: And one day we were going to get bamboo
for the plant supports.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we could tie the plants up with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we go to Cachupine.
[SPEAKER_14]: She starts talking to this guy,
random guy on the street.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's like, yeah, man, I know where the
bamboo is.
[SPEAKER_14]: So he hops in the truck and we start going
down the valley.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he says, keep going, keep going.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're passing this door, passing that
store.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now suddenly we're in the middle of this
giant bamboo grove.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all bamboo.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he jumps.
[SPEAKER_14]: We were looking for a store to buy it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, no man, I'll chop it down for
you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Handpicked only the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: How big was it?
[SPEAKER_07]: How big was it?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just curious what, you know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's not actually bamboo.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's some other plant that's similar to
bamboo that grows here, but it was about
[SPEAKER_14]: that big in diameter.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was about good size tubes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's no joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was a fun adventure because this
guy was like, kept saying, we were going,
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wondered where the hell is this guy
taking us, man?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of where has he taken us,
it seems like you've taken us to Columbia
[SPEAKER_07]: already at this point.
[SPEAKER_07]: How did we get there?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, just timeline in it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I'm going to be chopping things
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are they doing, are they doing big
indoors?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they doing indoor operations down
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: And is that affordable, like kilowatt hour
price?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's available.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason cannabis, foreign cannabis
companies come here is to exploit the
[SPEAKER_14]: people because here the people will work
for a hundred dollars a month.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's a pretty good rate.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the electricity is real cheap here.
[SPEAKER_07]: God, how blind, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, how big, big industry rolls into
the hotbed of cannabis in the world,
[SPEAKER_07]: besides Thailand probably right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they ignore the natural treasure that
lives only there and see it just as
[SPEAKER_07]: another resource pit to be steamrolled.
[SPEAKER_12]: Exploitation.
[SPEAKER_05]: What a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like every commodity.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: But let me tell you what they do.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a big German company, GMW
laboratories right here in Piper.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they have, I don't know if I,
I guess it's about 10 acres of
[SPEAKER_14]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what they do is run non psychoactive
and it's all on hydro hydroponics in
[SPEAKER_14]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's set up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, hold on.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: With hydro in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's non psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's to me, it's hemp, but it's,
yeah, that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like candy down.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Harlequin and ACDC.
[SPEAKER_14]: Harlequin, uh, uh, all the, the,
what's the other one?
[SPEAKER_14]: The Charlotte's web, all those.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: These are, these are ones I don't want to
work with.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't really even like, I had many
of them and I don't really even want to
[SPEAKER_14]: grow any more of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But that, that here's the kicker.
[SPEAKER_14]: When I went there, they're all wanting me
to help them and everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm doing the tour.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm wearing this, this HEPA suit or
something, you know, with all this stuff
[SPEAKER_14]: on.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, and, uh, I really didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they said, okay, here's where we do
our drying.
[SPEAKER_14]: We put it in the drying oven for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this young, young Colombian guy comes
out, he's in this scientist outfit.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I said, what are you doing,
man?
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't you understand?
[SPEAKER_14]: He destroys all those beautiful,
volatile terpenes and things.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he had no concept of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he does.
[SPEAKER_07]: He did after he talked to you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, now, now they've changed and they've
gone to, uh, dry freezing, which I think
[SPEAKER_14]: is a very better change because they're
getting, but it's still non-psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's all sitting in a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_14]: They haven't sold one gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like the, the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming to a gas station near you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I, when I did that big hemp
reversal and got to go out to the big
[SPEAKER_03]: fields and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And see what they did with the end
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was literally tossed in fields of dirt
with goat heads in it, just piled up,
[SPEAKER_03]: not even in crates, just dirt on the dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just had people come scoop it up,
turn it into isolate, move it on biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just, I was mind blown how it was
kept.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even in crates in the dirt,
just in the dirt out in the open fields,
[SPEAKER_03]: just to get everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was gross.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no interest in big, big operations.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to be involved.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to talk to those people.
[SPEAKER_14]: What I enjoy is growing the best that I
can and teaching the young people I know
[SPEAKER_14]: how to do what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a completely different craft in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's a totally different,
they're almost unrelated, except that they
[SPEAKER_03]: happen to work with a similar plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: When you come and see me and you smoke
with me, you'll know the difference.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll see the light.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can tell you, I can draw you pictures,
send you videos, but do you hit that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you hit it with me?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only way to truly tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Matt, I've got a question about the
emerging Colombian commercial scene,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I assume, Red, they're going to start
having dispensaries and stuff pop up and
[SPEAKER_07]: retail, it's going to become a retail
product, fancy packaging and everything
[SPEAKER_07]: like it does everywhere else to fill our
landfills.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Matt, you saw it out in California.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you have some thoughts about the
dispensaries as the kind of taste maker,
[SPEAKER_07]: the opinion shaper in a commercial legal
recreational market like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do people just buy what they're pointed to
when they walk into the store?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And is it all just about looks and nothing
about effect?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: In California, the way I've always seen it
work and I've been to a lot of different
[SPEAKER_03]: places and a lot of different cities,
even in Colorado and Oregon, it's a bud
[SPEAKER_03]: tender who has zero experience or
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, I've never met.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so rare unless it's like a friend
that I've had, like kind of put into a
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary that I know knows their stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's so rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just never really just on occasion
met someone that really knew what they
[SPEAKER_03]: were talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd see, oh, you want a hybrid,
you want to be sleepy, get a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they even going to have anything
though?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, would they even have in their home
a 14, 16 week?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they wouldn't have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way because they'd be paying
too much.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody grows that here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, how does Columbia do it
different?
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of changes could, I mean,
if you had it to do over again,
[SPEAKER_07]: Matt, you've seen it up close and
personal.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, how can it be done differently to,
and this seems like a sidetrack,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I think Red has kind of a vested
interest in this stuff and you've got
[SPEAKER_07]: knowledge and experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I, I don't know that I would be
the right person to ask on how to do it
[SPEAKER_03]: different because I'm such a pessimist,
but I'm interested in Red's opinion on how
[SPEAKER_03]: he would do it different than what he
said.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, first of all, recreational or
personal use is not legal here,
[SPEAKER_14]: but it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can have up to 20 grams of weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just not commercialized, not
regulated, but you can have 20 grams of
[SPEAKER_14]: weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can have five grams of hash legally.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the laws have not changed.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what they consider more than 19 plants
is micro trafficking that you're,
[SPEAKER_14]: you're selling it micro.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think it's going to follow where you
are.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's going to be because they love
California.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're always looking at the laws there.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're always modeling things after up
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is so scary because it just,
it just like what we realized or what I
[SPEAKER_03]: realized really early on being from the
grower side was that the more corporate it
[SPEAKER_03]: got, the more legal or quasi legal it
looked for people to be able to smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: while they're still trying to push through
these like THC percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Max max out type things in the background,
but they made it more illegal or more easy
[SPEAKER_03]: to tax the out of you if you grow and took
the ability for you to produce your own
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine for free at home away from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people like the idea of just being
able to go buy it as an end product more
[SPEAKER_03]: than they like the idea of being able to
grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it just seems like a lot to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the end, I think it's a big loss
forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone to go that route.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, remember, remember too though,
that here it's a lot different.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you can flower year round.
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't have to set up lights.
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't have to put a lot of effort into
growing it like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I, and I don't want to offend.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have more respect for Colombians and
Colombians themselves, but the thing about
[SPEAKER_14]: them is they like fads.
[SPEAKER_14]: They like the, you know, they want to do
what you're doing, you know, they want to
[SPEAKER_14]: do what's going on in New York and stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that a lot of it's, you can go now.
[SPEAKER_14]: They have dispensaries where you can go
and, and you can walk in and buy weed
[SPEAKER_14]: legally.
[SPEAKER_14]: I will not legally, but you know,
you can buy it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can go to any, any, uh, open market
where they have potatoes and corn and you
[SPEAKER_14]: can buy weed there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they get messed with a lot?
[SPEAKER_14]: You just buy the plant and take it home.
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't even break it down.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just jump in the taxi.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've done that many times, hanging out the
window.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did, did, did the, does the police or
government mess with people a lot or try
[SPEAKER_03]: to tax them at that point when they see
it, or how does that work?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, mostly they, they, they get you when
you're, uh, moving, you know, like if you
[SPEAKER_14]: go to a bus station or if you go on a,
uh, taxis cars, that's how they get you.
[SPEAKER_14]: But in your house, they, they,
I've never had anybody come in my house.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, I don't want to get myself in
trouble, but I've grown a lot more than 20
[SPEAKER_14]: plants in my house.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now, I mean, I've had police come in
and say, wow, you have some beautiful
[SPEAKER_14]: plants, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, I hope it changes.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're right now, I don't know if you
know it, but if you look at the news,
[SPEAKER_14]: they're having these big cannabis marches
because they want the new president to
[SPEAKER_14]: sign into law the, what they call adult
use.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's just regulated and they're
pushing him because they want,
[SPEAKER_14]: they want it to be here like it is
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're working real hard together right
now to actually find another fink in the
[SPEAKER_14]: microclimate that I deem as perfect and
getting it all set up.
[SPEAKER_14]: The thing is, is so much with the
regulations and all this money she's
[SPEAKER_14]: having to spend to be able to get the
licensing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we've been working five years,
five years.
[SPEAKER_14]: Five years on this project and well,
yeah, but it's coming together,
[SPEAKER_14]: man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm telling you, I've, I've, I've got the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've, all I gotta do is find the right
place and boom, I'm there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeds now.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if, if, if you've got a place,
a licensed place that can receive them,
[SPEAKER_14]: I can send you, uh, of course I don't have
any Colombian seeds right now,
[SPEAKER_14]: but what I work, my work at the Finca is,
is licensed to sell.
Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, probably got to get you and
Matt down here to help me feminize them.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I can, I can teach.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very easy to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you hear a groaning sound, it's,
it's the internet of people all trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: reach red and Columbia right now to seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to find his web address.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The tubes are being clogged with all the
demand flooding through.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not trying to sell.
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeds really.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not trying to sell anything.
[SPEAKER_14]: I, I, I'm just saying that we are now able
to, to do that legally.
[SPEAKER_07]: You may want to clarify what would be
involved with doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I mean, it's not, you know,
the, the, any 16 year old, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: can take a, can, can go to his car from
high school and order seeds with his cell
[SPEAKER_07]: phone from your website and have it,
you know, with his mom's credit card.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this isn't how it would work,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's you, you're licensed.
[SPEAKER_07]: The receiving party would also have to be
licensed, uh, as a, as a hemp facility in
[SPEAKER_07]: the United States and, and the certificate
of authority, all that stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, uh, it's track.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we have all that.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have all the, and, uh, it's gotta be
below 0.03 THC to import into the United
[SPEAKER_14]: States now.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to say, is this the stuff
that gives you the erection?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it doesn't say that on the label,
but first encounter what you would
[SPEAKER_03]: classify or call either creepy,
creepy.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you pronounce it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Creepy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Creepy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, like with a, in Spanish,
why is spelled with an I creepy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how was it actually spelled down there?
[SPEAKER_14]: C R I P P I.
[SPEAKER_14]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when did you first encounter the,
the creepy?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what happened?
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a pretty interesting story.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was a teacher and a high school in,
in Bogota.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, this was 2012, right at the beginning
of 2012.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I, when I came back in 2011,
I bought a pound of the same good Brown
[SPEAKER_14]: Colombian.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: $20 for the pound.
[SPEAKER_14]: But when I started teaching at the school,
uh, uh, my contact, I still have this guy
[SPEAKER_14]: too.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've known this guy since 2004 or hey,
and get me anything, any kind of drug I
[SPEAKER_14]: want.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, good friend.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: For real.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a good guy though.
[SPEAKER_14]: Really nice mellow guy.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love this guy.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, but I, I called him up, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I said, man, can you bring me a LB?
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you bring me a pound?
[SPEAKER_14]: And he said, Hey, I got something better,
but you can't buy a pound of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have a pound of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I thought, Oh, what is it gold or what
man?
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause he got those before.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, I met him on the street because
my wife, even after all these years,
[SPEAKER_14]: wouldn't let him come in our house,
but I met him on the street.
[SPEAKER_14]: He said, James, it opens up this
newspaper.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like he had it wrapped in newspaper and,
uh, it was creepy.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was seedless since since the media
Indica.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: And not pressed.
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't like it is now.
[SPEAKER_14]: This was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, white widows, what he called it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it looked like white widow.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, it was quite a bit more
expensive, but I, I went ahead and bought
[SPEAKER_14]: it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was about 2000, uh, gram.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: Where the other was 2000 and a half a
pound or 10,000 and a half a pound.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyway, so I bought some and at first
I liked it, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_14]: The next time I got it, he said,
this is skunk.
[SPEAKER_14]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he'd never, he's never heard.
[SPEAKER_14]: He doesn't know these names, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have photos of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Beautiful, dark green with red hairs going
through it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Real flowery smell.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice up high.
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess was skunk.
[SPEAKER_14]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then, uh, I, then it changed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then, then it changed.
[SPEAKER_14]: I started getting it from another guy and
it was these big clumps, like a big,
[SPEAKER_14]: hard clump of compressed or vacuum bagged,
uh, again, Indica, but yeah, seedless,
[SPEAKER_14]: completely seedless.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I guess it was like beasters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, that was the creepy.
[SPEAKER_14]: And pretty soon I didn't like it that
much, although I bought it because I
[SPEAKER_14]: wasn't growing at the time.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I did find one seed.
[SPEAKER_14]: I found a seed in it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Normally I never have found seeds.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you have seeds, you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what year did you first encounter it?
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: When I first saw creepy, it was the
beginning of 2012.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's about the time that I got
those seeds sent up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I wonder if this is the same
guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like it was on Mr. Nice same era.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy, when he sent it to me,
he spelled it creepy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, ah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'd never heard of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then later on, I saw another Colombian
spell it C R I P I.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, Oh my God, maybe the dude
was right.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wasn't just calling you creepy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's very possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a common nickname for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you kind of came across that way in
some of those posts and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: the males might've been in the,
the, the seeds might've been in the mail
[SPEAKER_07]: before he kind of realized, Hey,
this guy's kind of creepy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he said that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's some creepy for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said some creepy things, but creepy is
outdoor grown.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's grown in Columbia, Antiochia,
Calca, even, even up in, uh, near
[SPEAKER_14]: Cartagena.
[SPEAKER_14]: And let me tell you, I don't, I,
I'm naturally against it and don't like
it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because number one, I don't smoke a lot of
Indica.
[SPEAKER_14]: Number two, it's commercial and yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it, it gives me a bad effect,
a negative effect.
[SPEAKER_14]: It does me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But in Cartagena, when I bought a nice
chunk of it, it was excellent,
[SPEAKER_14]: man.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was, it was uplifting.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a really a good, but it looked just
like the other Indica clump, but it had,
[SPEAKER_14]: I was stellar.
[SPEAKER_14]: I brought some back with me from,
uh, Cartagena two years ago.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I also got some in Santa Marta that
was, uh, it wasn't the same as what I had
[SPEAKER_14]: in Cartagena.
[SPEAKER_07]: So real quick, I'm sorry, Matt,
the, um, these guys there, it's
[SPEAKER_07]: industrial.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're, they're, they're growing for
profit.
[SPEAKER_07]: They, you know, what, what, how are they
about chemicals and pesticides and stuff
[SPEAKER_07]: like that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, are you getting a clean product
with this or what is it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Full of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: No flushing either.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it burns black.
[SPEAKER_14]: What a lot of it burns, but now they're
there.
[SPEAKER_14]: It varies.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a bunch of different types of it,
but the real shitty stuff burns black and
[SPEAKER_14]: has a chemi taste and they all use
pesticide chemicals.
[SPEAKER_14]: They have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so would you say, cause I know people
are going to be yelling at me if I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: pin you down on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you say that creepy is something
like, and this is just what I'm hearing
[SPEAKER_03]: you say, but maybe you can tell me if I'm
wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's some sort of commercial, probably
Dutch import type like skunk one or one of
[SPEAKER_03]: those types.
[SPEAKER_03]: And any of them will do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a non-Columbian based Afghani
based type plant grown there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he will do.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Same thing like they did in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: These aren't happy growers that are doing
it.
[SPEAKER_14]: These are people that are hand to mouth.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, they're survival and they don't
even give a fuck about the genetics or
[SPEAKER_14]: anything.
[SPEAKER_14]: By trays of clones, put them out and it's
a, it's cartel weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's getting people that bring you cocaine
and make this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when do you think from people
you've spoken to, when do you think that
[SPEAKER_03]: term creepy first started getting used or?
[SPEAKER_03]: Applied to weed like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, see, I left Columbia in the summer
of 2007 and went back to Georgia.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I left, there wasn't any creepy.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I came back, that's when it was
there and I came back in 2011 and it was
[SPEAKER_14]: there then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know when it happened.
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet it probably happened 2008,
2009.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's, it's some of it's good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of it's bad, but when you live in
Columbia and you smoke, you should be
[SPEAKER_14]: growing your own weed, you know?
[SPEAKER_14]: That's like going to a prostitute when
you're married to Lonnie Anderson,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's who would have popped into my head
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Charo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_14]: I said, you know, I, I don't know if you
want to get into it now, but you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: I lived with Kaiki from Kano Biogen.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been here for three years and also
known as Charlie Garcia.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's his on stage name or something.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm hoping we can send out some good
vibes to him because yeah, I understand.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't talk to him anymore, but my wife
still does.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, he's in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_14]: He was really sick.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what it is, but I hope he's
all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was always super cool to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, um, since I started, he's always been
super cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, even when a lot of people wouldn't
talk to me, he was one of the first people
[SPEAKER_03]: that had a really, what I considered a
larger seed company that, that would talk
[SPEAKER_03]: to me and that was a serious breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully he is doing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe he was the, I believe he was the
first Spanish seed bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there, we were reading a book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know who Isidoro Rodriguez is?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's someone that started Kano Biogen with
Charlie Garcia.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I know, but he wrote books,
um, about like the breeding behind like
[SPEAKER_03]: sandstorm and Jitralt and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I, I, he probably know, I probably
know him with a different name.
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably, probably.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause you know, uh, that's really my,
I was, I've been talking to him since Oh
[SPEAKER_07]: six, at least your parents did not name
you red rider.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are not real names.
[SPEAKER_14]: He, uh, he, uh, well, I mean, I don't
know, uh, like, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: him as Charlie Garcia and Kaiki,
but that's not his name at all.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not his real name.
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course I won't divulge that,
but anyway, uh, he used to send me,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, you might've heard of red snake,
uh, the, the Oaxacan, uh, uh, Punto Rojo
[SPEAKER_14]: cross.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I got better, but that was excellent.
[SPEAKER_14]: But that never got out publicly.
[SPEAKER_14]: He wouldn't sell that or Mestiza,
which, which is another one I really
[SPEAKER_14]: liked.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mestiza.
[SPEAKER_14]: Which one was that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Mestiza is the Oaxacan and Mishima Khan.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Mishima Khan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now how do you spell that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I think you're saying Mestiza with a
T.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that, is that right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is it okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: Mestiza.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I saw that for sale for, I saw that
for sale for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was on the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mestiza was, there was a Mexamalia too
from another company.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was like a Oaxacan Burmese.
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't mean that what you've got is
the same thing as what went on the market
[SPEAKER_07]: though.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause a lot of the stuff like would be
like, uh, whatever he worked cross to like
[SPEAKER_03]: a Malawi, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like to put it into seed market form.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, his, his personal collection would
likely be the, you know, the, can you
[SPEAKER_03]: imagine, can you imagine, can you read
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tuscante.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The old Tuscante.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh five.
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?
[SPEAKER_03]: What else you got?
[SPEAKER_07]: Matt's like the dogs got the scent,
you know, he's going to track that thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, but we did a lot.
[SPEAKER_14]: He brought a lot of stuff with him that we
never got to really finish.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's a bunch of, uh, Mongo Biche that we
were working with.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I can read that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I tell you, Ruth, my partner has
gotten spent so much time with the health,
[SPEAKER_14]: the health department, the agriculture
department, the justice ministry,
[SPEAKER_14]: that she's really well connected with
them.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she knows exactly what's legal and
exactly what's not.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I put a lot of faith in everything she
says.
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course I do what I want to do too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you're different.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a different part of the operation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, it seems to me that if
anybody's going to be successful in this,
[SPEAKER_07]: in the legal cannabis world, you've got to
have somebody in the organization that's
[SPEAKER_07]: focused on that interface with the
regulators, with government, um,
[SPEAKER_07]: and who doesn't, you know, who,
who can actually do that kind of work and
[SPEAKER_07]: be successful with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I mean, some people can,
can do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Other people hate that kind of work and
avoid it at all costs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not pointing any fingers here,
but I think there may be three people here
[SPEAKER_07]: who probably feel that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so it's great that you got that
partner, you know, you complimentary
[SPEAKER_07]: skills teaming up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the visionary.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when you see it, you know how to
do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's, she's handling the part that you're
not good at and you're doing the part
[SPEAKER_07]: she's not.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I, I want to really give a good,
uh, recommendation to her because she,
[SPEAKER_14]: she listens to me and, and, and under,
not just listens to me, but understands.
[SPEAKER_14]: And a lot of people hear you, but they
don't understand you.
[SPEAKER_14]: She understands me.
[SPEAKER_14]: And understands what I want to do and
believes in it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that we feed off of each other like
that, or I feel like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like constant roadblocks and
interruptions to your, to your,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, your dreams, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and those things are, can,
can, um, be demotivating and depressing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of people quit right before they
get to the finish line.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, partnerships are marriages too,
you know, like they really are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like marriages are very important and
communication is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you're in a serious business
relationship with someone, it's like a
[SPEAKER_03]: marriage that you can't just leave because
there's responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all kinds of commitments that you
have to each other, uh, whether financial
[SPEAKER_03]: or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, uh, yeah, it's, you have to take
it serious like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and when one of the partners is just
a complete prick, it's, it's almost
[SPEAKER_03]: unlivable, unmanageable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when someone can actually hear you and
you can communicate with them,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's, that's usually someone you stick
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: For as long as you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying my best, Matt.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't appreciate you bringing out
our dirty laundry here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm really trying.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's mostly what I work with is channel
biology and ACE.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very, very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, are you, are you still close with
Duby?
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, actually not close at all,
but I think the world of him, he's my,
[SPEAKER_14]: my best friend if he ever wanted to be.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love their work.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, he sent me a bunch of seeds one time
and man, I've been growing those ever
[SPEAKER_14]: since he sent them about four years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your favorite from their,
their stock?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Malawi, Malawi, the ACE Malawi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you ever, if you ever come see me or
you, we get together, you'll, you'll try
[SPEAKER_14]: it down here.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's when I want to think when I want to
be inspired, motivated, uh, I smoke that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, have you done it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And have you made any cobs down there from
it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, and I also make the, uh,
you know, I learned this from ICMAG,
[SPEAKER_14]: but I also make, uh, make it with the
Colombians and it brings back that musty
[SPEAKER_14]: earthy.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the only place you find it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were talking about that, that smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, the other day I mentioned,
uh, peat and loam.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Down in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the color changes and it's,
uh, looks just like the old stuff,
[SPEAKER_14]: but no seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you ever wonder how they did it in
bulk?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I mean, how that stuff just
happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you're just s*** stacking it,
like if you're just s*** stacking it,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going to happen naturally,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like some of the inside's going to
naturally ferment on the inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't intentional.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm writing that down.
[SPEAKER_07]: S*** stacking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's some sort of Harry Potter
incantation.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's made of magic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: You remember when I was telling you that
first summer of 76 when I first got high
[SPEAKER_14]: school with Becky, uh, my mother had a
prescription for, uh, Quaaludes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know, I am so jealous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I hear people talk about that,
I am too young to have ever smelled,
[SPEAKER_03]: seen, tasted, experienced Quaaludes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please tell me.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wrote in a pay dryer and the guy said,
get in the dryer.
[SPEAKER_07]: In a laundromat?
[SPEAKER_07]: You got in the dryer?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to figure out what the hell
he was talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, you got in a what?
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the effects of these things is they
kind of made your body into rubber.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it was pretty common for people
to take these things, wreck their car,
[SPEAKER_07]: bounce out of it completely unscratched.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, it was really common.
[SPEAKER_07]: So is that you got in the dryer and took a
tumble and you probably bounced out
[SPEAKER_07]: feeling better than ever, huh?
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember getting sick.
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember falling into a garbage can too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's another story I got to tell you
about Mike.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I don't think I even put this one in
my vintage Colombian, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_14]: there was a dealer named Mike and,
uh, this guy would get all kinds of drugs
[SPEAKER_14]: and different kinds of, uh, uh,
Lombo, Mexican, even Thai, but he,
[SPEAKER_14]: he, he gave us the seven 14s.
[SPEAKER_14]: We were, we were waiting for him to come,
the guy to come with the weed and he said,
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, why don't you try one of these?
[SPEAKER_14]: Roar Roar seven 14.
[SPEAKER_14]: What the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Good deal.
[SPEAKER_14]: One hour later, I'm riding in a pay dryer.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you're the same age as I am.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was, um, as far as timeline,
you know, those things were just about to
[SPEAKER_07]: disappear when I was around a senior in
high school.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, probably the same for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was a thing that happened right
around that end of the era.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where all these bootlegs started showing
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were mostly like Diaz,
like, like, um, what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Valium.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So people wouldn't, people would mix it
with alcohol and just get knocked slam
[SPEAKER_07]: out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd just be one second.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you ever get a bootleg red or so?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: And your mom's well, in the beginning it
was roar.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe those that have been
pharmaceutical and that changed the lemon.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Both of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Both of them were pharmaceutical,
but they were both copied also.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen, I've seen like old shirts with
lemon on them with like, uh, a number next
[SPEAKER_03]: to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven 14.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what it was?
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven 14.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first one, how do you spell roar?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an H in there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we got, and then we got the
Vandrex from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, that's, that's, that's got aspirin
mixed with it or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: It came in little packs like this,
you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's not, okay.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched a special on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The only place in the world you can still
get it is South Africa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say that, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hamilton Morris.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's, he's someone's a grand kid or
something, isn't he?
[SPEAKER_00]: Morris?
[SPEAKER_03]: We all are kind of accepting.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but like a really rich benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we all really are.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Matt.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Matt.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's two.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at that head, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: That only came out of one.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, that's shaped by the tube.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a special shape, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would call it model shape.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, uh, I've got a nice harvest coming up
probably in, uh, late April, May.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's my, I crossed the Malawi with a old
Hayes that I got from Cannibal Jim.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I don't think it's available,
but then I crossed that to my beautiful
[SPEAKER_14]: Santa Marta and, uh, they're growing
outside, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: About a block from here.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I only got two beautiful females,
but that, that should be a good harvest.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if Matt is that look on his
face.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, I wish you could see, I've got the
same look, Matt.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of stupid.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what's that sound look.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, but, but, um, you're probably
wondering, is that old timers Hayes or is
[SPEAKER_07]: that Tom Hill Hayes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Charlie had both or sent you a
picture, another accession.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it looked like, you know, some of the,
the very extreme phenos when you try and
[SPEAKER_07]: grow stuff like that indoors, they have a
very similar structure, but not,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the, the, just looked so healthy
and robust years.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just looked beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grown outdoors like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a, the structure in wars is
really similar.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I know guys with phenos like,
just like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and it's the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see mango beach.
[SPEAKER_03]: A first time you have seen or heard of
mango beach.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, well, of course here they pronounce it
Mongo beach, but, but they, Mongo beach a
[SPEAKER_14]: means a unripe mango.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what Mongo beach a means.
[SPEAKER_14]: They sell it on the street corners,
but some people call it lemon,
[SPEAKER_14]: lemon, lemon, lime, or something.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, uh, not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I really don't like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think it is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it normally the same thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it like stuff that's presented as
mango beach a that's not the same?
[SPEAKER_14]: I can tell you what it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, it's very intersect.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's long flowering, low potency.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, it's hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's unmanageable.
[SPEAKER_14]: It grows into this damn tree.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now that's the ones I've had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of them may be better.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, that's a laundry list of
undesirable traits.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just threw out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that pretty much waves off the
entire world from wanting to pop that
[SPEAKER_04]: pack.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just drop to the bottom of the list.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mongo beach is just like Punta Rojo.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a generalized name.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's many varieties within that name.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, and I didn't grow a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember I got this guy at the national
university in Bogota.
[SPEAKER_14]: This guy that I smoke him with said,
dude, I got these Mongo beach.
[SPEAKER_14]: You got to grow them out.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're excellent.
[SPEAKER_14]: I grew them out.
[SPEAKER_14]: They were all.
[SPEAKER_14]: No,
[SPEAKER_14]: no, no.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've never grown those.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I mean, you know, look,
I mean, we may as well consider these
[SPEAKER_07]: things to be two completely different
things that, you know, the stuff grew and
[SPEAKER_07]: the stuff that the rest of the world may
have access to probably not the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, you know, everything that was
wrong with that mango beach, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: we should assume that the Kenobi agent and
ACE people would have, uh, done their,
[SPEAKER_07]: done their job and, and created less
traits.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I don't know if he still has it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even know if, uh, uh, he's still
selling seeds, but he, he had a Punta Rojo
[SPEAKER_14]: and I know where this Punta Rojo came
from.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, can you talk about that?
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's, it is good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Punta Rojo will tell us this Punta Rojo.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, he came here, uh, I forget.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember what year it was.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was in the 2000, but he came here to
Columbia and he hooked up with his
[SPEAKER_14]: buddies, went to Manizales.
[SPEAKER_14]: Manizales is a really unique place and
elevation and climate and everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, he sourced the, the Punta Rojo
from Manizales or that area, which is
[SPEAKER_14]: also, which is also where the,
uh, wacky weed, some of the wacky weed
[SPEAKER_14]: Manizales black is from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what wacky weed is, is Manizales
black?
[SPEAKER_14]: That's one of them.
[SPEAKER_14]: The original one, I believe to have come
from Calca, the candy bar.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's another story I got to tell you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, uh, the, anyway, getting back to the
Punta Rojo, I've got photos and
[SPEAKER_14]: everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: I grew it in Bogota 2016.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, but you've got to realize when you're,
when you're this, this kind of a plant is
[SPEAKER_14]: different than what you're got.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys, it's not a cruce.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not an OG.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a, this is a, it's potent,
but it's, it doesn't look like it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_14]: There's, you don't see a lot of crystal,
you know, it's not all, all T,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, trichomed up.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a big floral mass.
[SPEAKER_14]: When you open that bud up, when you open
that flower up and start breaking it up,
[SPEAKER_14]: there's these little like sand size
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, but it's not that it's the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course the flavor, all these,
all these variables are in your
[SPEAKER_14]: environment.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you get a lot of it from the
genetics, but if you grow it in guano,
[SPEAKER_14]: you get a different taste.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you grow it in chemical stuff,
you get a different taste, but it is the
[SPEAKER_14]: real deal.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I like it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just don't, I am not growing it right
now, but I definitely going to grow it
[SPEAKER_14]: again because, and I have a bunch of the
good seeds from, from that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I was going to ask Red is,
you know, um, kaki, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: I imagine ACE released multiple versions,
iterations of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe some of them out crossed with
other, other red, uh, South American,
[SPEAKER_07]: Central American sativa.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, just kind of wondering if you have
any more detail where this might fall on
[SPEAKER_07]: that timeline of, of stuff that was
actually released by CBG or ACE.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I believe the Punta Rojo seeds that
I have, and I grew here are the ones that
[SPEAKER_14]: in fact, I know they are because I helped
him package the, the little, what he sells
[SPEAKER_14]: them in.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it's the original.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it a hot, was it a repro?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, what you, what you've got there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they repro seeds?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it, um, you know, I, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure because he had many things
sent from Spain.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, many, many seeds and things were even
had cuts from Spain.
[SPEAKER_14]: He brought cuts.
[SPEAKER_14]: From there.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I believe, I believe these have been
worked.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't believe they're the directly from
the bag that he got the seeds from in
[SPEAKER_14]: Columbia.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they've, they've, because there
was no, when Murphy died, I grew like 12
[SPEAKER_14]: of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: There was true.
[SPEAKER_14]: There was three true males and I don't
know, seven females and they were
[SPEAKER_14]: excellent, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll show you the photos, big tall colas,
single stack colas has this kind of,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, it's like cedar.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's like a wood smell.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not exactly cedar.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's more like a, not pine either.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'd have to smell it, but it's a woody
type, dark wood smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like exactly what we'd expect
from something named Punta Rojo,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's excellent.
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, you know, that just,
it just means red tips, red point.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's another one, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_14]: The, uh, Well, another, there's,
there's ones, you know, about the United
[SPEAKER_14]: States like that Choco Chiba.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Choco is a department is a department on
the Pacific coast and it's, it's not
[SPEAKER_14]: suitable for growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very human.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very jungly.
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe there was people that said that,
but I've never ever heard of cannabis
[SPEAKER_14]: being have been produced there,
but it may be, I mean, it may very well
[SPEAKER_14]: be, but I've never heard it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first time I saw that referenced
was in an old article.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say it was R, but I might be
wrong, but it was an old article on
[SPEAKER_03]: Colombians talking about the very first
Colombians and where they were being
[SPEAKER_03]: pushed out of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, I want to say he didn't say
Choco Chiba.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just called it Chiba Colombian at the
time.
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard that word before here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just said Chiba Colombian.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't know if Chiba was a province
or town or, well, no, that's just a
[SPEAKER_14]: reference for something that's good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, like, uh, uh, what's the other one?
[SPEAKER_14]: That's Primo Chimba Chimba.
[SPEAKER_14]: When, whenever like something's cool,
they'll say, ah, okay, Chimba.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not Chiba Chiba.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard in reference to cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that doesn't even help pin down where
the province could have been in relation
[SPEAKER_03]: to, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now I remember, I think I remember the
article you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was one of those things where R was
just kind of just rattling off this,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, this string of, you know,
the 84, you know, or the 78 Santa Marta
[SPEAKER_07]: was really good, but they had a storm
blowing in and the Reds were like a
[SPEAKER_07]: burgundy, blah, blah, blah from Chiba.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's just, it's almost like name drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: This just came in the mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, it's a prototype for this,
uh, banana OG, but like this guy had it
[SPEAKER_03]: made in Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a vinyl toy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that cool?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to make some toys with me,
but because, because he's bored,
[SPEAKER_07]: he's bored with the rubber ducks that
have, that have filled the ocean.
[SPEAKER_07]: He wants to replace it with little,
it feels like a rubber duck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you could, it makes error out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a rubber duck.
[SPEAKER_14]: Close to area in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]: I got to put them up next to the pole
spike girl right here.

[SPEAKER_05]: Very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's freaky.

[SPEAKER_14]: But again, I find that about Indica's or
most Indica's is how it,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, it was like, it was like,
I was connected with everything around me.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of a sudden I just started questioning
everything I'd ever been told.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, by the time, by the time I got
high that very first time, when it started
[SPEAKER_10]: to hit me and I'm like, wow,
