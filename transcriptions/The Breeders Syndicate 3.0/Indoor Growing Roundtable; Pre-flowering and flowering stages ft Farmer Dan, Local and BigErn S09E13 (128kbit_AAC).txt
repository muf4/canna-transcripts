[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_02]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_02]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_02]: seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_02]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Syndicate is a collection of seed makers
that want to push back against all the
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_02]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am Thousandfold, and tonight I will be
hosting in place of Matt Riot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, we're still without Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last recording, he wasn't well.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has recovered, but he's now got to
clear like a huge backlog of orders and
[SPEAKER_03]: various admin and also edit the last
episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, unfortunately, we will be
without Matt once again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have the youth here again.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have local Farmer Dan, Big Earn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Local and Big Earn, obviously,
from the last Indoor Growers episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Farmer Dan, I'm sure you would have
seen by now.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's also been helping us a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's had to record like three
times in the last week because we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: backed up as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it's been quite the time,
but it's also been really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are unfortunately without Spindle
tonight as well, who is also unwell.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope he feels better soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, today we will be talking about
flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to match the Outdoor
Growers who had their flowering episode
[SPEAKER_03]: last time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to kick us off, I think it was a good
idea by Dan for everyone to just talk a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit about the setup they're working
with in however much detail that you guys
[SPEAKER_03]: want to just so that we can set the scene
a bit for the flowering conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll kick us off right now for my
home setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I do a few plants outside every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for my indoor, I kind of just have a
little four by four tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a little one by four veg,
which I should have gotten bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to keep a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have just like a little AC unit,
like a window ducted one that I cut a hole
[SPEAKER_00]: in the side of it and just kind of mounted
it there and sealed it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I rock a Spider 2P LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the veg side, just a few bar
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really basic, kind of just enough to
get it done and hold on to plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, well, first off, I'm going to
mention it's Halloween.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you guys are crazy, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not like the trick or treaters.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to say, I will say that I forgot
that it would be Halloween for you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for showing up on Halloween.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm dressed as Batman right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just picture that, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so I have like a more kind of
like perpetual kind of setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have like a few different like bar LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm not here to, I wouldn't like
necessarily plug an LED super hard or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my main flowering tent,
I have like a Grover's Choice light in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use some of the like UV bars with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use like the AC Infinity stuff,
you know, just to automate the
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I forgot to mention that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got the same AC Infinity
controller just because it's like so
[SPEAKER_00]: modular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they have like plugs that you can
plug your AC unit into and like your D
[SPEAKER_00]: HOMS and kind of have a lot more control
than you normally would with a Homegrown
[SPEAKER_00]: setup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I currently have a five by five
flower space with a, I think it's an 800
[SPEAKER_04]: watt LED.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what it like draws out the
wall, but that's what it's advertised at.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I typically grow in like one gallon
pots for flower, just to kind of see a
[SPEAKER_04]: number of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like the homie said, some AC Infinity,
like eight inch fans and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_04]: to remove air.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I have some veg closets
throughout the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's pretty much my girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do all of you perpetually flower more or
less?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's kind of working on that now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to, I, you know, like I like to
run through things one time and keep them
[SPEAKER_01]: backed up and then, you know, rerun from
there, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of my, in my like kind of
perpetual thing is just being able to look
[SPEAKER_01]: through stuff because I am still very new
and just kind of, you know, trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out what I like and that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll also mention that I do have like
racks or a rack in my veg space and that
[SPEAKER_04]: helps utilize space.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine's double tier.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to add that just to kind of
give a better picture, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's mandatory if you like
really want to pop seeds and keep backups
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like a two by four tent like
fills up real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That second tier really helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a company that used to sell a
three tiered one that came with its own
[SPEAKER_00]: rack that perfectly fit in the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you didn't have to like line it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really missed the one that I got rid
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have kept that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I don't really like perpetual
very well because of my like limited
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had even just like one more tent,
you know, my house is a little on the
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm lucky that I get to keep what I
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of like don't plan it out
well as well as I should.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I end up like having to veg in the
main space for a decent amount of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you reminded me that we talked about
these like possible idea to have these
[SPEAKER_03]: little isolated, what would you call them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like pollination boxes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like a grow cabinet type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I wanted to like have like a
different flowering chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be very big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm only ever reversing like one thing
at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that could be like two small little
one gallon pots or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to like build a desk that had
like one side for reversals and then like
[SPEAKER_00]: another side where I could like then
immediately take the pollen and dust stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and that I wanted to work with without
sacrificing, you know, a four by four tent
[SPEAKER_00]: and making, you know, you could make a
pound of seed or more in a four by four
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a, yeah, a little overkill for
most of the stuff I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, you know, sell my seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks for, thanks all of you for
letting us kind of have a bit more context
[SPEAKER_03]: for your, your setup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the next thing that I wanted to
prompt just before we dive like right in
[SPEAKER_03]: is what are the first thoughts that come
to mind?
[SPEAKER_03]: When I say like prepare to flip or like
flipping or transition to flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess two things that I really consider
is like the health of your plants and then
[SPEAKER_04]: the size.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like, you don't want to flower
things that are like too big.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I've done that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how many times, but there's
just ends up becoming more of a mess than
[SPEAKER_04]: anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also like flowering a healthy plant is
like your best bet because it's not going
[SPEAKER_04]: to like start starving off the bat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just my opinion though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I tend to kind of do the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I'm like getting ready to like
preparing, like, you know, whatever cross
[SPEAKER_01]: it is that I'm like, I'm going to flower
all of them in one go, or if I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like break it up into multiple
runs, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you start getting some numbers,
it can be a little bit overwhelming as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as like just looking through individual
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of want to know like each plant
individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like a thing that I come,
you know, I always think about was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: how many of these plants can I really do
and like be able to focus my attention on
[SPEAKER_01]: them?
[SPEAKER_04]: Something else too is like, I like to make
sure that those plants are backed up
[SPEAKER_04]: before I flip them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes, you know, I'm not always lucky,
but that's just a, that's a plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started growing, I remember
one time I put a bunch of those five by
[SPEAKER_00]: five veg pots and I gridded them out with
Blue Dream in my tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that plant will put on like an epic
single cola and you'll just have like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a sea of 48 tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of stuff won't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, was I talking to, I think I was
definitely talking to Er and I kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: remember who else was in the conversation,
like just yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we were talking about there being
this threshold in terms of the number of
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, like that each individual can
manage beyond which like they stop
[SPEAKER_03]: becoming, they stop really seeming like
individual plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're just more like a mass,
if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's different for everyone as
well where that threshold is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause obviously that depends on like your
time, energy, you know, resources or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it all depends on like, yeah,
like what you're allowed to do and like
[SPEAKER_00]: what works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it's a, it's always
about just like getting to know your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anyway, but yeah, I like to look at
just like the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I know the variety, like you can kind
of start making some assumptions based on
[SPEAKER_00]: like how it's going to feed and like your
media that you're going to put it in and
[SPEAKER_00]: like what it prefers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like a good base is always just
like a cocoa or a soil run and yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: two or three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you don't have to do like the one
giant 20 gallon pot in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen other people do that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never quite understood it,
but, um, I did have a quick question for
[SPEAKER_04]: you, Dan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, when you did the, the single Cola blue
dreams, uh, like sea of green,
[SPEAKER_04]: did you find that that like yielded as
much as like, you know, a couple fully
[SPEAKER_04]: grown three gallon pots?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or like, what was the yield like?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like just slightly lower,
I think, but it was all tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was like nicer, you know,
and at that time, like a lot of people did
[SPEAKER_00]: like a lot of like Scrog and sea of green
style plantings with like hydro and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, it was like more common.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like at that point than it is now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I would try to do that again,
but it's just so hard when you don't have
[SPEAKER_04]: like a single variety to run at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, this was one clone on a flood
tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like pretty, pretty automated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like two for, I've,
uh, done a four by eight with,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, I dunno, like 13 different varieties
at one time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just like, it wasn't like hard,
but it was just good enough to get like,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, I want to say like an okay
representation of what things can be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I dunno.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it wasn't my strongest grow,
but it was nice to see a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I kind of do with my home
stuff is just like looking through
[SPEAKER_00]: different populations and trying to find
cool plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, I'm always kind of trying to
like min max what I can fit for like the
[SPEAKER_00]: effort and to get the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, it's a challenge sometimes
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set myself up for failure last time and
I put like, I dunno, it was like 16,
[SPEAKER_00]: three gallons and they were just like edge
to edge and it was just like a mess by the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't actually like any of it either.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, so this is my first time actually
growing out of like three gallon cocoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like fucking mind blown at how
massive the fucking buds get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I like flowered strictly in once and
like in once I could get pretty sizable
[SPEAKER_04]: buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but man, the threes, I'm just like,
holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, man, should I switch over?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know, but I kind of just
like to pop a bunch of seeds and it,
[SPEAKER_04]: the ones kind of just see suit my model
the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For like the veg space I have to keeping
any like moms, even in three gallons,
[SPEAKER_00]: it cuts me down like super, super limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, um, you know, it's just,
yeah, it can just be a challenge on those
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger pots, but it's so much more work
when you're having to water twice a day in
[SPEAKER_00]: a one gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's a, it's, I need to set
up an irrigation system off also like that
[SPEAKER_00]: would make my life so much easier if I
just had a five gallon bucket or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that outside the tent, just plumbed
in like super basic on a sump or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it probably, it wouldn't be very
accurate as far as like water distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: in each pot, but, um, it would make my
life a whole lot easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: It helps keep them alive, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can focus on other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, even I guess, I could just have it on
a backup and just have it at like 24 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, and just have it do,
you know, like a, a really quick water,
[SPEAKER_00]: just so nothing dies if I miss something,
but you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally have like, it just kind of
sucks always being tied down to the house,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing to me, like how stress,
how stressful it is to even plan like a
[SPEAKER_03]: few days away now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I feel, I really feel bad for
the fucking plant sitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like, I have a bunch of solos,
like one gallon pots and flour and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, Oh my God, like their life
is about to be hell for an entire week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, you always notice when you come
back, they're not, they're not very happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was, dude, I was really stoked to see
this, uh, ended haze cause it was looking
[SPEAKER_04]: really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I come back and like,
there's just like deficiencies and I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: just like, Oh man, like it doesn't look
terrible, but it could have been better.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could have gone better, but here nor
there, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the only reason I brought like all
this up was cause I feel like it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like leads into the next topic thousand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it definitely does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And well, you know, like, like with any of
these topics, we'll end up looping back
[SPEAKER_03]: inevitably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess in terms of like drilling into
various aspects of the growth that you
[SPEAKER_03]: might be thinking of when you are
preparing to flip, um, obviously already
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned some of these things,
but, um, could talk about, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: any training that you do before,
before flip any, like what kind of feed
[SPEAKER_03]: changes you're preparing to do,
you know, lights, IPM, any of that really,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, open to anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I've done a lot of different
things, you know, like I feel like trellis
[SPEAKER_00]: in the end is the way to go, even on like
a four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it just limits access and movement so
much that I like avoid doing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it's so fucking helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause it just makes everything fixed
at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're kind of crawling on your
hands and knees, trying to get little
[SPEAKER_00]: scoops of water to the right plants and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like I've, I've been worried about
getting older and having to like crawl
[SPEAKER_03]: around and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm starting to do, I'm starting to worry
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to a certain degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've already got my own like,
you know, uh, orthopedic injuries and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, like I have a bad
shoulder and a bad knee already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, it definitely makes it more
complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I kind of still stick with
like stakes, even though like I've almost
[SPEAKER_00]: lost an eye a few times to like bamboo and
plastic stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, it just like lets me be able
to move plants out and uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like pull a plant out to do deletion and
stuff, instead of trying to like work in
[SPEAKER_00]: that cramped space in the tent,
even though at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I would just love to have a trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, yeah, that's, that's kind of
what I was thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, so like, I kind of have a little bit of
a process down at this point where I will
[SPEAKER_01]: like, uh, try to get like a good apical
cutting off of my seed mom that I can root
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, then I have this plant
that's like essentially topped and like
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to kind of be like trained out and
flowered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's kind of what I've been
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I'll, you know, I have this plant
that's topped, it's got two main tops and
[SPEAKER_01]: then I'll use just like some clips in on
the side of the pot and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: wire and just like kind of spread the
plants out just a little bit at the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then later on I'll, I'll end up
using like bamboo stakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for the reasons that Dan is
mentioning, like I, trellis is really nice
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as like getting like a super even
canopy goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's probably like probably the
best way, you know, I mean, it's like a
[SPEAKER_01]: grit at the same level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's just so tough for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I'm in a five by five,
um, I have mine like sitting in the corner
[SPEAKER_01]: of my basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the back right corner of my tent is
like really hard to get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, so I take my plants out and
hand water them and do all that stuff so I
[SPEAKER_01]: can look at them and, you know,
de-leaf and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as much as I like things about trellis,
it just makes it so hard to do everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, that's kind of like what I'm,
I'm kind of just thinking about like what
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like my plan to be super healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I want the roots to look good and I
just want to feel confident about flipping
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're going into like ahead of the
game.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get a bunch of trick or treaters
right then?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dog is going at these people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It adds some festive, you know,
vibes to the episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very festive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I pretty much just like top my
plants a little bit before flower and then
[SPEAKER_04]: flip them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, nothing really out of the
ordinary.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about like, um, how about in terms of
like other things, I imagine by this
[SPEAKER_03]: point, you know, your IPM, if you were
doing any, you know, needed to have been,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, how am I, what am I saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, like by the time you get to
flower, you shouldn't be doing any more
[SPEAKER_03]: IPM, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like all that stuff should have happened
up until this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what about, what about like feeding
during flip?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We may even move into, into the actual
like a first few weeks of flowering now
[SPEAKER_03]: then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, well, I kind of don't spray
anything during flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, um, I don't release beneficials
either, even though I should, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: like nematodes, um, and other beneficial
minds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but that gets expensive and yeah,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what do you do for your prep?
[SPEAKER_00]: And veg just to keep everything clean
before you get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so like, honestly, I'm a huge user of
fucking a self oil X dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's, it's just like, it gets
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it just sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you can't drench it obviously,
but like, I mean, other than that,
[SPEAKER_04]: like it gets all soft bodied insects,
which is like 99% of the problems that
[SPEAKER_04]: people run.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never really had a PM issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but people say that you can use it for
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but, um, yeah, I've used like a grand
Devo in the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, regalia I've had like Pyganic 5.0,
but that shit is fucking ridiculously
[SPEAKER_04]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that shit you just listed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason why I like get self oil is
because it's like $80.
[SPEAKER_04]: For like two and a half gallons and like
that'll last you forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just had like issues finding like a
good dilution, but like I didn't stick
[SPEAKER_00]: with the stuff oil very long because cause
I was like, well, I already knew all these
[SPEAKER_00]: other things that like I had tried and
worked for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so like I try, I try to do like enzyme
sprays early on, like a newcomer at Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zimes and then like a few weeks before
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if we're looking at like, I don't
know, like a six week timeframe from
[SPEAKER_00]: sprouting a seed to flipping it,
maybe a little longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll save like those last like two or
three weeks and two sprays and I'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: some sulfur on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micronized sulfur.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I've tried to use like,
um, fucking new com or Dr. Zines,
[SPEAKER_04]: but every time it's just like led to phyto
toxicity, like even at their lowest
[SPEAKER_04]: dosage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's just, you can't wait any light
on it at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's, it's, it's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I kind of just like use the oil and my
plants look way happy after it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had some spider mites issues in my
nursery earlier this year and I spoke to
[SPEAKER_03]: local about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and mineral oil spray did actually
work out pretty well for me, just using it
[SPEAKER_03]: regularly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, which I was grateful for, cause I
know, I know spider mites can get really
[SPEAKER_03]: out of hand really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be using a shot back to clean
them off your buds at the end at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point, you know, when they get real wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I actually, you guys are kind of
convincing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of want to go back and try it now,
but I always like try to do a few
[SPEAKER_00]: different things, just like mix mode of
action and like the oils, same thing as
[SPEAKER_00]: the enzymes kind of limit you on like what
else you can use.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's an interesting point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of why I got like some of the
venerate stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I was like, you know, like,
I mean, well, I guess the way I think of
[SPEAKER_04]: it is like the sulfur is like,
or not sulfur, the self oil X or it's
[SPEAKER_04]: horticulture oil, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, in any instance, um, like no bug can
really gain adaptability.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like, you're literally like
suffocating it by like clogging its pores
[SPEAKER_04]: with the oils.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, you're not going to gain a
resistance, but like, I still do want like
[SPEAKER_04]: a mode of action to get things that maybe
didn't get hit the first time or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's just practice, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think diversity of tactics is always
good for this kind of totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think like the limiting like factor
for a lot of people is like money is,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, IPM is fucking expensive, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I guess like, yeah, it's,
it's, it is expensive, but it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say like, the reality
of it is, it's like, if you're taking cuts
[SPEAKER_04]: in or anything like that, it's like,
you're going to have to like have an IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like if people listening like kind
of don't know what we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more just that like a different
phrase will have a different mode of
[SPEAKER_00]: action of how they're killing insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like with the mineral oil example
of the horticultural oil, um, bugs breathe
[SPEAKER_00]: through small pores on their abdomen and
not out of their mouths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you cover that in oil,
they can't breathe and they suffocate and
[SPEAKER_00]: die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hence like the suffix oil, whereas like
there are other sprays that have like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, an active component that's a
neurotoxin or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that nature, or like the enzyme sprays do
really well at literally like dissolving
[SPEAKER_00]: their exoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, yeah, there's a bunch of
different ways to attack the same bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, some are more effective than
others.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the strategy for light lighting,
um, when you're, when you're flipping for
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I kind of run my light,
um, at 80% and then kind of maybe I'll go
[SPEAKER_04]: to 90, but a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like way too intense in my opinion,
but that 80 to 90 range is like kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: where I'd like to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really fuck around with lighting
too much like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use my, um, I use that app on,
uh, iPhone photon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like just kind of get like a general
idea of where my lighting is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, uh, I'm not going to set
speak to its accuracy as far as like
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to a, um, actual like,
you know, par meter, um, because I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have a par meter, uh, and I'm not going to
spend $500, uh, to get like kind of pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: much want to buy Bruce Bugby's light
meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not particularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they're going to go after you in the
comments again, bro.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just, I'll just say real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: $500.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll apologize to Bruce Bugby right now
and just say, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unnecessary stray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use the, um, the photon.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a guy that I used to watch on
YouTube that does some like white reviews
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff, um, that has done a side by
side comparisons of the app with the par
[SPEAKER_01]: meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, it was close enough that
I felt comfortable to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so I use that and just kind of get
myself into like a decent range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I kind of like to, um, I don't want to
be coming in cooking on the lights at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning of flower because I want to have
some like room to go as plants start to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, stretch and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I do kind of like to be on like the
lower end of where I want to be to start
[SPEAKER_01]: just so I have, you know, some room to
increase through flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'll also mention just cause there was
a saying that he'll like gradually
[SPEAKER_04]: increase the lighter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but, um, I'll raise my light to like
the absolute like highest it can be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: like height wise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then I'll increase the intensity
to like 80 to 90%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not like there it's right up on
them or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give like a little context into like
the commercial side of it, whereas a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of commercial grow rooms kind of hang out
around six 50 to 750.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micro moles of light, the canopy height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, a lot of these lights will push
2000 if you have it dropped right on top
[SPEAKER_00]: of your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like one of the things I was
thinking about is like a newer grower who
[SPEAKER_00]: just got a light for the first time and
doesn't really have any experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you're kind of stuck with trial and
error to see like what the plants you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with will like that's coming out
of that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't actually know about this app
that earn was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to have to check that out
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because I think that can be really
useful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'll also mentioned too, like,
um, I'm a pretty recent led grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to grow a lot under CMH.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I've noticed that led kind of has
its own like set of nutritional problems
[SPEAKER_04]: that doesn't particularly come with CMH.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I found CMH plants to kind of just
always look healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's no weird like discoloration
in the leaf or any of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's just been my observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but what did you find was like
lacking?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it just, uh, it kind of always like
seem to be either like magnesium or
[SPEAKER_04]: potassium or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what I've seen too is like
some potassium sulfate helps a lot with
[SPEAKER_00]: that led stress, like the red stems and
the, the kind of yellowing of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's like something that I don't
have at the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like anything to manipulate potassium
independently.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like, that would fucking help a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we were actually like just talking
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually going to say, I actually,
I actually just started using that,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, just like a fat potassium supplement
from, um, nectar for the gods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I can't remember the name of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter who it came from,
but it's a potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah, I think it seems to,
like I did a foliar spray in early flower
[SPEAKER_01]: on these banana haze plants that I'm
growing because one of them stretched like
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty hard and just had some,
I mean, it didn't look like, it just
[SPEAKER_01]: looked like they're on the edge of
underfed kind of, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, it's like, you look at it and
you're like, this plant doesn't look like
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible, but it doesn't look bad
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried that and it does seem to be
helping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and now I've just been using it like,
and it's like, uh, just mixing it in with
[SPEAKER_01]: my feed, like once a, once a week or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to have not that issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, I, I think, but I think like
I started with LAD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never had that, that learning curve
coming, you know, uh, like from,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I just think like, I think that like,
I feel like I haven't ran into some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these problems and it's not necessarily
because I'm like good or anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that or better than anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just because like I, that's where I
started and like, I got rid of those
[SPEAKER_01]: issues quickly or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else about feeding then since
we're also touching on that a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I guess with feeding, like,
especially if you're early on like going
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting like a basic like three or
four part program is, um, not a bad thing
[SPEAKER_00]: at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're going to be so much happier
with the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you try and like reinvent the
wheel, cause you can piece it together a
[SPEAKER_00]: little cheaper and make stock solutions
and do all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the effort, like you're probably
going to have a steeper learning curve,
[SPEAKER_00]: learning how to like formulate a recipe
more than just even learning to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, I know a lot of the guys on
here like to rock candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I've used can in the past and I
really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I kind of like something a little
simpler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I've been rocking cutting edge
again, cause that's what I started out
[SPEAKER_00]: with earlier on and used to grow really
nice weed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've just kind of added a few
organic supplements along the way to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the Terp T for roots organic is a
nice, like dry amendment powder just to
[SPEAKER_00]: give a nice little boost here and there
and, uh, kind of diversify what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: offering the plant so it can do its thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I've grown a few different with a
few different nutrients with the cocoa
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, like I've done the, the Lucas,
like the two part, like with, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: added, added Epsom salts.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my water is pretty high in calcium.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like Cal Mag was never really like a
solution to any of my fucking problems
[SPEAKER_04]: ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but it was like a quote unquote Lucas
modified, you know, type of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I've done like the math.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maxi bloom, um, Lucas style thing,
like with, uh, seven and a half grams of
[SPEAKER_04]: like maxi bloom to one gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that works the same as Lucas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the only downfall is it's a bitch to
fucking dissolve, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like even with hot water, you're
struggling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I've done the Jack's three to one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'll say like, you'll get really nice
sizable plants, but like the issue with it
[SPEAKER_04]: is it doesn't work for all strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it won't work for something like a
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it, it, I've seen like fucking like
Cushman's and all that kind of stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: like crush under that kind of Jack's three
to one, like 3.0 EC kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, canna, um, I've liked it, but I'll be
a hundred percent honest, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the Lucas formula kind of just like
gives the nicest average for the amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: like money that you put in, um,
of everything I've tried so far with
[SPEAKER_04]: cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've done general hydro three part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done like, you know, several
different like nutrient lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did, you know, I, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think like, if you get like a decent
nutrient program, you're, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part, you know, I mean,
um, I do try to think about like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed like with canna, um,
like my, my water comes out like very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very soft, like 10 PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I, I do use some cow mag,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but if I mix like, if I mix like full
shrink flour notes with can't,
[SPEAKER_01]: with, you know, uh, some cow mag and that
kind of stuff, you know, quickly you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting up into this like two and a half,
three C range where I don't really want to
[SPEAKER_01]: be feeding like super hot like that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I've been trying to just kind of
break my feedings up a little bit and
[SPEAKER_01]: like, kind of like do, do like,
you know, like canna one day and then on
[SPEAKER_01]: the next watering do, um, you know,
some cow mag and like the potassium and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that kind of thing, just kind of
trying to break it up a little bit and
[SPEAKER_01]: just, I, you know, I'm still very much
just trying to find like, uh, where I like
[SPEAKER_01]: to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one of these things that the dudes at
the grow shop I used to work out,
[SPEAKER_00]: I always used to say when I was like first
learning about things is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it all works, Dan, like it's a,
it's about what's cheapest, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, I've actually grown pretty
good weed with just like 20, 20,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20, and then zero 50, 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would foliar spray sea green,
which is like a fish hydrolysate,
[SPEAKER_00]: like compost tea extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, as long as you have like good
soil, it's makes life a whole lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: forgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like something I'm relearning with
like pro mix and like more inert hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: style peat medias and with cocoa is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having like a really well blended,
like a, um, Royal gold makes really good
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like what I'm thinking of
and, uh, forest floor organics up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Eugene, Oregon, or they're just South of
Eugene, but they make really great soil
[SPEAKER_00]: with a byproduct from the logging industry
up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, they, it's all composted really
nicely in their yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I've noticed that not using that,
I grow way dumpier weed kind of regardless
[SPEAKER_00]: of the, uh, the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so having a really nice soil blend can
help make your life a lot easier,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially earlier on before you've got
your whole system dialed and before,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, you really get to know what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to come back to feeding tactics at
like distinct points of flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think, uh, if we can like,
maybe you just wrap up this little bit on
[SPEAKER_03]: like general thoughts on like,
uh, the transition and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so other questions I had were like,
how do you all deal with like managing
[SPEAKER_03]: humidity airflow?
[SPEAKER_03]: How much cleaning up is happening around
the stretch?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, are you pruning, defoliating much
lollipopping all that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've done it a bunch of different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I used to do the lollipop style
because even with like a room kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stacked with Gavitas, like it just
doesn't, you don't really get amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: light penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I feel like I was leaving a lot
of weight on the table by stripping really
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily up to the first trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, the kind of the style I'm more
going for now is a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliating, but consistently to maintain
that light penetration all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't really go hard on default.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of just like every time I'm
checking in, I take a few leaves here or
[SPEAKER_00]: there for kind of just open up certain
flowering spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of tend to do the same thing as far
as defoliation goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I'm, I take, like I said,
like, um, I'm in three gallon cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I water like hand water,
take them out, set them on my bench and
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I'll take them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like during flower, I'm watering sometimes
daily, maybe every other day, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'll take these plants out and like,
just kind of go through and just look and
[SPEAKER_01]: like, if there's stuff that like is
blocking or like looks like it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: getting that much light, I'll,
you know, I'll remove it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not like lollipopping, but I do remove
some of the like lower buds and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: just that I know we're going to end up
being just like, you know, kind of goofy
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff that like, I don't really want
to mess with anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll get rid of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then otherwise I kind of just try to
leave them alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like leaving like a very kind of certain
like, uh, ratio, I guess of like laughing
[SPEAKER_03]: or popcorn and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the bottom, just because like,
that's the stuff that I'll just quick dry
[SPEAKER_03]: and like get to use as samples early on,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'll like, so I wouldn't say like I
lollipop my plants particularly because
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know, I don't get them like
that, like fucking wide or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, cause like I crowd my tent with like
one gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I kind of just strip all the lower
stuff and like, let them like shoot up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of like out wide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah, other than that,
like there's no specific like shape that I
[SPEAKER_04]: go for other than like making sure they're
not bumping into each other and stuff like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the one thing I've noticed with LEDs
is like the light penetration with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is nice to get some of that larvae
stuff, but I'm kind of on you with that
[SPEAKER_04]: one thousand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't like like pick it out
particularly cause I do like to smoke it
[SPEAKER_04]: early on and I am a little lazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and like what some people do,
especially like outdoor growers and
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse guys, like if you have the
ability to and the space and no
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions about it is, um, a lot of
people will take tops and like kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: take the top half of the plant and then
leave the lowers for another like week to
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 days to let them firm up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, um, especially outdoor on
like larger plants, that's like really key
[SPEAKER_00]: because that interior canopy is never
quite as done as those top extremities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, and I know you were asking about
like feeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so one thing like I've noticed with a
lot of plants is like, you can kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: continue that like same veg diet all the
way through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then there's some that'll take
like a full strength veg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then you like try to apply that
into flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've noticed some of them will like
show like some nitrogen toxicity,
[SPEAKER_04]: like a little bit of clawing on like the
new growth and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'll just kind of subtract from
like the part that contains a little more
[SPEAKER_04]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but other than that, like it's kind of
like, it's, it's hard to know when you
[SPEAKER_04]: like pop seeds and you're throwing them
into flower the first time, but like the
[SPEAKER_04]: second go, yeah, the second go around and
like, that's when you can kind of make
[SPEAKER_04]: your tweaks and kind of adjust each,
um, individual like, um, formula and shit
[SPEAKER_04]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it makes sense because it's like,
you can't really play catch up in flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, just quickly, I think you all
mentioned this already when you were
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about your setups, but,
uh, humidity control, uh, ACs
[SPEAKER_03]: dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I'll, I'll have my AC running like
all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I like to get like cooler nighttime
temps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but like in terms of like humidity and
stuff, since I have like the AC running,
[SPEAKER_04]: it does get a little cool and dry,
but I'll also have like fan, like the
[SPEAKER_04]: small, like, um, not like, uh,
desktop fans, but they're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, 12 inch fans, some like that
14 inch, like on the front floor and then
[SPEAKER_04]: the back floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then they'll move air on the
floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I have some strap to the top of
the tent, like right at the entrance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but that's really it for air movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have just like a small dehum,
um, inside the tent that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, luckily nowadays there's actually
small dehus that actually work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they didn't used to be that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like when I first started growing,
even if you had a four by four tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you kind of had to figure out how to
work in this, you know, like two foot tall
[SPEAKER_00]: by like a foot wide, by like eight to 10
inches, like this just big unit,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost the size of a small AC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you had to just like cram in the
tent with it, you know, or else you just
[SPEAKER_00]: had like no real control over that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question here about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in my mind, I thought it would be
somehow, I don't know if more effective is
[SPEAKER_03]: the right term, but I thought that like,
it was the lung room that should be
[SPEAKER_03]: dehumidified, not the like inside space
because that space is, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: having air kind of going like passing
through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so mine's kind of set up on a timed
exhaust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, I'm not always exhausting,
but it's set up on a timer to where it
[SPEAKER_00]: does it like once an hour, um,
for like 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then I have my AC kind of like
blowing, like pulling from my lung room,
[SPEAKER_00]: which just my office, you know,
um, and that's kind of influxing cooler,
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, refresh in there a little
more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you think about it with your AC,
um, unless your whole room is AC that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of just depends on where you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when I used to live on the coast,
we didn't need AC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just pulled in that 65 degree air from
outside and at night it goes down to like
[SPEAKER_00]: 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that air was always really humid,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that just meant more dehumbs that you
need, but you don't have AC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily ACs act as dehumidifiers all on
their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, a lot of people, especially in
like California where it's drier for a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the year, you can get by without a dehu
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was going to say, I use, um,
like as far as like the lung room kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: situation is it's my basement,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I just want my basement to be
generally dry, uh, being like a good house
[SPEAKER_01]: owner kind of thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, so, uh, I do have like a,
some of those like portable, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: ACs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but really, I only use one of them
most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have a hose hooked up to it and I'll
run it in dry mode and just let it,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, dehumidify constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because like this year, uh,
like until today, actually it's cold now,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, it's been like 85% humidity here,
like all summer, it seems like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, I mean, it's been a, even to just
get me, get me down to like 60% humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: is about as far as I've been able to get
just with this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but now that it's getting cold and
stuff, I won't need to run dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just run an air conditioner in my
basement, you know, just for it to be like
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I have two of those,
um, like hurricane, like oscillating fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have those like mounted, just like
moving air around in my basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted us to move into kind of looking
more at the progression of the different
[SPEAKER_03]: stages of flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I had a thought, which is just before
we do that, I wanted to ask Dan,
[SPEAKER_03]: if there was like any notable differences
when he thinks about this for work,
[SPEAKER_03]: or, you know, at the facility versus
thinking about it at home, even on like a
[SPEAKER_03]: broad level, like what are the major
things that are different that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: jump out to you, Dan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, the major thing at scale is
just cost, you know, like I can't afford
[SPEAKER_00]: to buy anything liquid, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like that just means like stock tanks
and direct injection for like fertigation
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stuff like an Argus or a Privia or
even just some Dosatrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so it's just kind of a completely
different realm as far as that goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: because like most people are just running
like either a custom blend or a purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: blend of salt fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but like at home, um, I used to have
like a whole thing when I was like doing
[SPEAKER_00]: more organics where I'm like, all right,
I'm going to like feed seaweed until this
[SPEAKER_00]: date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to top dress with um,
you know, like worm castings like once a
[SPEAKER_00]: week for those two first two weeks of
flower and like get a bloom powder in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, I had this whole progression
and like it grew nice weed, but like now
[SPEAKER_00]: looking back, I feel like it's pretty
excessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, I think the one thing that
might be like a tidbit that goes against
[SPEAKER_00]: like common bro knowledge is that the
phosphorus intake that your plant wants is
[SPEAKER_00]: they needed immediately starting in
flower, you know, which means that you
[SPEAKER_00]: probably needed to water it in like a week
before you flip and get those levels up
[SPEAKER_00]: within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, traditional knowledge is more
like push phosphorus and potassium at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of flower for like the last four
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never really understood the
thought behind that, because like,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you think about a plant that's
flowering, it's doing this massive amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of cell division at each node.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those cells all just like expand
with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not really exactly sure what
like a huge phosphorus or potassium dose
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end really does besides just like
make your flower super dense, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the original point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think to facilitate it, it's much
better to do it like right around the
[SPEAKER_00]: transition time and keep that going for
the first week or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can kind of go on a more base
feed from that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've not heard that before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely a new thing for me to
think about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well, you kind of, you kind of got us
started there, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So in your mind, what are like the
distinct, you know, not distinct,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, you know, what are the loose stages
of flowering?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, obviously in the stretch,
that's quite an obvious one.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you all see like the flowering,
the entire process kind of being divided
[SPEAKER_03]: loosely?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's just cell division and
expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's like, yeah, weeks one
through three, while the plants elongating
[SPEAKER_00]: the, you see those flowers forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that, it's kind of just like,
I like to just get out the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and kind of let it do its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't really have any secret
sauce for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides like setting the plan up to be
able to sprint when the time comes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in terms of what about the rest of
you, like in terms of feeding at these
[SPEAKER_03]: different junctions, like what's changing
or like any, any of those other
[SPEAKER_03]: parameters, feeding, uh, lights,
you know, what's changing in the course of
[SPEAKER_03]: like flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I'll just mention that like,
my diet doesn't really like the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the way I feed my plants,
like their diet isn't particularly like
[SPEAKER_04]: changing a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm still keeping the same formula,
the same ratios and stuff that like Hannah
[SPEAKER_04]: provides.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's just like, sometimes I noticed
like a little bit of nitrogen toxicity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll back off on one part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but like, other than that,
like I'll keep the feed the same all the
[SPEAKER_04]: way through.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like the one thing I've noticed is
like, they don't like have a potassium
[SPEAKER_04]: supplement that's separate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, since I already add
potassium phosphate, um, it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to add the PK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I need to add some K, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, other than that, like there's no
specific like diets.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm not like really ramping up P or K
at any specific time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I just want to add enough to kind of
like, kind of compensate for the addition
[SPEAKER_04]: of like phosphorus in my medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so with Kana, I'm not like as
familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have you like a week to week
recipe chart where they're kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: changing and shifting ratios, or do they
just have like a bloom like rate to use?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of like you maintain your
one-to-one usage of A and B, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you'll notice like as a flowering
progresses, you'll kind of up that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, up until like, I don't know,
like maybe week six to seven and then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the Kana formula is based off of
like eight to nine week plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it, uh, looking at it, it's like
around like week four or five,
[SPEAKER_01]: they is when you're hitting like the
highest amount of feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you're kind of coming in,
I use like, I'm using the PK booster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, they recommend just to see,
cause I haven't used it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just kind of didn't want to see if it
was going to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it kind of ramps up to somewhere
around like 1.8 EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's like around like week
five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it kind of just starts,
it kind of comes down a little bit and
[SPEAKER_01]: then to about like 1.2 EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it stays there until,
um, you know, until you finish or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you guys ever played around?
[SPEAKER_00]: With like any different, um, like bloom
booster, quote unquote.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't mean just like a straight PK,
but there's like products like advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, overdrive or house and garden
shooting powder, um, that I've noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: after using them a few times in like
commercial capacities that they kind of do
[SPEAKER_00]: have something in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea what it is, um,
that you can kind of reestablish an
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier flower set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it lets it basically, you see the
plant shoot a bunch of white hairs again,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it was already kind of starting to
die back and senesce a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they used to recommend it in like week
seven, but I think they've changed that to
[SPEAKER_00]: like five or six now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's kind of how people used to
use it and recommend to use it,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, before they changed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like I worked for the company that
had the license to distribute house and
[SPEAKER_00]: garden in the, in the U S back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, it's just funny how things
change like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But have you guys ever used anything like
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I used, uh, the one that general hydro
makes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has like a sunflower on the front of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's like, uh, I'll look at the name
really quick, but it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it had, it's like a right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to fuck with that stuff a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's such a good man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, it's, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's a point where you can be
using all these different inputs and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just tough to tell like what's doing what
for me sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yes, I did use it, but like when I
was using it, I was also using a plethora
[SPEAKER_01]: of other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't say that I like noticed
something like, um, specifically from it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I kinda like, I still have a lot of
that kind of stuff, you know, like that I
[SPEAKER_01]: just didn't use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm still kind of like interested in
revisiting it and like kind of isolating
[SPEAKER_01]: it a bit more and seeing like what it
does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's kind of something that I
do, uh, just like messing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Local mentioned that like one of the
things he watches out for is like Antox.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if any of you in your
current or previous setups had like,
[SPEAKER_03]: how would I put it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of like a, almost like a sense of
like what would be risks during flower or
[SPEAKER_03]: things that were.
[SPEAKER_03]: How'd I put it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Were there things you were watching out
for that you were worried about?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I'll comment with the, uh,
Jack's three, two, one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's designed in like three to be
applied in like, you know, like not
[SPEAKER_04]: applied in three parts, but like it has a
three separate parts that you mix
[SPEAKER_04]: together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and it has, um, calcium nitrate,
which is like 15, zero zero.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they have like their base B or
whatever, which is like the, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: potassium and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they have like a magnesium
sulfate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but like, I mean, off the bat,
like you kind of know that some things
[SPEAKER_04]: aren't going to respond well because like
you have such a high nitrogen content.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and it sucks cause like in that
specific formula, your nitrogen is tied
[SPEAKER_04]: with your calcium.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not like you can cut back
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And expect to keep the same like calcium
content, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but really that's kind of like the
only formula that I've, I've seen that
[SPEAKER_04]: issue specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always try and look at like the
potassium rates towards the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and just like the potassium rates in
general, for some lines are like
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you'll start seeing that,
um, yellow tipping on the leaf tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that die back, I almost always see
that with like an overuse of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium heavy bloom product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can actually get bad enough on some
of these like three OEC recipes that,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, the brach tips themselves on the
flower start to get that same die back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I see it more and more on
commercial flower these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it just shows me that people are
reading bottles and not like actually
[SPEAKER_00]: being good growers, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe now it's making me curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like have any of you experienced like
major fuckups in this period before,
[SPEAKER_03]: or has it largely been smooth sailing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I fucked up a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Jack's gave me my, I like,
I'm not shitting on the product
[SPEAKER_04]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was totally like on my end.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but like, dude, it gave me the most
like inconsistent health, um, relatively
[SPEAKER_04]: speaking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, just cause some things were
so sensitive to the nitrogen that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: like, once the damage is done,
like it's not like you can fix it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's still going to have an
overabundance of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is that something you go in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I was just going to say like,
the thing I think to keep in mind too is
[SPEAKER_01]: like when you're running a bunch of new
plants, like you don't know what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do the first time, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's just like this element where
like sometimes I was growing some
[SPEAKER_01]: pineapple or not pineapple, some,
um, pine tar Kush from Caleb from,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, CSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I just noticed that like they
were drinking really slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I started getting into this weird
thing where I had nitrogen call,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and it, it, it's kind of like,
there's a certain point where you just got
[SPEAKER_01]: to leave it alone because it seems like
the more you do, the worse it's getting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, sometimes you just got to be
okay with like not knocking it out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: park and just, you know, maybe if you get
an idea of it, you get an idea of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, try it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like a slight deficiency is way easier
to deal with than like an overuse of
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can always add a little more to
make it taste better, but it's next to
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: To remove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause then like I did this one time I was
using, uh, um, you guys know, mad farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they did make like the Moab powder
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they had a trial like veg and bloom
powder line too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was growing using like their,
you know, exact, um, dilution rates and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, every time I mixed it,
it was like three Oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I kept watering it in and I just saw
the plants get worse and worse until I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, okay, this is too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like being newer to growing,
I was like, Oh, well, I saw this product
[SPEAKER_00]: at the grow shop and it's like a salt
remover, you know, and it's supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: help like rinse all these excess salts
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, at this point, like,
yeah, like you're saying, like you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're kind of just like too far gone,
you know, um, it's not going to get better
[SPEAKER_00]: and adding more stuff to try and remove
certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like the exact opposite of what,
um, you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like the old adage that everyone
used to say is like, um, use half as much
[SPEAKER_00]: as they say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like a growth chart for our,
like, uh, different fertilizer usage,
[SPEAKER_00]: like if I've got nitrogen on the Y axis
and then like plant growth on the X,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to see this matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite of that, um, plant growth on
the Y, you're going to see this massive
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in growth for, um, a certain
point, you know, it's just this nice
[SPEAKER_00]: exponential growth curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at a certain point, it plateaus
for quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it starts dropping, um,
and getting into, you know, like affect
[SPEAKER_00]: negatively affecting the yield for how
much you're using and nutrient companies
[SPEAKER_00]: want to push you as far over to the right
on that plateau as they can, where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using abundantly more for the same exact
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like what people always used to
recommend is just like start off with half
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of go from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was kind of going to add kind of
like the one thing I've noticed is there's
[SPEAKER_04]: no like benefit to feeding like over like
two and a half max.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, unless like you're, your system
is like truly fucking dialed in
[SPEAKER_04]: environmentally and you have like fucking
CO2 and an entirely sealed system and all
[SPEAKER_04]: that bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it, it's kind of irrelevant,
you know, under some circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like some of those stress
responses from being far over on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: like plateau where you're just adding more
and not getting a response is where you
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of end up in like hermaphroditic
territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like just weird expressions in
general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I mean, it is fair to say too,
that like, you know, it is stress on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it is creating salt stress on the
river zone and stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you also have to consider too,
like, you know, these dudes are like,
[SPEAKER_04]: sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're focusing on the fucking like,
uh, EC going in, but like also the
[SPEAKER_04]: immediate, like the EC in the medium is
like almost three times as much,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like I'm just like, this cannot
be fucking healthy for the plant at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the plant will like look,
you know, big and nice and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_04]: like at a commercial scale, but like,
there's just like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it lacks character at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's just like, um, you've,
you've heard like, I mean, I know I've
[SPEAKER_01]: heard like Matt and these guys talk about
like quote unquote computer-grown weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, like when you have these like
sensors and you're reading like
[SPEAKER_01]: drive-backs and like monitoring the,
I, you know, it's like, there are these
[SPEAKER_01]: setups where that's happening and they're
not necessarily producing like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, they're not always producing like the
best weed or whatever, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's something else to it,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, to me, that's just about
actually, uh, kind of a point that was
[SPEAKER_03]: made earlier, like actually watching the
plant and observing the plant and not,
[SPEAKER_03]: not immediately assuming that like
formalizing and automating and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, determining the process is
immediately a good thing, but it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: such a common impulse, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, one thing I did want to point out is
that I like what Farmer Dan had to say
[SPEAKER_03]: about, you know, erring on the side of
like a lighter feed than a heavier one,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I think when you're analyzing
risk, one of the good parameters to look
[SPEAKER_03]: at is reversibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, it reminds me of like watering
as well, you know, for newbies,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like erring on the side of watering
less because it's easier to bounce back
[SPEAKER_03]: from that than watering too much,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like, I kind of like some of those
strategic principles because it's helpful
[SPEAKER_03]: for newer people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you learn their importance real
quick after screwing up, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 weeks of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, then you're like, Oh,
I'll never going to forget that I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to water, you know, half as much or,
you know, whatever it is, water more or
[SPEAKER_00]: like less more frequently, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I wanted to add, no,
you go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say, I know like
there's so many products on the market to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, is for as far as nutrients and
stuff like that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, I'm the kind of person
that's like, you know, like, I want to try
[SPEAKER_01]: the newest stuff and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've always been, you know,
like I have, I want to get a nice computer
[SPEAKER_01]: or I want to get, you know, that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's very easy to kind of go down
that road, but like it's, it was really
[SPEAKER_01]: eye-opening to me when I went from using
all of these different inputs to using
[SPEAKER_01]: like literally just straight up three-part
general hydro and some, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: promix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these plants are coming out
looking really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, what is happening right
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just is so, it feels almost
counterintuitive, but I just wanted to say
[SPEAKER_01]: that because I do know that like as a new
grower, it's so easy to just want to just
[SPEAKER_01]: add more and more and more, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think you're just like one additive
away from hitting that three pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: light or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, you get obsessed on these
things where people are like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to use this, you know,
basalt lava ash or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, I'm sure there are some
really cool benefits from it, but like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, are you, are you like dial in
enough that you're going to notice it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like one thing I've kind of noticed is
there's like this rule of thumb to pick
[SPEAKER_04]: like a nice kind of two, two to three part
nutrient line and get to know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is like, you know, trying so many
different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's nice, but like you don't really
know how the product works until you like
[SPEAKER_04]: actually see it across the board and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've I've done maybe this is my third or
fourth grow with Kana.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my third.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know, like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that that two part kind of rules is
it's a nice one to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like for newer people,
I always recommend like, like bigger and
[SPEAKER_00]: was saying like the three part or two,
even a two part GH, because they have like
[SPEAKER_00]: the flora Nova, which is kind of like the
Synganic approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have, you know, like some soy
protein, hydrolysate and probably like a
[SPEAKER_00]: little seaweed extract in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can grow really great weed with
flora Nova grow bloom and like the GH
[SPEAKER_00]: roots like you can make perfectly good
weed with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a great place to start as far
as just like it's super easy to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can start slowly adding one thing
at a time to that and see if it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: does make a difference once you have that
baseline.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's kind of funny because I feel
like that that Lucas formula was like the
[SPEAKER_04]: best expression I was able to pull out of
like the sweet pea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I haven't really seen it like that
under Kana, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of just notice that like some
plants have their preferences in a way,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's not today's topic,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to spice things up a bit and do a
little tangent on myth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we start with everyone's
favorite flushing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wants to pick up the knife first?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, I guess the way I see flushing
is to like encourage likes in essence,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like I don't think it makes like
the smoke any better, but I just kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: want to make sure that the plants using
what it already has.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know, in soil or something
like soil, for example, that has like a
[SPEAKER_04]: higher cat on an exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always thought you'd want to flush it
a little longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, okay, wait, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before you go further, like, do you want
to define what you you call flushing
[SPEAKER_03]: first, or like what you're describing?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm kind of just like using it to
encourage the essence, like to kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the actual process when you say
flushing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you mean like you're holding off
feeding?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm just like, I'm just like watering
it like with water.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing too special.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like cocoa, I'll do like, you know,
two, three days.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's because like, it doesn't hold on
to nutrients as much as something like
[SPEAKER_04]: soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's easier to kind of strip those
sites off and kind of encourage the
[SPEAKER_04]: essence a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I got kind of obsessed with
flushing at one point, I think I've talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about this before, and they're like,
kind of what led me to doing some like DWC
[SPEAKER_01]: type stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've done flushing in the way that
locals saying is the way that I would
[SPEAKER_01]: generally do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have also taken like a five gallon
pot and poured like 20 gallons of water in
[SPEAKER_01]: one shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I have done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've measured like the PPM and stuff
of the runoff, you know, like all that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that you that you do that people do,
or maybe they don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it the cleanest smoke you ever had?
[SPEAKER_04]: Very white ash, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very white ash.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was almost clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing that's weird about it is
like, you know, I've had plants where,
[SPEAKER_01]: like where how local approaches it just
started like, I'll generally just stop
[SPEAKER_01]: watering for like the last like few days,
or not stop watering, but stop feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's interesting because some plants
will like change drastically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some plants will like,
I have this mule skinner from High Monson
[SPEAKER_01]: that I ended up flushing with just plain
water for like two weeks, because I was
[SPEAKER_01]: just like, well, I just want to see what
it's going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just like never changed, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just haven't noticed like a huge
difference in the quality of the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not something that I'm really
obsessed about, but I still do flush
[SPEAKER_01]: because like, I've also fed nutrients up
until the very end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also didn't like, it didn't make it
any better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figure if I can save on nutrients and
get the same end product, then I'll just
[SPEAKER_01]: do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to ask though, like,
are we talking about like, are we talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about like two different things?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is there flushing in the sense of
like, you're running water through your
[SPEAKER_03]: root zone to achieve some outcome versus
you're holding off feeding?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys, how do you guys see this
distinction or this like ambiguity?
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of view it as like, literally,
yeah, I think it is like people in their
[SPEAKER_00]: mind mixing up like a few different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I agree with Earn that it's like,
the reason that I don't feed for that last
[SPEAKER_00]: week or two is because I'm cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, if the plants like not,
if it doesn't make it better than like,
[SPEAKER_00]: why am I going to pay for fertilizer to go
into the pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want my soil to be a little bit
more leached and not heavy in nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially bloom new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like right once I throw because I
reuse my soil, I don't throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't want it to be like super
salt filled when I come back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, when I think about
flushing, it's like, some people think
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's like increasing, like it's like
causing some physiological change in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that makes it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people think that like fertilizer
crystals within the plant make the smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: harsher.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I kind of view it is like I'm
cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like the cure is honestly much
more important than the flush,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as all the like evaluation goes on
it, you know, and so like I've had stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that was fed, like from a seed production
run that was fed full strength,
[SPEAKER_00]: veg news all the way through flower till
the last day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a little bit harsher,
but it's not that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was perfectly smokable weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually had kind of like some nice
aroma changes with that too, with like
[SPEAKER_00]: high nitrogen feed all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like all these things that are like
kind of general rules of thumb in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and like within the community are
like not hard, fast rules for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like there is going to be some
plants that are like perfectly fine with
[SPEAKER_00]: high nitro or like salt all the way
through the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's going to be some that don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's kind of just about like
dialing it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think flushing makes your ash
whiter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just like stupid to even like
consider it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'll mention too, like back in the
day, like when I was like an amateur at
[SPEAKER_04]: growing, I would like flush my medium to
like clear out any fucking excess
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrients that I may have applied.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that was a form of flushing that I've
done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like it's not like I flush my medium
entirely and then go back to feeding,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, regularly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like I kind of do it in a way
where I don't let my medium dry out
[SPEAKER_04]: entirely too much where like salt spilled
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like in theory, I don't have to like
flush to like get rid of salt.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like achieve some runoff and
you'll kind of maintain an equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a bit of a tangent, but it's come
up as a term.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when I've listened to you,
local and Dan talk, what is the,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's kind of related to what you just
said, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what is the risk around like,
quote unquote, dry back or like benefits
[SPEAKER_03]: or like, how do you see dry back?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: In flower, like I've kind of always been
in practice to encourage a little more dry
[SPEAKER_04]: back than you would in veg kind of just to
like encourage that like winter's coming
[SPEAKER_04]: or whatever, or like water's a little more
restricted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like with that, like you kind of risk
salt build up because like, as you like
[SPEAKER_04]: dry back your concentration or like your,
the amount of water to like salt is going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be thrown off and like, you're going to
have a concentration of salt in your
[SPEAKER_04]: medium.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really like the only way to like get
that lower is by running water through it,
[SPEAKER_04]: strip, to strip the salts from the medium.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never like been bad enough to where
it like physically damages the plants to
[SPEAKER_04]: what I can see.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this kind of just goes back to
like what Dan was saying, as far as kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of staying on like the lighter side of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I can just tell you from personal
experience, like when you're there
[SPEAKER_01]: covering like 20 gallons of water through
a pot, it doesn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, you're like, you're like,
man, this cannot, this cannot be good for
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also in doing like taking like,
I would do it, I'd like do like a gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: and then do like a slurry test and see
where I was and go again, you know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't change it very much,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot of time to actually flush
it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just think like, yeah, just maybe
like try to not get into a position where
[SPEAKER_01]: you feel like you need to flush anyways.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice that you bring up the slurry
test to earn because like, I find that a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of people or a lot of newer growers
are like stuck on measuring the EC and pH
[SPEAKER_04]: of the runoff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like that runoff pH in theory,
like it's not going to be the same as the
[SPEAKER_04]: water going in or whatever, or the,
the pH of the actual medium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like you're, the plant's going to be
feeding as that water is like coming out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like some ions are going to be like
missing, making it either like more basic
[SPEAKER_04]: or acidic, at least to my understanding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if, if anyone else is able to
contribute to that, but yeah, they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not very accurate tests when
you're testing runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it is not like an exact
representation of what's going on in your
[SPEAKER_00]: pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the easiest example,
like in hydro, like the more inert your
[SPEAKER_00]: media goes, I feel like it is more
applicable, but especially in like a nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: well-blended potting soil, like I was
talking about earlier, with like compost
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, a lot more organic portions
to it that are, that are like did do come
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-fertilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can pour a cup of water through
some fresh bags of soil like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll come out at like four OEC,
but like not all of that is like readily
[SPEAKER_00]: plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's not an incredibly accurate test
on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you can finish dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, yeah, just saying like your
media really dictates like how accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think cocoa and pro mix kind of
style it, um, it's probably a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more accurate than like real soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but in hydro is kind of the only time
that I really even use it as a tool
[SPEAKER_00]: besides kind of just like, oh,
this is the general ball ballpark that the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH is in like plus or minus like,
you know, a few points and same with the
[SPEAKER_00]: EC like press plus or minus a few hundred
PPM.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to add an anecdote here,
which is that one of my most traumatic
[SPEAKER_03]: experiences as a new grower was like going
down this bizarre rabbit hole,
[SPEAKER_03]: probably wholly unnecessarily,
um, of like freaking out of freaking out
[SPEAKER_03]: about my, um, mediums pH, um, and just
getting completely lost because I didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: know what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and actually I think I told her about
this and I actually ended up just speaking
[SPEAKER_03]: to like a person on the phone,
which is quite bizarre.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've never spoken to like anyone in
this industry on the phone, like as a,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like a customer before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and he actually had really good
advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was just like, look, if you're a medium
act, there's something actually wrong with
[SPEAKER_03]: this pH or buffering capabilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are not going to be able to fix it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like at home, like you won't even have the
tools to like diagnose it properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I thought that was actually quite
good advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what something like when I
was still doing the quote unquote,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, living soil or organic
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I was using, uh, my soil like
multiple runs, you know, and, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have like an agricultural university
near us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took it and was getting some like
soil tested and stuff like that just to
[SPEAKER_01]: see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, through that whole process,
I just, I just like really realized that
[SPEAKER_01]: like a lot of the things that you're like
really stressing about, you really just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so hard to control them that,
uh, you're better off to just like get
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to put you on the right path
from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I had a, in my foray in like
organics, um, I feel like organics is
[SPEAKER_00]: where you actually do have to slightly pay
more attention to this because some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: organic inputs do have their own wild pH
swings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and the main one I'm thinking of is,
uh, a little bit farther back,
[SPEAKER_00]: like in the 20 teens up until
legalization, people were all about
[SPEAKER_00]: seabird guano and bat guano and the
seabird guano specifically, like they're
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting it off of these like little
ocean rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little rocky outcroppings that are
just covered in crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, what's also in it is tons of,
um, like shell from eggs, like all kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of different little products, byproducts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I noticed with that stuff is
that it's super, super basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was top dressing with like the
teaspoon, um, for like a three gallon pot
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, after a few weeks,
my runoff was like a pH of 10 and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like way out of whack because that seabird
guano was just like very, very,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, basic in its own natural component,
you know, based on its, uh, composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, with normal, like liquid
bottled nutrients, like you're usually
[SPEAKER_00]: watering in between like five,
eight and six, five by like design,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's like usually naturally
buffered by the way they've designed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're not inputting anything
that has a crazy pH swing, then like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you shouldn't have an issue going forward
at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's more, that's what he said.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was just like, if you have the right
product, it's going to be adequately
[SPEAKER_03]: buffered.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, you shouldn't really have to
worry about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like on this scale, you know, on this
level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't know if you'll have anything
else to say around this flushing topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to move it along towards like any
other weird myths that y'all have heard
[SPEAKER_03]: about flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I know that some people are like,
I'll just say that like one, one pet one
[SPEAKER_03]: for me is people who think that like
basically like abusing the shit out of
[SPEAKER_03]: your plant, like driving a steak through
like the stem or like super crossing or
[SPEAKER_03]: any of those things are beneficial.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I'm not going to say that they're
not like, I just don't know, but I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: curious about your, you know, everyone's
thoughts on stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think like the most that I've really
kind of like mess around with is like cold
[SPEAKER_01]: stress, you know, um, like early on just
kind of like, I, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I, it'll get really cold outside and
I'll like, sometimes like just vent cold
[SPEAKER_01]: air into my tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I still do that sometimes,
you know, um, and I think that it kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: tends to, I don't know, it may be like a
bro science thing, but it kind of tends to
[SPEAKER_01]: make them look a little bit like frostier
and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just feel like around like when
you can get like cold suit, like really
[SPEAKER_01]: cold dry air, the plants just like kind of
react to it a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've, you know, in the cold stress
thing too, I've also seen like people
[SPEAKER_01]: taking like ice and putting it in there,
you know, putting it on top of their soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and like watering over it and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to force that purple man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was, when I was like starting out,
um, I just didn't really understand a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, you know, purple weed was pretty
and that's cool or whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: now it's just not something that I'm,
I'm really concerned with.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite one is when, uh, if you ever
go to a hydro shop, they, they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: common anymore, but especially the shops
that have been around a lot, they just
[SPEAKER_00]: have this shit leftover from years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, there's all these white bottles
with like different pictures of fruit on
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all like artificially
flavored, um, like sugar supplements,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, they were everywhere for a long
time and like, they'll just have a picture
[SPEAKER_00]: of a grape on it and it smells like
artificial grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's obviously how you make grape
aromas and weed is by like pouring
[SPEAKER_00]: artificial grape flavoring and sugar in
your, in your media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are from like professional
companies like botanic care and shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it was just like a thing for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that they knew it was
bullshit when they were mass producing
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but it's a, it's one of those like
old messages that I just always laugh
[SPEAKER_00]: about in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I had a person tell me, sorry,
just about the fruit thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, that you could like put your buds,
like when you were drying them,
[SPEAKER_01]: like have them on a rack and then have
like fruit underneath of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like a, a fan like blowing across onto
the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone told me that's how I should be
drying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ethylene, baby.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's pretty nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many fucking like old live tales that
there are.
[SPEAKER_04]: This community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like hang your plants upside down while
you're drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it, it concentrates the THC in the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an amazing one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be in the hall of fame of
myths.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the one that Matt said one time,
like shock the plants with like a car
[SPEAKER_00]: battery.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think for me it's more of a,
like a psychological or I don't know,
[SPEAKER_03]: cultural interest that I have in this kind
of general strategy of like, if you were
[SPEAKER_03]: violent towards your plant and if you
traumatize it, it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, why though?
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes me think I was, I was reading
some kid's a master's thesis out of San
[SPEAKER_00]: Luis Obispo and in it's about like
reversal tech and like trialing out a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in it, he like has this full paragraph
about like Soma's ruralization technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's like this, like, you know,
industry accepted methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just love that that appeared in a
master's thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember like screen capping that
and sending it to Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, look at this bullshit,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to, you have to elaborate what
that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ruralization is just like torturing
your plant through like drought stress and
[SPEAKER_00]: heat and like keeping a giant plant in a
solo cup and like just stressing it in
[SPEAKER_00]: every way imaginable to like get it to
herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it like, I guess it works on some
things, but it's just like, if you think
[SPEAKER_00]: about like the potential epigenetic costs
of that, like, I don't know, it's not like
[SPEAKER_00]: a proven thing, but I just can't imagine
that like stressed plants produce the best
[SPEAKER_00]: possible offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope these people aren't parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make some strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, go, you know, go play on the
train tracks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll help build character kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's last generation's games.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other like weird myths that y'all can
think of apart from like, so we mentioned
[SPEAKER_03]: additives, various kinds of like stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people do like a, I've heard people
talk about like doing like a dark period
[SPEAKER_01]: before flowering to like help flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 24 hours dark on flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that one from when I first
started growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember, dude, I mean, you can get on
Reddit and there are just threads
[SPEAKER_01]: dedicated to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I just destroy them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's, you know, I mean, yeah,
all sorts of things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also the 28 or fly for people doing 48
hours of two days, no lights before
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually noticed that that technique
can help to some degree with, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: different reversal sprays too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amount of phytotoxicity you
experience and then also just like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy is that, um, I think that there's
some interplay with, um, light intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: and like the plant breaking down the
silver ions that you're spraying on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I don't have like proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all kind of anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it could also just be like hormone
play and like the newest portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is, um, like has a different set of
hormones, doesn't have that concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: of silver on it from the last phrase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it reverts back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to female first, but it's just
something I've noticed is that the lowers
[SPEAKER_00]: on plants tend to stay, um, a little more
reversed than the tops do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have a little experiment in mind
of like under lighting and not top
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting and, and seeing if that has like
any effect on that, but just a little side
[SPEAKER_00]: tangent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that makes sense too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, cause you know, I mean,
a lot of those things, um, break,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, have some kind of like decay in
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it very well could be that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe we can step away from the old
wives tales and myths and kind of come
[SPEAKER_03]: back to, you know, the earnest side of
flowering and anything else that we may
[SPEAKER_03]: have missed out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what about if we think towards like
late flower, does anything change or is it
[SPEAKER_03]: like even more hands off than the rest of
it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause for me, generally it is right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure for most people it's like,
you're just watching waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm still just kind of,
um, I'm paying attention probably like the
[SPEAKER_01]: most I am to the humidity, uh,
around that time, you know, around the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of flower and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also, I will also tend to like
lower my lights just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like at the start of flower,
I'll, I'll be somewhere around like 80 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 85% and I'll get up to about like 90,
95% and then I'll work my way back down to
[SPEAKER_01]: around like 80% for the last like week,
you know, just kind of give them a break,
[SPEAKER_01]: let them chill out, do their thing,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing with us or local,
but I do the same thing and I just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: scale back the nutrients slowly from like
week six to nine and I'm taught like 300
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per million increments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do the same thing with the lighting
where I kind of slowly ramp it back down
[SPEAKER_00]: from that peak.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to add those last two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'll like, I won't feed every
watering, but I'll like supplement just
[SPEAKER_04]: like a little bit of plain water kind of
just to, you know, cause they're,
[SPEAKER_04]: they don't really need to eat that much,
but it's kind of just to feed them a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit, kind of get rid of some of
that food, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah, nothing too crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then I guess I did want to comment
earlier on like the old wives tale.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, is there like, there's no like,
kind of a one kind of cure all product
[SPEAKER_04]: like Cal Mag, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of people like recommend that
for everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just like, I don't know,
just take information with the grain of
[SPEAKER_04]: salt, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cal Mag for president, baby.
2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'd made that meme years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: How often have you all encountered like
botrytis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, a lot in flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've, I've had it, you know,
a few times in my, in my time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember the very first time it was
like, I was so devastated that first time
[SPEAKER_03]: it was like, you know, Christmas was
ruined.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then over time I'm like, I've become a
little bit more like desensitized to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, Hey, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've lost like a couple of tops,
like whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, for my personal growing,
I've never had like too much an issue with
[SPEAKER_00]: it with like some of my like very first
blue dream crops, like the more I would
[SPEAKER_00]: knock it out of the park, the worse the
botrytis would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like, we just didn't have the
humidity control for end of flower out on
[SPEAKER_00]: the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always at like, you know,
80%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I've lost when I was up in Oregon,
I lost like a field to botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's devastating.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of funny that you bring up the
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I actually had one Santa Cruz rack.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the number three that I had never
finished flowering it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it showed signs of a botrytis early.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was, it was a crowded tent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, you know what, like it's just
best to kind of cut this thing down and
[SPEAKER_04]: not let it get to the rest.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, that's kind of,
I mean, if it's one plant, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: in an entire tent and you don't want to
sacrifice it like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if like you're, you're
outdoors, like that's when it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're at the mercy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like that year I lost that field
that started raining September 1st and it
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't stop for about six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the end of October was like
gorgeous, you know, just to like rub it in
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, you can, once it starts,
it's not going to get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a single product that you can
spray to stop a tritus once it's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the tritus itself is actually
like a hodgepodge of a few different
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, and they're all like not
treatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's usually time to cut it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing I've noticed too,
with the tritus is a lot of times,
[SPEAKER_04]: like the bud can look fine on the outside,
but like the inside is where it's fucked
[SPEAKER_04]: up, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why, like, um, your IPM going
into flower, like we were talking earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: is super important because even if you do
have something that you don't mind
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying partway through flower,
that's like a little more inert,
[SPEAKER_00]: like an enzyme spray or something,
it's not going to get into those internal
[SPEAKER_00]: crevices of a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where those mold spores,
because like the tritus is like a
[SPEAKER_00]: metropolitan fungi is what they call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in the airstream, like all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, it's all about just like not
creating conditions for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your IPM early on is going to
dictate whether it's going to be a big
[SPEAKER_00]: problem for you later, because,
um, a few early sulfur sprays to kill
[SPEAKER_00]: those, um, mold spores off and kind of
inhibit them early on can go pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say to Loco, like,
you know, you build up, you build up that
[SPEAKER_03]: like fear of seeing those like twisted
little leaves and stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just never really, I I've had it a lot,
like the outdoor plants here, but I've not
[SPEAKER_01]: had it inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I stay pretty on top of it or I try to
like between runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I take everything out and,
you know, clean it with like hot bleach
[SPEAKER_01]: water and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I really do just,
I just try to like focus on keeping my
[SPEAKER_01]: grow environment just like fairly clean,
generally speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seems like it helps for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some Xeritol sprays or like
peroxyacetic acid with bleach,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, or even just bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bleach is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I got to the point, um, when I was at
like a slightly smaller commercial scale
[SPEAKER_00]: where I would literally atomize the entire
room with Xeritol and bleach water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I'm hitting the lights,
I'm hitting the tables, I'm hitting the
[SPEAKER_00]: walls and ceiling, like a good reset and
keeping clean all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really big for the fungi problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, when you guys are talking about
IPM, like I, it's, I, it's not the best
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to say, but I don't do a ton of IPM
because I just really stay on top of that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I just haven't seen this issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if I do see something,
obviously I'll address it, but like since
[SPEAKER_01]: my very first, like the very first time I
had, I got spider mites, uh, from a
[SPEAKER_01]: friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then otherwise that was such a
terrible experience that I was just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to stay on top of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was just like really upset to
like lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really lose, but I just felt like
I could have done so much better and all
[SPEAKER_01]: these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I just need to stay on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like keep your system closed loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more you intake, um, the more you
intake stuff from outside, like that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just the higher chances you're going to
get bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, if you don't clone trade and
you just pop seeds and stuff, the chances
[SPEAKER_00]: of you having anything, but like a little
bit of a tritus on your biggest buds is
[SPEAKER_00]: like pretty low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, you can keep on top of it a
lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I advise against clone trading for
the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also too, like if you have some,
even if you just have like one or two
[SPEAKER_01]: plants outside, like when you come inside,
wash your hands, you know, stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just, just like things that are
pretty common sense, but, um, they can
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely go a long way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess to like a lot of the new
growers, like it's never too late to start
[SPEAKER_04]: like an IPM, like you're better off
starting off earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before there's a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so just, just a little note,
uh, Dan, do you have to go Dan?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta go take my boy out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's his first like real Halloween that he
can kind of understand what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to mess with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we bid you adieu for now?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, uh, the three of us can wrap up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like thank you guys for having me on again
and, uh, had a great chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was love bullshitting with the boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, thanks for saving the last
three recordings, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No worries, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife is a little, uh, she's like,
are you done yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, uh, we got one more coming
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, but I will, I will see you all
again for this, uh, this Z Shurb episode
[SPEAKER_00]: that we keep alluding to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try to give you a week off next week
and then we'll come back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see you later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess for us it's just like
rounding this out now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is there, is there like anything
else that you all want to say about
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering or like, um, maybe, uh,
is it worth talking about your last,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether you last flowered anything
interesting to highlight?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I guess, uh, the one thing to
highlight is like a lot of these,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, uh, bottled formulas or powdered
formulas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, a lot of those are like not designed,
but like they're advertised for like nine,
[SPEAKER_04]: nine week crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like when you're, um, growing like
longer flowering plants, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of just want to prolong those
periods by like an extra week or two,
[SPEAKER_04]: if that makes sense, like just to
compensate for any of the extra weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's kind of what I've,
I've done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and it's helped me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah, I don't know if that's just
kind of one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's, that's probably where it's
good to have some basic understanding of
[SPEAKER_03]: like the distinct stages.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at least you can translate like the
timeframes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I've said, like my issues mainly
been like a potassium deficiency,
[SPEAKER_04]: like towards like the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, now I know next time it's just
to kind of supplement a little extra
[SPEAKER_04]: potassium, just to kind of keep the plant
covered up until then.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's really it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I, by no means am I an expert on like
feeding plants at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like none of my plants like 100% happy by
any means, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's definitely,
I think that's the biggest thing that I
[SPEAKER_01]: would try to impress on people is that
it's there's, you know, like you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get to a place where
you're growing stuff that you're happy
[SPEAKER_01]: with, but you're probably always going to
feel like you can make your plants look
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, and so they're just,
you just have to find that place.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a comfortable medium for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, you know, I, I said this the last
time, but I didn't qualify it for this
[SPEAKER_03]: recording, but like one of the reasons why
I've chosen the three of you is because
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a really nice spread of like
experience, you know, we've earned who's a
[SPEAKER_03]: bit newer growing for a couple of years,
local, maybe like what a decade local or
[SPEAKER_03]: more slightly more.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not, not yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven years at max.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say seven years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Dan, you know, with like,
I think about 15, that that would have had
[SPEAKER_04]: me growing at the age of 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Dan started when he was 17.
[SPEAKER_04]: When did you It started when I was 18.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's early, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's still really early.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think my point was also that,
one, we have a spread of experiences just
[SPEAKER_03]: to showcase that because I think that's
good information in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also like Ern said, no matter where
you are, there's always something that you
[SPEAKER_03]: could improve still.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anyone at any point is like,
yeah, it's perfect all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I just also want to say each
plant's a new adventure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like every seed you pop, you're never
going to know until you flower it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some things like to take care of
themselves, and that's always a fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: bonus.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then there are those instances where
there's just some parents just aren't the
[SPEAKER_04]: happiest parents.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of the offspring might express
some of those sensitive traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may as well kind of treat it like
every time you grow something new,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like a new game almost.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have some of the, of course,
your baseline protocols.
[SPEAKER_03]: But apart from that, it's like you're just
going to have to react slash rerun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was pretty cool, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say popping the Eevee Appie and all
the Santa Cruz rec, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each individual has its different needs,
and that's just an entire different game
[SPEAKER_04]: on its own.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're from the same parents.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have some that take care of
themselves, some that need a little more
[SPEAKER_04]: babying, and others, this and that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I know I wanted to say
something, but sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, you're good, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think I kind of covered it mostly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think something that I would say is
maybe I wonder a lot of people talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: that they sometimes have plants that just
don't look good for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's OK if you run something and you
just don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we really talk about keeping stuff
around a lot and learning stuff and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there can come a time where sometimes
you just don't have to force it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just have a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just remember why you started growing,
that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very much about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want there to be good vibes and that
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a nice sentiment for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, anything else, guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, we can probably start wrapping up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can start on the outro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're probably going to plug the
Discord, but if anybody has questions or
[SPEAKER_04]: any of that shit, we're always on the
Discord.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just dudes like everyone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like talking about that too,
so please come.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you two are already there,
but any shout outs from either of you for
[SPEAKER_03]: anything?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, shout out to Matt for always
having us on, letting us shoot the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I just wanted to say too,
Denali sent me some really cool disc golf
[SPEAKER_01]: swag this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that this is very meaningful and I
just want to say shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's the fucking best, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Denali is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's trying to blackmail me, says he won't
come on the show unless I visit you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, shout out to you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Local, especially.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's going to have two or three
recordings in a row, so I appreciate that
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, shout out to Dan and Ern,
of course, for making the time as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, lastly, shout out to Matt just
for doing all of this and letting us also
[SPEAKER_03]: run the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's also for him a nice thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he has one to get to the point
where he could trust other people to
[SPEAKER_03]: handle the show if he's busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think he's also really stoked about
where this is all headed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm sure we will welcome him back very
soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Apart from that, I just want to say that
like Dan mentioned, we are lining up a
[SPEAKER_03]: skills episode, as we've said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just takes a little bit more prep because
we want Dan has a few questions that he
[SPEAKER_03]: wants to get sent to CSI.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Matt's going to facilitate some
questions to Caleb.
[SPEAKER_03]: That will be part of the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Local will join us as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll talk about some of the hunting
that he's doing through some sure best
[SPEAKER_03]: ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Apart from that, we've also probably got a
harvest and post-harvest episode coming
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Initially, I thought this was just for the
outdoor group.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that we've done this one here,
it may be that we just combine forces.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just do like harvest and post-harvest,
just like a combined group.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't think it, yeah,
obviously that goes across indoor and
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see how people are positioned for
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, riotseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Riot Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe, for those of you in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Gurt by Seeds run by our homie

which is how you can get onto our Discord.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always talk about the Discord.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always rap about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm almost at the point where I'm like,
maybe we should not push it so hard
[SPEAKER_03]: because it sounds culty.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is a great place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do recommend it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And lastly, we've got the Codex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do check that out if you haven't already.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put some more pressure on Matt to add more
entries or update them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also hope to get Bodhi on to help us
with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once he's settled in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you everyone again for showing
up on this Friday night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again, you guys, for setting aside
your Halloween night to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we will catch you all next week.
