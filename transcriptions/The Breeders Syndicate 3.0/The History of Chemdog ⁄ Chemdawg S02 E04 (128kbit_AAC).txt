[SPEAKER_01]: Get this angle going so you can see that
beautiful bitch right there Cuz I like
[SPEAKER_01]: showing her What's up everyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: About to get this shit jumping
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh Anyway any fucking way so tonight
we're gonna Do a little Kim 101 I used
[SPEAKER_01]: that term because that was the original
Thread on IC mag that covered chem dog
[SPEAKER_01]: started by our buddy high and lonesome So
this will be the Kenan 101 video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish high and lonesome would be here too
On camera with us, but yeah, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: this isn't a custom.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is that's actually what's called a
Epiphone It's an Epiphone not a Gibson.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a prism plus so it's all Epiphone
parts or I'm sorry all Gibson parts
[SPEAKER_01]: pickups everything in it Coil splitting
but a really thin thin thin neck,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I love so yeah So yeah, I'm gonna
bring not so in and it looks like there's
[SPEAKER_01]: already 90 people in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get this shit jumping What's up,
Keith?
[SPEAKER_01]: Props to Keith too cuz he's the one who
really kind of put this in my brain today
[SPEAKER_01]: to get this going Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's?
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go Yeah, this is a Brins paint
not mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know much about paint What's up,
dude wasabi, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ready to Drop the verbal pipe bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, hopefully will be
educational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll try to keep Try to keep you
know facts from Educated guesses separate
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a lot of times a lot of times those
two things got get conflated Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what people know versus what
people think, you know, yeah, so I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a good idea Let's see firstly,
of course, like you just said we'll say
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll start with the disclaimer A lot of
this is going to be theory and conjecture
[SPEAKER_01]: based on educated guesses based on
breeding based on talking to pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone involved in the in the chem
Lineage and sour lineage from from back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the day till now It's it's a lot of it was
put together by CSI Humboldt, you know a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of what what what I've I've discovered
and He's discovered and not so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: discovered all combined into one grand
ultimate theory However, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: speak for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can always speak on his own I offered
him to come on here, but he's always too
[SPEAKER_01]: busy So it's just gonna be me and not so
and we're gonna try to cover it as best we
[SPEAKER_01]: can as accurate as we can and with the
best intentions because earlier someone
[SPEAKER_01]: wrote me and it was this it was around it
was this morning and He was just asking,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like is it what is you know chem
D?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is what is chem A?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's all this stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought about I was like there
really is no one place people can go as a
[SPEAKER_01]: resource to really get a good idea for
What these lines are what's behind them
[SPEAKER_01]: and the history?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of piecing together from
different forms stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even then there's a lot of stuff
That's just not out there because people
[SPEAKER_01]: are scared to step on toes And I think
it's been long enough that no toes should
[SPEAKER_00]: be stepped on Yeah, I mean it's also true
in a lot of ways where You know the truth
[SPEAKER_00]: the truth survives a lot better When
there's where there's little fame or rep
[SPEAKER_00]: or money involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because there's no reason to alter
it And you know as soon as anything
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes, you know famous or you know,
there's money involved or whatever else
[SPEAKER_00]: then all of a sudden, you know Sometimes
there's battling amongst people as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: like who did what when and how and
everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah You know, it's uh, yeah and chem
is you know chem's this this this topic
[SPEAKER_00]: has been debated now for When did the
forum talk start Matt like oh six?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah somewhere around there is when people
started jumping on it Yeah, so probably
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's been it's been publicly debated
now in various ways and various,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know forms for 16 years or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Which is pretty incredible when it
comes to like a bunch, you know a small
[SPEAKER_00]: group of like hippie kids just partying
and then all of a sudden fame happens
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly, dude So let's start with
uh, let's start with the beginning The
[SPEAKER_01]: chem 91 the dog bud Bag seed as it were.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so maybe maybe maybe I'll start
at not the beginning but a beginning right
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we'll go back to the beginning so
My my start in the cannabis story as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as chem dog goes comes in the late 90s I
had I Just I recently found the Mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: perps And I'd grown a couple crops of it
and I had I had a friend who will remain
[SPEAKER_00]: nameless Simply because he doesn't really
like fame, but I've previously referred to
[SPEAKER_00]: him as Staten Island and You know as we
became friends He gave me the chem what
[SPEAKER_00]: later was called the dog at the time the
dog and the super stoke Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep And we became like really really good
friends for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he used to tell me about a bunch of
the stories about the chem and how all
[SPEAKER_00]: that came to be and this is you know,
this is late 90s early 2000s as all these
[SPEAKER_00]: stories are getting told so That's kind of
my aspect into the chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah at the time other than him And myself
he had given it a couple of years previous
[SPEAKER_00]: to giving it to me He had given it to the
guy who's known on here as skunk VA You'll
[SPEAKER_00]: forgive me if I if I pause for a second
because I'm trying to like instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: saying all these people's names I'm trying
to use their internet handle, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a little different because you
know, you don't ever call them by these
[SPEAKER_00]: things in person, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But you know, there was a few people
there was a couple literally probably like
[SPEAKER_00]: four or five people in the state of
California that had yeah, right and then
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you can fast forward to the
forums where skunk VA came out and sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: the chem dog 101 which Matt reference
began to come out and all kinds of people
[SPEAKER_00]: started debating various aspects and But
for a while say from the time that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: created until its fame as it were You
know, it was really only a small group of
[SPEAKER_00]: people they kind of had it so probably the
the easiest way to say it is in the summer
[SPEAKER_00]: of 1991 there was chem dog was seeing some
Grateful Dead shows and At Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_00]: shows I've said previously it was a really
great place to buy kind bud Especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have been one of the only
consistent places To buy kind bud at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: and so he was I think he was 17 years old
at the time and he bought some kind bud
[SPEAKER_00]: from a guy named Joe brand and His and his
kind of his sidekick pee bud right The
[SPEAKER_00]: story diverges right after that because he
either found Supposedly 13 seeds in that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind bud or he or he got Pee bud and Joe
to send him one more batch of something of
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and he found the seeds in bad,
but But needless to say the reason why
[SPEAKER_00]: people call it deer crew For younger
people is deer Creek is one of the venues
[SPEAKER_00]: in The I'm getting confused by questions
the chem that Jason the chem that Jason
[SPEAKER_00]: King wrote about was my chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my weed I grew it and I gave him
I even wrote him out a list of what to say
[SPEAKER_00]: and It did not make an accurate
transcription in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, he took some artistic license but
anyway, you know, so So chem dog takes it
[SPEAKER_00]: home, right and he has the seeds and he
sprouts four or five of them or one,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know No, he sprouts a he sprouts a few
because out of that comes the chem sis and
[SPEAKER_00]: the chem 91 Okay, and I will say about the
chem sis that my buddy from Staten Island
[SPEAKER_00]: remembers it but Chem sis is chem a chem a
through D Yeah, so, you know two of them
[SPEAKER_00]: survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes of the let's put it that way of the
first of the first batch of seeds popped
[SPEAKER_00]: To became named.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and the other ones probably ended up
getting lost Everyone that I first met
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone called it the dog Most of the
growers that had it my buddy from Staten
[SPEAKER_00]: Island skunk VA etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all organic growers So they
weren't super hyped back then on calling
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course And you know Americans we
like to shorten shit or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of us just called it the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was the dog, right and So,
you know it so chem dog had the dog and he
[SPEAKER_00]: was growing the dog for a number of years
and It became kind of popular in the East
[SPEAKER_00]: Coast in certain circles And he was really
militant about not giving it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he didn't want to get cut off
Right he had sort of a trap market this
[SPEAKER_00]: and that no granted You know as the case
may be you have to realize that like at
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's you know 17 18 19 years old at best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right We these are grateful dead
kids, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my buddy from Staten Island Has been
trying to get it from him and chem dog
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't give it to anybody on the East
Coast okay, and My buddy moved out to
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonoma County in Northern, California just
north of San Francisco and he wanted to be
[SPEAKER_00]: closer To the grateful dead Jerry Garcia
Jerry band the Bay Area hippies,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: so he left New York and Chem dog because
dude was on the West Coast and 3,000 miles
[SPEAKER_00]: away agreed to give it to him if As long
as he promised to never ever give it to
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone back on the East Coast Yeah,
he didn't want it to spread anywhere in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York or Massachusetts or yeah at the
same time He had this he had this weed
[SPEAKER_00]: That he smoked with these other hippies at
some Jerry Garcia shows And these guys
[SPEAKER_00]: flipped out over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They adored it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted it really bad and so they said
if you come to Virginia right,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will give you this skunk cut that we
have and You know in exchange for this
[SPEAKER_00]: this cut that you have so dude arranged it
to go to Virginia and trade this cut for
[SPEAKER_00]: the super skunk and then he drove to
Massachusetts and met chem dog and Chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog gave him the dog and because dude had
a couple extra cuts of this skunk He gave
[SPEAKER_00]: one to chem dog and then he took the super
skunk and the dog and drove west.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was about 1993.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so that's that's kind of that's kind
of where like the the West Coast kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: comes into it is He brought it out to the
West Coast And then that was 1993 and he
[SPEAKER_00]: was pretty much the only one growing it
for a few years Yeah, either one of them
[SPEAKER_00]: on the West Coast Actually, nobody else
had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was basically like one small garage
and you could get either one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: strains if you happen to go to like a
Jerry Garcia show at the Warfield or
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere in the Bay or anywhere in
California He would likely be there with
[SPEAKER_00]: ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah slinging ounces for 400 bucks an
ounce, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: so you fast forward a couple years and
it's 1995 and Jerry has a heart attack and
[SPEAKER_00]: dies and Skunk VA decides to come off dead
to her And wants to grow some wheat and so
[SPEAKER_00]: initially my buddy gives him the super
skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, which is dudes taking some Polaroids
and He's posted him up on his IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some I think some 95 96
Polaroids and let's go ahead and delineate
[SPEAKER_01]: here that between Start start calling it
the VA super skunk the one just try to
[SPEAKER_01]: refer to it as that because there might be
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other hard part too is that all
these other terms besides dog and super
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk Came about on the internet when
people were trying to figure out what the
[SPEAKER_00]: hell we had so Va VA skunk Massachusetts
super skunk chem 91 Skunk VA cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think any of those things really
even existed until the mid 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah in terms of In terms of nomenclature
in terms of names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like the SS and the dog Yeah,
yeah, it's super skunk and dog and the
[SPEAKER_00]: only reason why I'm really telling the
super skunk thing for a minute is just
[SPEAKER_00]: because it ties into how homie got it and
Brought it west.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what something what someone should know
is that and He wasn't part of the skunk VA
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't part of the dead No There was a
bunch of us a few hundred thousand people
[SPEAKER_00]: That either went, you know that traveled
around with the dead While there was dead
[SPEAKER_00]: shows up until 1995 and he was one of
those people Yeah, he was one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: people P bud was another one of those
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was Joe Brand There was a lot of people
that went to shows and hustled various
[SPEAKER_00]: things to To make it to the next show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know and so, you know and Don't
get caught up in questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get caught up in questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get caught up in questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, don't worry about yeah, so we'll
cover them so he So he got you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so basically what it boiled down to is
that there was one guy From 1993 on that
[SPEAKER_00]: had it on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes Right, and he promised he was he's
always been kind of stingy about cuts You
[SPEAKER_00]: know He kind of saw what was coming,
you know, it might have been a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: years off at that point But he saw that
there was a bunch of shenanigans that was
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna happen And so he was always pretty
militant about getting trading cuts and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that I didn't really trade cuts
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of by Sheer accident became
like a super close friend of his yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's pretty much why I got them
Yeah, you know, we just traded everything
[SPEAKER_00]: back and forth because we were so close,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so That's kind of the start now here's
an interesting thing my buddy from Staten
[SPEAKER_00]: Island smoked both the dog and the chem
sis back then But he didn't bring the chem
[SPEAKER_00]: sis West because he thought it was far
inferior Okay, he didn't want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know for sure that the chem sis was
one of the earliest cuts Oh he yes he to
[SPEAKER_00]: my knowledge the chem sis and the chem dog
or the dog Are the two cuts that came out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the first popping of seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and they existed and he remembers
smoking them in You know before he moved
[SPEAKER_00]: west in 91 92 You know he you know,
so he I have you know independent
[SPEAKER_00]: confirmation Yeah, right that those both
those things existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to know Stephen I I had no
clue if Ken because it's always been said
[SPEAKER_01]: that chem sis was a part of the chem a 3d
pop and that's where It's confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he he actually he and he thought it
was ugly and he didn't like the high Makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he didn't he didn't bring it West.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had the opportunity to bring it West He
didn't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, right You know and so that doesn't
mean it wasn't good or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just yeah It was one dude's opinion,
you know, but it was ugly Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and it wasn't as good and so,
you know So anyway, so, you know the the
[SPEAKER_00]: story Of chem is that you know what became
known as you know chem 91 insists came out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that first 91 seed pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah right and You know it it goes off it
goes off on tangents because it ties into
[SPEAKER_00]: sour and all these different things But we
can keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I don't know we can keep
it pretty close I'm doing my best to not
[SPEAKER_00]: look at questions, but it's fucking hard
so Anyway, those those were the those were
[SPEAKER_00]: the first two cuts I mostly have I'll say
this I know a lot about what happened on
[SPEAKER_00]: the West Coast Simply because I'm good
friends with him and I'm good and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: known the other people that had it for
forever now, you know, yeah and You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we also traded a ton of stories about
things Before the forums really existed
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and before it was ever created
before it was ever talked about or before
[SPEAKER_00]: we had any idea that like Anything of this
shit was going to be anything important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah either Right because that's what
happens with a lot of famous weed is that
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody has any idea what they're doing is
going to be Important or people are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to care Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like everyone's taking
meticulous notes in case They get famous
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, these are we are partying hippies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and take smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking LSD We're trying to chase
chicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're tripping around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing our thing circle jerking all
of it Yeah, that was more like I think
[SPEAKER_00]: you're You know so to speak but to each
their own to each their own so You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, that's that's kind of what and
you got to remember too for chem dog I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean chem dog was literally 17 years old
when he got these fucking seats Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if anyone I don't know how
old everyone who's listening is but like
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're 17 18 19 You don't have very
much together The fact that dude was able
[SPEAKER_00]: to throw together some lights,
especially in the early 90s when there was
[SPEAKER_00]: no forums There was no information.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was two or three books you could buy
Yeah, and some friends, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the tech was pretty basic Yeah,
it was not easy to get information back
[SPEAKER_00]: then It was not easy to learn like most of
the time you learned you did whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone who knew who was growing around
you was doing if you knew anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I didn't know anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I literally started from books So,
you know he Yeah, and it was totally
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no medical or anything like
that, obviously, but uh You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started with with some teenagers and
bag seed from a dead show So as a result
[SPEAKER_00]: of that You know The what it is exactly
will will kind of be an eternal mystery
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, huh kind of yeah You know and
I'm at least at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at least at this point that we're
speaking about It's complete mystery on
[SPEAKER_01]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you know, and I should also say
too that They Great chem dog wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: friends with P bud or Joe brand or
anything like that like he what they
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't in the circle or a Crew they were
just like someone that they bought weed
[SPEAKER_00]: off of it a dead show something here in
this Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those guys had those guys had no Idea
for years and years and years that
[SPEAKER_00]: anything came out of that weed sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like at all you know and so You know
people are saying being a skelly hit hash
[SPEAKER_00]: plant dog, but there's all kind there's
all kinds of rumors that have come out
[SPEAKER_00]: after the fact right, but the bottom line
is that Some older partiers who sold weed
[SPEAKER_00]: for a living?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, who are constantly buying and
selling different types of weed on dead
[SPEAKER_00]: tour Sold the sack of weed one day and
then 15 years later found out something
[SPEAKER_00]: came with it Yeah, so there was no like
calls back like hey that thing that we use
[SPEAKER_00]: really special what what like there wasn't
any kind of information exchange like that
[SPEAKER_01]: going and then and and to me this is where
kind of like well, I guess maybe Let's
[SPEAKER_01]: take it year by year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into the The chem a through D
then I mean or can be through D I guess if
[SPEAKER_01]: Kim sister because Kim sisters considered
Kim a if I remember correctly same thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean it you know, I so I mean you can say
there's there's rumors I I was not You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I was not obviously on the East
Coast and all this stuff happened but I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean I You know, I knew the various people
involved And that's what I was told.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what we know for sure is that two
keepers came out of the first batch of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds got you Yeah, that's what we know
for sure And then let's get to so we've
[SPEAKER_01]: gone on about the 91 we haven't really
said about what we think it is or anything
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do that at the end Let's do the the
D era Okay, so fast forward nine years
[SPEAKER_00]: nine years nine years Okay, right and
maybe God I should I Mean we have I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll just bounce around in time fast
forward nine years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and He's got some seeds and he
decides to pop some more seeds Okay Any
[SPEAKER_00]: labels on whatever, you know, maybe CDE,
you know, so on and so forth Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it seems like the one true keeper that
came out of that was the D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay, so So there was the D right
and and at this point the story has has
[SPEAKER_01]: been That he found males and that he
didn't find males based on what post you
[SPEAKER_00]: refer to in this Yeah, like a lot of
things I've said before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's there's issues with chem
dog in the sense that Not all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things he has written on the forums can
all be true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I'm not saying he's a liar
Your recollection and this year versus how
[SPEAKER_00]: you write It Matt year and all that type
of stuff, you know and what you were doing
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you remember, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because you know, I mean Matt,
you know Matt we've we've we've chatted
[SPEAKER_00]: with some very old-school cats and Some of
them have very poor memory on what they
[SPEAKER_00]: were up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's for sure That seems to be
consistent among.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah most older heads Yeah, none of them
knew it was gonna be famous or matter or
[SPEAKER_00]: need to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah or need to remember so basically at
this point we should say that I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly sure when the sis died.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's just say that there was the
the dog Aka chem 91 and then there was the
[SPEAKER_00]: sis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and then there was the deep Yeah,
so by 2000 there was there was three cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, and You know fast forward five or
six more years and skunk VA gets on the
[SPEAKER_00]: forums And that would probably remember
was that I see mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember which one he popped up on
I think he possibly mad he popped up on
[SPEAKER_00]: the forums talking shit about Cam and this
and that and everything else and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of where the skunk VA cut came from
sure the name because a lot of times back
[SPEAKER_00]: then You attributed a cut to the name of
the poster who first talked about the cut
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct, and it was super common,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was a very common nomenclature
way of talking about things Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so You know and then the I mean,
you know, there's a so anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it gets it starts to get famous Okay,
and other people realize it gets famous
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know Obviously skunk VA kind of
started the fame Chem dog gets back
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: He realizes that there's a bunch of stuff
going on about his stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe he started posting some versions
of his events right around then and
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow Peabod and Joe Brand find out
what's going on and recently just so
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody knows like they're talking about
Joe Brand I recently talked to Joe Brand
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're gonna do an interview,
but we've been having trouble like linking
[SPEAKER_01]: up the times to do it so this is being
told with his input in it basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: so when we get to the one through four
I'll start talking more about from his
[SPEAKER_01]: point of view how it went down as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I believe happened is You know
they these people started talking back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth and this was the first indication To
Peabod and Joe Brand that something had
[SPEAKER_00]: happened to some weed that they sold 15 16
years before yeah, right so and this year
[SPEAKER_00]: is 2006 2006 right now and so Joe and Chem
dog start chatting or DMing or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: the hell and Chem dog decides to give them
force give Joe Brand four seats Yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were even they even named them
the reunion seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct Yeah, because it was the
reunion because it was the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: these various characters had started
chatting again correct after 15 16 years
[SPEAKER_00]: of not talking Yeah, right and so it was
supposed to be four seats from the
[SPEAKER_00]: original bad was how the story went the
story went there were four seats from the
[SPEAKER_00]: original bad So they got popped and they
got creatively named one through four
[SPEAKER_01]: Since it was already a 3d let's do one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they were they were named one
through four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so You know the forum era was a
little bit different era in the sense that
[SPEAKER_00]: things were starting to get traded around
a little bit more Shown in rose different
[SPEAKER_00]: grows and different things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said my My buddy who brought
the clones out here was real stingy about
[SPEAKER_00]: trading cuts and especially especially
that and so Chem dog had made him promise
[SPEAKER_00]: to not really give it out beyond the tight
circle And so he kind of held to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right You know So but then obviously
there's a bunch of desire for it Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so I don't know where we want to
go from here but That's well, I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the rough story as it was told was
that's the that's the rough story So that
[SPEAKER_00]: was originally told now him dog a.k.a dog
a.k.a 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right chem sis Those are the 91 pop
Okay, some things were popped in 2000 of
[SPEAKER_00]: that the D survived and became known and
famous Yeah, and then some more things one
[SPEAKER_00]: through four were popped in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and those also became named and those
also those also started getting traded and
[SPEAKER_01]: this is where the story kind of where
where we ended up with the story when all
[SPEAKER_01]: of us started kind of researching it
pretty hard is is From taking that story
[SPEAKER_01]: that we were told that they were all from
the same bag of seeds and then growing
[SPEAKER_01]: them and over the years You know whether
me you Caleb everyone started collecting
[SPEAKER_01]: these cuts and growing them out and seeing
how that compared to the tail And that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where everything kind of starts getting
figured out over the years From Joe brand
[SPEAKER_01]: to what he had as they can one through
four what the whole really was I'll answer
[SPEAKER_00]: this question even though you're telling
me to ignore it the Joe brand cut Came
[SPEAKER_00]: because uh-huh Joe Joe brand was a it was
I don't know if he is was a hard partier
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just let's just put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He liked to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: He liked to party He liked to party on a
wide variety of stuff and he traded people
[SPEAKER_00]: After he got a hold of the chem 91 he
traded from IC collective, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no No, so It gets it gets
confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'll I'll go back to that So what
became known as the as the Joe brand cut
[SPEAKER_00]: is Joe ended up the JB cam.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started trading people Okay The chem 91
for various cuts and Lo and behold,
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't the chem 91 So he sent people
You know some people called the Joe B
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel some people called the Joe B chem
It was obviously maybe a JB 91 That's what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm referring to though.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got the cut that he was trading from IC
collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how Okay, so so here's what we'll
go so I also know I see collective and he
[SPEAKER_00]: has a different version of events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so let's tell both So why don't you
why don't you tell Joe's version?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so Joe's version is that when he
tried to get back the cuts he went to IC
[SPEAKER_01]: collective and I see collective sent him
back Kim a version of chem 91 that he
[SPEAKER_01]: thought That he may or may not have known
was the real one and Joe brand immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: started passing it out and trading it out
so Could be His uh, I see collective story
[SPEAKER_00]: is not that much different than that Okay,
so I see collective story is that he lived
[SPEAKER_00]: in Oakland at the time and he'd been in
Tahoe and stuff too, but he He had Joe
[SPEAKER_00]: brand and P bud come out to his house
Okay, and that was the first time it was
[SPEAKER_00]: an oath.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was a little bit after oh six I
think it was right around that era but
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the first time that Joe P bud and
Joe brand smoked the chem 91 Yeah was at
[SPEAKER_00]: his house then they had never seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They they make they obviously had smoked
or seen the dog bud or Whatever the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: came out of but that was the first time
they ever saw the famous cut Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, and they had the one through four
and They had the one through four and they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to trade him the D and the 91 for
the one through four Yeah, and he said no
[SPEAKER_00]: and he gave them the D, but he would not
give them the 91 Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this actually I actually kind of
believe his version of events Maybe I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I'll rewind a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cuz someone just asked where did I see
collective get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We all got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: You already said that I mean we attention
we all got we all got it from the same We
[SPEAKER_00]: all got it from Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's the one that brought it West
Skunk VA got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say not 96 ish or something like
that I see got it in 97 ish when he
[SPEAKER_00]: graduated from high school I got it in 98
ish So, you know and that was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: where it stopped So there was four people
by night late 90s that had it in
[SPEAKER_00]: California, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So So the brain had to get the Kim 91
somewhere So that so I so I know where he
[SPEAKER_00]: got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so Piba and Joe Brann were pissed
that I see would not give it to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, okay So they go to our homie CSI and
That's they gave him the one through the
[SPEAKER_00]: four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, because they were like the
originators of You know or part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: original story Yeah, they got our buddy to
give them the 91 Then they would have had
[SPEAKER_00]: the original 91 they did have the original
91 they got it from Caleb 100% and Caleb
[SPEAKER_00]: and Caleb and he's told me that himself
But you have to realize I know you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: think okay, I'm gonna say this like,
you know, Joe used to struggle I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: judging him on this but he used to he at
that time He did a lot of opiates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so he got the 91 he somehow lost the
91 and Started sending out mislabeled 91
[SPEAKER_00]: in traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so so he puts the onus on on IC
collective but reality may have been just
[SPEAKER_00]: a mislabel The reality the reality is is
that from what I see told me and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: see any reason to doubt Him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he absolutely would not give him
the cut Well, yeah, and then he definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: did and then CSI told me he absolutely did
give him the cut Okay, so I I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: think that's how they got the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't make the most sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how long Joe Brand had the
real 91 before he lost it But when he
[SPEAKER_00]: started treating people and that was that
was like my buddy from Staten Island And
[SPEAKER_00]: other people's worst fear is they didn't
want people to start trade baiting it all
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, which is exactly what Joe B and P
bud started to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's except for everyone that got the
dog from those guys didn't get the dog and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what we didn't even realize how
how off that was until I think our first
[SPEAKER_01]: real inkling of what had happened there
was when Bodhi started making crosses with
[SPEAKER_01]: the 88 g13 hash plan And then that's when
people are like, wait, what is this cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this weird cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're gonna get into this thing
obviously where you know, okay So you have
[SPEAKER_00]: you have Joe Brand and P buds version and
then you have I see Collectives his his
[SPEAKER_00]: memory of it and then you have Caleb's
memory of it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but what we know for a fact is That
these cuts started getting traded around
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst this little group.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I see and Caleb got the one
through the four Yeah, right whether it
[SPEAKER_00]: was from I see or whether it was from
Caleb or whether it was they had it for a
[SPEAKER_00]: brief time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he lost it somehow But he either was
scamming people or just had a mislabeled
[SPEAKER_00]: mom and was and had just gotten it and was
Trading it to all kinds of people for
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever else he wanted to get for his
garden Yeah, so he was blowing it out
[SPEAKER_00]: there So maybe some people got the real
dog and then later on people started
[SPEAKER_00]: getting what became known as the JB cut
Yeah You know and then people are trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to figure out what the hell the JB cut is
and it's like JB Maybe knew or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know that he was giving out a fake
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's where you know So if you
guys aren't paying attention just go back
[SPEAKER_01]: and watch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not answering questions right now
Don't even look at him not so so look at
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway you know according to You know,
and yeah, I mean that's you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the my understanding of it some people
call it the JB chem but I See collective
[SPEAKER_00]: said it was a diesel type and a shitty
diesel type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah It wasn't as good as maybe it was a
diesel bag seat or something along those
[SPEAKER_00]: lines You know, and so there's this thing
where You know this stuff ended
[SPEAKER_00]: friendships in a way like there's there's
people that I have mentioned that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to one another because of Ego around
this cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you know this day You know our buddy
CSI he didn't give it out forever and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think he waited even something like Ten
years before he started publicly selling
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah After he got it and he still gets
gets flack for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah or whatever so it seems like What
happened is so now you've got just so
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody knows you've got the chem 91
You've got the sis you've got the D and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got the one through the four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so you've got seven Actual chem cuts
Cut okay, I'm circling that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just talking about like what
supposedly came from the 13 seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're just limiting to that We're
not getting into any of its children or
[SPEAKER_00]: any shit like that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So You know, so there's so there's a
situation there where You know we and the
[SPEAKER_00]: how we got maybe I should say this how we
got the D is that You know six when all
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff was happening Chem dog didn't
no longer had the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and he hadn't had it for a long time
But when it started getting famous and
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk VA started getting rep for having
this cut he wanted it back Right,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, he wanted to have the cut that
everybody was talking about again he
[SPEAKER_00]: hadn't had it in a long time, right so
skunk VA flies out to back east and Gives
[SPEAKER_00]: it to Kim dog gives the dog back to chem
dog and he gets the D in exchange and he
[SPEAKER_00]: comes back to California and That's how me
and I see collective and some others all
[SPEAKER_00]: got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah was dude brought the D back Yeah,
okay so Yeah, you know, I mean and and so
[SPEAKER_00]: now there's so those are I think those are
like the the the basic facts of it Yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, well, that's the basic human
story of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the basic Human story of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay is that there was a couple cuts from
91 That survived there was one cut from
[SPEAKER_00]: 2000 that survived and there was There's
two cuts from oh six that survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes The one and the four are still alive
and verified the two and the three seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: be gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah There's been some fake threes that
have popped up It's one of the issues with
[SPEAKER_00]: when things that didn't get traded around
so much And they're only held by a few
[SPEAKER_00]: people, you know, and some of those people
aren't the most responsible types
[SPEAKER_00]: Accidents happen And so what we have today
as far as I know is the real 91 is alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah The sis is dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and there are some s ones that came
from the sis, but the sis is dead That's
[SPEAKER_00]: what chem dog told me and I no one seems
to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah so of the of the 91 of the 91 pop
the 91 is the only one that exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah of the 2000 pop the D is the only
thing that exists Yeah, and of the oh six
[SPEAKER_00]: pop The one and the four both exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right and Out of that obviously
there's things we haven't talked about yet
[SPEAKER_00]: like s ones and children of it and hybrids
and so on and so forth You know You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean You know, that's kind of that's
kind of the as far as I know There's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know There's four there's four living
original chem cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so now let's go back to What we
think they actually are because I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is what most people want to
know We all know the stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all heard that same rough same story
Maybe with a little additions between
[SPEAKER_01]: different people's points of view for a
long time So now we've got to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: what the fuck are these things?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the dog bud?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was uh, what likely was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so let's talk about that some of
some of what so that's that's so the The
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect around someone's talking three CSI
doesn't have three.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he doesn't just don't shut up Matt
Matt and I are both really good friends
[SPEAKER_00]: with dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He definitely doesn't he definitely does
not have it He had it at one point at long
[SPEAKER_00]: time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he had it At one point so,
you know, what's what's the best of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's preference based I suppose No,
I was I was I will just I will just say my
[SPEAKER_00]: personal preference I think the dog and
the D are two of my all-time favorite cuts
[SPEAKER_01]: not so likes the D and You like the D a
lot You know, I do I do it's it's in it's
[SPEAKER_00]: in my top It's in my top, you know the
tip, you know, and whenever I show people
[SPEAKER_01]: the D they're impressed by it They are You
know, they are impressed by it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so let's talk about let's talk
about the 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: What what's your theories on 91?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um My theory on 91 is that we will
never ever ever know What the hell it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that possibly offers us an
opportunity Is some kind of genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: testing but it comes from so long ago that
I Wonder if you'd even be able to compare
[SPEAKER_00]: it to anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can't imagine that Comparing it so
you'd have to compare to something.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing to compare it to for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so you just so let's put it this way,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said before lots of people were on
dead tour selling everything from burritos
[SPEAKER_00]: grilled cheese LSD we were right pants
clothes Everything you could imagine to
[SPEAKER_00]: make money to stay on dead tour and to go
see shows And they have a good time and to
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy life, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe brand and p-bud were some of the
people that bought and sold weed on dead
[SPEAKER_00]: tour Okay, so they were constantly imagine
you're on dead tour for several months,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just and there was three tours a year,
you know spring summer fall, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're on dead tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're buying you're buying pounds of weed
You're breaking them down into ounces and
[SPEAKER_00]: quarters and half half ounces or whatever
and you're slinging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah somewhere Amongst the sea of weed
that these guys sold over the years one
[SPEAKER_00]: sack became famous They don't remember
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm Right like they never even knew
that imagine Imagine somebody came up to
[SPEAKER_00]: you when you were a teenager and was like,
hey dude 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sold me some weed and I got some
really good shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe if you only sold one or two
Strains because that's what you grew,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd know but these guys weren't hust
these guys weren't growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were brokers Yeah, they bought weed
and they took it on tour and they sold
[SPEAKER_00]: eighths and quarters and a half ounces and
zips to pay their way and to eat and have
[SPEAKER_00]: fun and travel and whatnot, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: so Anybody saying that like oh we think it
comes from the Skelly or we think it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from this or we think It comes from the
puck or we think that's all super
[SPEAKER_00]: conjecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all super stupid in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'll say this Nothing that not the
dog itself the chem itself and none of its
[SPEAKER_01]: progeny look Like the puck it to me if
people that have a problem understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's because they don't have a basic
understanding of Afghanis like there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: many different types of Afghanis and
Doesn't it doesn't ever throw puck phenos
[SPEAKER_01]: never a putt hash plant is so much
different than Kim 91 and I've seen so
[SPEAKER_00]: different lots and lots of phenos of Hash
plant children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and none of them look like the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah None none of them look like the dog
So I have so here we have you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave a basic outline of the story that
there's a bunch of shit going on right and
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we get into the conjecture part,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the conjecture part is like is
There's an aspect where you that sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants tell you what's going on right
And you know, I've spent countless hours
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to figure out What's what's in the
dog?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay And by breeding with it, it gives you
some clues Okay, so CSI and I Both think
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's a good chance that it is
Literally an s1 or a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and the reason we think that is
because when he s ones it and he sells s1
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have a very wide genetic base
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it throws a lot of different types
of potency, but it doesn't really throw a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of different types of looks correct,
correct, you know the other thing too is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know, the puck is short and squat
and Very branchy The dog is very tall and
[SPEAKER_00]: lanky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're totally two different types of bud
structure completely completely different
[SPEAKER_00]: plant structure completely different buds
structure Totally different leaf structure
[SPEAKER_00]: totally different terpenes You know,
I think honestly, it's like people are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to shoehorn what it could be You
know, yeah into what it is So one thing
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed about trying to figure out
parentage over time the best way I've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: found to do it and it's not always it
doesn't always work So this is just a
[SPEAKER_01]: general way of speaking but for chem 91
we're having no idea of the parentage it's
[SPEAKER_01]: it holds true is when you s1 it you're
gonna see those parental phenos you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna see them and It kicks phenos that
have the same bud structure in some of its
[SPEAKER_01]: progeny in the s ones That look like sour
and sour to me is a typical super stomp
[SPEAKER_01]: type structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at some point in its history,
it's either a pure fucking Afghan tea that
[SPEAKER_01]: ended up over here an Afghan tea hybrid or
a super stunk hybrid in my opinion Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so What I can say about the I let's start
this this way what I can say about the the
[SPEAKER_00]: dog is That by modern standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not particularly pretty correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's not particularly frosty It's
kind of dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep and By looking at it you would think
it looks way midzier than most modern
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but it has super rare potency Yeah,
so as far as effect, it's an absolute
[SPEAKER_00]: champ You know, it can taste good It can
taste really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it can also taste just okay The
potency is almost always there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really really hard to mess up the
potency You know and so You know we and
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know and so these name games
happen right like I just mentioned some
[SPEAKER_00]: shit so the the the the chem dog Has gone
from chem dog to dog to skunk VA cut to
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't to chem to chem 91 Yeah,
the super skunk cut my buddy got in
[SPEAKER_00]: Virginia has gone by super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone by mass super skunk It's gone by
skunk six And it may only be two of those
[SPEAKER_01]: things it may only be super skunk and
skunk six and western mass super skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: might have been a totally I mean I can say
that you know my buddy who picked it up
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy told him it was super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it said super skunk on the label and
later on we talked to the person who read
[SPEAKER_01]: it by our friend Johnny here and He said
that it was a super skunk hybrid of sorts
[SPEAKER_00]: basically what it sounded like is he was
another kind of rainbow hippie type dude
[SPEAKER_00]: and He had some various skunks that he had
gotten from Neville You know and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: SSSC and he was crossing them back and
forth to each other and the final thing he
[SPEAKER_00]: did was he crossed that hybrid he had Into
super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's what became known as the
super skunk that is probably like I tell
[SPEAKER_01]: said earlier probably in Sour as a chem 91
hybrid me I I mean I believe strongly that
[SPEAKER_00]: it is I believe it and I have I mean I
have I have some I don't have exact
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence I have some pretty strong
evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Yeah, but so So there you go,
I mean now we have now we have that's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of the story and you know it You know,
there's conjecture what I will say is that
[SPEAKER_00]: I Find it very hard to believe that the
chem sis the chem 91 The D and the one and
[SPEAKER_00]: the four all came from the same hybrid
Yeah They're different enough that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: that there it seems to me This is where
this is where it would be amazing to have
[SPEAKER_00]: actual like human style DNA analysis Yeah,
where you you know, that was the big hope
[SPEAKER_00]: of the company that won't be named His is
that they would be able to you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: take these long-running things and clear
up these family relationships So far that
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't the case You know, I believe that
You know these things the thing is is that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are talking about can we talk about
some new stuff chasing ghosts?
[SPEAKER_00]: These aren't ghosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things are some of the backbones of
modern cannabis What we're gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about from the beginning anyways,
yeah So, you know there and you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the 90s, especially in 90 91 There
wasn't very many seed companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't as nearly As many places to
get things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it comes down to is you know,
a lot of these things that came out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 90s Became the backbone and even if you
don't Recognize them or have never had
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably had tons of things that
they're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah And let me let me throw this in
there, too so what?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I when I when I research stuff I
break things down I try to use like a
[SPEAKER_01]: logic tree like from you know philosophy
logic Like, you know you learn in college
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're still all starting on this
premise that this guy that we know that
[SPEAKER_01]: sells weed That was running low on weed
went home kept some weed for a guy he had
[SPEAKER_01]: only met once and Sent him the same exact
weed that he smoked in Colorado or
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever it was it that he had smoked it
is sent him back the last of that weed and
[SPEAKER_01]: the weed that He gave him the first time
didn't have any seeds the bad Go of weed
[SPEAKER_01]: that he had at home didn't have any seeds
But somehow that bag that Kim dot got had
[SPEAKER_01]: 13 seeds in it So there's a lot of lot of
room for human error in all of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know So we've got to start it's it is
a faulty premise from the beginning and
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you try to break it down logically
You're like, oh, yeah Yeah, Joe brandon
[SPEAKER_00]: p-bud were dudes in their 20s selling weed
to a teenager.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, yeah, and that's kind of
and the dude smoked the weed and they
[SPEAKER_00]: found some seeds, you know, I So this is
where we get to this is where we'll get to
[SPEAKER_00]: conjecture Yeah, right and we'll mix some
conjecture with facts But this isn't I
[SPEAKER_00]: said everything before and it was kind of
basic because I just wanted to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: give the timeline of fact of fact Yeah,
that's generally accepted Right now we can
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of go into what we think is in this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so I tend to think and CSI backs me
up is Is that most of the stuff out there
[SPEAKER_00]: are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hybrids of the dog or hybrids of chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, right So, you know When I People
don't know this very well, but and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: this isn't an insult and don't take this
the wrong way but after After my buddy had
[SPEAKER_00]: given chem dog the super skunk the super
skunk was legendary for herming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay, so in 1994 In 1994 The super
skunk had hermed all over Chem dog shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and chem dog called up my buddy in
California and was raving about these
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids that he had found after the Super
skunk had accidentally pollinated the dog
[SPEAKER_00]: and and it but just to inject this here
This is where I think Jesus was born in
[SPEAKER_00]: this general and he so he He loved it so
much and granted he's only you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 19 at the time or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah He loved it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started growing these hybrids
exclusively Instead of the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah in 1994, okay and so This is the weed
that he was selling And this is the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: that was getting passed out that dudes
were collecting seeds from Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay that they later popped and that
became diesel one and two yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then something in their room hermed
again and Out of those seeds people found
[SPEAKER_00]: what became sour Yeah Right There's a
there's a there's a bunch of there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of bullshit that goes along with
that or whatever, but that's You know It's
[SPEAKER_00]: hard because you know people like,
you know Clop who's definitely involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sour and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah at the time, you know Chem dog and my
buddy from Staten Island swears that no
[SPEAKER_00]: one else on the East Coast had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah He wouldn't give it to anyone on the
East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start to get different people
involved that start to claim different
[SPEAKER_00]: things at different times Most of us
obviously weren't there, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah so You know it what are you gonna say
about those type of things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another one of those things where
people start to create certainty on a
[SPEAKER_00]: series of accidents that happened when
they were young and also partying yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, yeah, and now they want to make
it all intentional and You know and so as
[SPEAKER_00]: a result You know, I can see in real sour
I can see the 91 in the Super Scunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I personally believe that's the case
like You know chem dog called my buddy and
[SPEAKER_00]: was raving about how much he liked growing
the hybrids that it accidentally got made
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that he was filling up his rooms
with them and that's all he was growing
[SPEAKER_00]: and He told him that in 1994 1994 is the
year that you know clop You know that
[SPEAKER_00]: weasel and bondo and these guys are
getting this weed that they're finding the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in You know, yeah so There you go as
far as that Goes I actually believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: the D is a chem 91 by Super Scunk hybrid
Yeah, I believe it very strongly that
[SPEAKER_01]: would make D either a sister to sour or if
it depends on which Super Scunk was used
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know there were more than one in
that I mean I I because you know we did
[SPEAKER_00]: this project called the super dog where we
tried to take the density and the potency
[SPEAKER_00]: of the chem dog and blend it with the The
look and the frost and the flavor of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Super Scunk and so I you know My buddies
from Staten Island and I worked on it for
[SPEAKER_00]: a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen a shit ton of Chem Super
Scunk hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like a shit ton I've known and so to
me like I can just see both parents in the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem D Yeah, you know, can I prove it
until we have perfect genetic testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: No It's just we can never have proof
perfect genetic testing unless we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: baselines which we don't I mean,
it's you know, it should be possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's not possible It could be
possible like, you know, like human DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could tell that You're not a sister.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a daughter Yeah, we could we could
see some relations like that, but we could
[SPEAKER_01]: never go back and say, you know But I'm
just saying like from the from the from
[SPEAKER_00]: the 91 Eventually, you should be able to
tell her these sisters or children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah From the 91 for sure, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know because we at least have
that yeah, right and so You know the and
[SPEAKER_00]: the reason why I think that is because
sometimes the D smells like Super Scunk
[SPEAKER_00]: when you crack the jar Yeah, I think that
dead rotten body nastiness that everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: always Halleotosis that they always talk
about that's kind of a rank skunk kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the D herms Sometimes like crazy in
week three and four which the Super Scunk
[SPEAKER_00]: was famous for doing Yeah in the D's case.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sterile pollen in the Super Scunk's
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super live Yeah, but I I grew you
know, I still have the the chem the chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog I've grown it for I don't know 24
years now or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew the the Super Scunk for 10 I think
that they you know, I think that the sour
[SPEAKER_00]: the base of sour is chem Super Scunk and I
think that it's very likely that That D is
[SPEAKER_01]: pure Dog and Super Scunk and and the one
that can that nobody ever mentions and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been fighting To get people to give
it its space in the family tree is diesel
[SPEAKER_01]: which I think is the pure Super Scunk just
an s1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the the you know that the diesel is
You know, like I said the the Super Scunk
[SPEAKER_00]: through live pollen both early and late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Realize that it don't hurt when you
don't make seeds after you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination Of you know of of shit it
takes a good four to six weeks for that
[SPEAKER_00]: seed to become ripe Oh, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got some late herm Unless you
let that thing ride and ride and ride and
[SPEAKER_00]: ride You're gonna have immature seeds So
the fact I don't I see I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel looks more like anything at all
like D and even in the s ones There's no D
[SPEAKER_01]: anything in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone had mentioned that so I mean what
I guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying is is that the point I was
trying to make is that for for chem dog
[SPEAKER_00]: and these guys to be pulling out Tiger
striped seeds at eight nine ten weeks A
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of times the SS was was pollinating
them through herms two three weeks into
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom Yeah, and that we have way by week
eight nine ten.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right So it's very possible that
diesel is an s1 of the straight Super
[SPEAKER_00]: Scunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and doesn't have any chem in it Oh
my gosh, okay Well, no, there's some good
[SPEAKER_01]: questions So we need to finish with with
what the one through four are all that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff first, so so yeah, so so to me the
That's what I think the D is I can't prove
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would bet money though That money
and how it breeds and how it smells and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it looks I think it's a straight Dog
SS hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I saw some people mention the one
through the four Do you think it has some
[SPEAKER_00]: nl5 haze in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's very likely after after
seeing the one I think I think it is the
[SPEAKER_01]: quintessential example of a nl5 haze
dominant phenyl In the chem one through
[SPEAKER_01]: four line like it's more it's very little
chem to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very nl5 hazy Yeah, and so,
you know, there's there's an aspect to it
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's like I just like to say this
because Once you get on the forums and
[SPEAKER_00]: once you start writing stuff and once you
start chatting about things You're sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: locked into whatever you wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I think that's been a problem
for chem dog Yeah, because people asked
[SPEAKER_00]: him what he thought and he gave what he
remembered and then people wanted like
[SPEAKER_00]: deep deep deep thoughts Yeah on how it all
went down and I don't I think he kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: spouted off as best he remembered and then
people wanted a lot of information he
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's indisputable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two of my favorite cuts that
these cuts came from dude Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, however, they were formed they
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: They exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the community They've made
amazing hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nice You know the the interesting
part about the one in the four The one is
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes like 12 or 13 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay the four takes 12 ish weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually we have a buddy pip That you know,
he takes it 84 90 days every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, it grows long running spears And so
it's really interesting because the D is a
[SPEAKER_00]: very short squat Afghan lime green Super
skunk looking thing, you know The dog is a
[SPEAKER_00]: very weird looking non frosty Afghan The
four is a super frosty long Spears like
[SPEAKER_00]: your arm 12 weaker So how do you get a
nine weaker and a 10 weaker and a 13
[SPEAKER_00]: weaker and a 12 weaker?
[SPEAKER_00]: And stuff that wants to be two feet tall
and stuff that wants to be six feet tall I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean it's possible and the ones all mercy
and dominant like no chem E dial like type
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff at all, you know, it doesn't you
know, and so what I what I think is that
[SPEAKER_00]: The D and the dog are different the dog is
the chem night 91 and the D is the chem D
[SPEAKER_00]: so So basically what we have is we have
these these various plants and to breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't look the same And they don't
They don't breed the same and their s1s
[SPEAKER_00]: don't come out the same so you would
expect if You did a bunch of s1s of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dog that you would start to see D
phenos Or four phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, or this or that if they're if
they're sisters and it's all in there
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you would expect to see those things
you'd see those phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see Jack that looks like any of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you really don't and CSI has run out
hundreds of them Yeah, and other people
[SPEAKER_01]: have run out probably thousands of CSI's
s1s too, you know And so, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that you know, I think that a lot
of them are from that You know that dog SS
[SPEAKER_00]: combo yeah, you know and so You know,
I mean the good part about it is is that
[SPEAKER_00]: the one is not is alive But it's not
really well circulated because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: look pretty enough and it takes it takes
13 weeks But the four and the dog and the
[SPEAKER_00]: D are pretty well passed out and so lots
of people have had them There's not really
[SPEAKER_00]: fakes of the four Yeah, I've never really
seen people pass fakes There's you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's been one or two fakes of the of
the actual dog, but it's not particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: common the D There's a lot of fakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of fakes and so There's some
chaos behind all that I don't know if we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get into all into all that but You
know it And what I think and This is not
[SPEAKER_00]: knocking Greg or anything or chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me By anything like that is that I
think the the fakes of the D are all
[SPEAKER_00]: sisters Personally I think he had a bag of
dog super skunk hybrids right and when he
[SPEAKER_00]: lost the D he went back in that same
little bag and popped stuff and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: those cut and because because the thing is
that's weird is that like three of the
[SPEAKER_00]: so-called fakes Can't people swear come
directly from chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Then that's probably the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the people that I know that got it
from them There's been a few people I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty sure I can trust that got things
from him labeled as D that were totally
[SPEAKER_00]: different They were they were I mean they
all swear they got it directly from dude
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it ends up not being the not
being the original D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it looks like the D Smells like the
D doesn't a lot most of them don't grow
[SPEAKER_00]: like the D if you know how the D grows and
they typically lack the Distinct flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: and the and the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but they look extremely close,
especially in a bag or in a jar is dried
[SPEAKER_00]: weed Yeah, you know and so, you know,
there's There's at least three maybe four
[SPEAKER_00]: fake DS Yeah, there's there's a lot
there's a there's quite a bit and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: those DS that got passed out later or
bought from Bought from chem dog or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever Those things got trade baited all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they got exploded everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wanted to trade the deep You
know, and so the real D kind of got buried
[SPEAKER_00]: The real became the least circulated of
the DS Yeah, it's the least circulated
[SPEAKER_00]: because and I mean this is this is this is
starting this is gonna get kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: political or whatever but like I mean we
can just say it that most of the There was
[SPEAKER_00]: a time where most of the people in
Colorado That are chem fam didn't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: real D.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was the chem sis s1 mostly went
they went through two fake DS Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they didn't even realize that they had
fake D No, you'd have to know to know they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't they didn't know and so they bred
with it and they traded it and they Grew
[SPEAKER_00]: it and sold it and all this different
stuff and it wasn't It wasn't It wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I mean in fact,
I I went to an Emerald Cup once and I had
[SPEAKER_00]: a fresh jar of real D Okay, then there's
all these people I don't need to name them
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these people that are like
fucking patting me on the back and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: being like dude You did the most amazing
job with this weed Yeah, this is
[SPEAKER_00]: unbelievable flavor and the potency you
got out of this weed is just what the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: did you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right and it turns out even though I
was kind of proud of myself For a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that the reason why they were
so blown away by the flavor and the
[SPEAKER_00]: potency was that I had the right cut and
They did not have the right cut they had a
[SPEAKER_00]: different and people were trading all
these different bags of weed around that
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't the right cut and They were amazed
when they smoked the real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know and that and so and this
and this cut and you know, it caused some
[SPEAKER_00]: embarrassment Because some of these people
are you know chem fam or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Tied in or yeah, or whatever the case
may be, you know And so, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're on you're on Instagram and you're
pontificating or whatever about like how
[SPEAKER_00]: you know everything Yeah, and then all of
a sudden you don't have the real D and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using any crosses Yeah,
and you get and you get the real D and
[SPEAKER_00]: then it turns out no, that's not real
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah right and So those fakes just got
traded so much that they drowned out the
[SPEAKER_00]: real D.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also look similar In pictures and
they look similar as dried weed They're
[SPEAKER_00]: much easier to tell when you're growing
them side-by-side and they're much easier
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell if you actually have a jar of real
D to smoke next to them and there's also
[SPEAKER_01]: the Little bit that the the fake D or the
chem sis s1 kicks live pollen Whereas that
[SPEAKER_00]: the chem D doesn't kick life, you know,
I mean I've had I've had the chem D since
[SPEAKER_00]: oh six I mean, maybe it produced a seed in
that amount of time But yeah So I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: answer that when my cut is super healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost never variegates If you can't
get your deed and not variegate,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not the real D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there you go There's like there
there people some call some of them dirty
[SPEAKER_00]: D certainly when it gets hungry I'll I'll
make people laugh and it likes cow mag It
[SPEAKER_00]: does it's the the chems are this chems are
strong eaters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sometimes If you're growing
organically or whatever else and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have some unavailability going on it
can you know, it can variegate I have
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of it variegating There's one on
my page, but when it's when it's tip-top
[SPEAKER_00]: shape and totally healthy You can really
look really close and you can see slight
[SPEAKER_00]: variegation on a leaf here and there But
other than that, you really can't see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How prone to Fox tailing is your cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: No Yeah, see that's the other the main
trait of the campus SS one if you're if
[SPEAKER_01]: your shit's real fluffy and Fox tailing
It's most likely not gonna be the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: people use Yeah, consider the original and
so there's a you know, there's I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: there's I don't know It's it's what's
what's hard about it is you want to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: the truth?
[SPEAKER_00]: The finest chem D I've smoked it it's a
nice cut it tests super high It's not the
[SPEAKER_01]: real D at all and also also taking into
account that it's been tissue cultured.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has different hormones in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's it The expression is gonna
totally be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be hard to tell I'm not I You
know, are you more skeptical on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I it's not the D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not it's not doesn't mean it's bad
I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't mean it's bad I mean,
I've had friends that have grown it that
[SPEAKER_00]: have bought it from finest and run it in
licensed gardens and stuff like that Here
[SPEAKER_00]: in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a nice cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets you super baked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the realty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know so, you know, there's and
Man, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is the point where it's like
you want to tell stories and then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, okay Well, what toes do I step on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, whose toes do I step on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why the chem story up until
this date has only been told certain ways
[SPEAKER_01]: because Like you tell this story like a
hundred percent as you as you can best
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell it with all the info that we have
available It does step on toes regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you don't want to it just yeah,
you know, like Joe Brandon people they
[SPEAKER_00]: might get mad at me for Saying that the
first time they smoked real dog was in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know But it's for a better story
the other way, but it's true They didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like people are asking them
about all this and that never they sold a
[SPEAKER_00]: bag They're very important to the story
Yeah, you know in the sense that like they
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of got it going but then they don't
tie in again for another 15 years or
[SPEAKER_00]: something You know, so it's like people
are gonna get mad and send me some DMS
[SPEAKER_00]: about whatever you know because you know
and and you know, there's an aspect to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: too Where it's like, you know,
then there's people that are, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: approaching chem dog and approaching
others They want to breed with the deep
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to breed with the chem cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want You know, they want They don't
want to get shit on for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be chem fam approved,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and some people are like,
you know And some you know, and so they
[SPEAKER_00]: grease the wheels with money and they make
it happen Yeah And I'm not blaming dude
[SPEAKER_00]: for that or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I I'm not trying to you know,
it's it's hard to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know somebody out here for a pimp
Well, you know, I mean there's there's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, obviously there's certain lines you
shouldn't cross But how you monetize
[SPEAKER_00]: things and how you do certain things like
that, like I don't really think anything
[SPEAKER_00]: dude has done is crossed any lines So,
you know, yeah the CSI chems are totally
[SPEAKER_01]: worth hunting through Yeah, we said that
like 90 times in this very very very much
[SPEAKER_00]: so the one thing that the chem 91 does
more than almost any other strain It
[SPEAKER_00]: throws potency in all of its offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does whether it's whether it out
crosses whether it's the s ones There's
[SPEAKER_00]: some s ones that are as potent or even
more potent than the mother cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know And so yeah, they're
absolutely worth hunting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're worth hunting from CSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're worth hunting from skunk VA You
know it if you have the real cut you can
[SPEAKER_00]: make some really nice really nice things
You know, exactly, you know, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's preferences too You know like as
well like I tend to think that the 91 is
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my favorite cuts of all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have Yeah, and you know and and I have
some good friends like Matt that are into
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know They give it respect for its
potency and its power and it's in its
[SPEAKER_00]: place But it's not something they would be
choosing to smoke every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah No, it fucks me up in a different
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know and so I mean, maybe we'll
maybe we'll maybe we'll say some shit
[SPEAKER_00]: about the D just because it it I mean,
maybe it should be said, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so You know, and I actually I think
it's Why is he laughing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I'm not you're telling me not to
look and I'm trying I know I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was too good anyway And I think at
times, you know chem dog hasn't been super
[SPEAKER_00]: trustworthy Not himself, but like with
some of the people he was making deals
[SPEAKER_00]: with and they're You know, there's aspects
where I think maybe he gave out things You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, he like, yeah, you know,
so I mean, you know when you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't know this because Yeah,
you know as far as I know skunk VA has the
[SPEAKER_00]: real D as far as I know I don't have
anything but good things to say about him
[SPEAKER_00]: lucky dog seed co I think You'll find good
stuff in his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He uses nice cuts Yeah in most of his
stuff, you know, so he's super transparent
[SPEAKER_01]: with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's any question I've ever had he's been
one of the most forthcoming out of all
[SPEAKER_01]: those dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh I think I think some of his some some
of his interviews and stuff have been
[SPEAKER_00]: quite honest from his perspective Yeah,
so I got nothing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: No nothing but good things to say about
About that, you know, I will say you know
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioning the Colorado thing that Almost
all those guys out there had fake D Right
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were convinced it was real D
Because they'd never had real D and they
[SPEAKER_01]: got it from Greg They got and they'll
still argue till they're blue in the face
[SPEAKER_01]: that they had the real D that it never was
the fake one Yeah, they get pissed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, yeah you know,
but I mean, you know, I I mean that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing too is it's like and then because it
got famous all these people want to jump
[SPEAKER_00]: in and you know, they and sometimes like,
you know You get paid or you make some
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with someone and then it goes bad and
you don't want to be embarrassed And so
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of shenanigans that have
gone on around it you know and You know
[SPEAKER_00]: real Kim D is much better than the finest
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's all all like but if that's
my speculation I would put I would put the
[SPEAKER_00]: real D in my probably top five all-time
strains that I like a lot for me Yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's everything though is so subjective
like we could never say that like
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's gonna think this one's better
than the other it just couldn't it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: can't do that with weed No, but I mean I
will say we talked about Matt and I talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about it a little bit on our last live You
know, I I brought some real D a few times
[SPEAKER_00]: to our to our some of our gatherings that
we would have during the Emerald Cup
[SPEAKER_00]: outside and It you know, it put a bunch of
experienced smokers on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, why did people out?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it really that I mean there was
some people that were staring at the
[SPEAKER_00]: ceiling on the couch for a number of hours
Off a couple of bong hits some people
[SPEAKER_00]: thought about going to bed early You know,
it was it was unusually strong doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean the finest cut is bad I'm not saying
that you know a lot of times people have
[SPEAKER_00]: this idea that if it's not real it can't
be good Yeah, and that's a different
[SPEAKER_00]: subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, it can be it can be not
real and good Absolutely So there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect to it where you know, I don't know
maybe we'll throw some shade or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know in Colorado You know a lot of
people don't know this and they think that
[SPEAKER_00]: that he goes back fucking forever in chem
fam or whatever But you know, you know do
[SPEAKER_00]: diamond paid chem dog a bunch of money for
the right to grow strengths Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he got He got the D and the dog and
the chem dog And whatnot from chem dog and
[SPEAKER_00]: he paid I don't know like 30 grand or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how the story goes He paid a cheap
paid a chunk of money a chunk of money for
[SPEAKER_00]: the right to have the cuts and the right
To breed with the cuts without a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know basically pay for vouching
Yeah, pay the pay for vouching,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people think that he's
he's has some deep tie or has been
[SPEAKER_00]: involved with the chems for a long time He
never came into contact with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think until he came out to
Colorado and worked with your buddy Maddie
[SPEAKER_00]: Lee, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, correct He he never I don't think
he'd ever maybe he'd smoothly Moked them
[SPEAKER_00]: before but he never had them He never had
access to them and when he wanted them he
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't get them from anyone out there
that had them So he bought them the only
[SPEAKER_00]: one I know he had early was snow dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so You know, so then, you know,
he ends up he ends up breeding Those cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: into everything because it's kind of one
of the things when he started his own seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company That was like he was rocking the
headbands and the chems super hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so my buddy I see collective he had
lost the D and He had just been out
[SPEAKER_00]: visiting Colorado and he was like,
well, why don't you send it to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like sure so they send it to him and
he grows it out And he calls him up and
[SPEAKER_00]: says you don't have real deep This is the
this is what we call the Bundy sis s1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not real deep Not even close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so for two years three years
something like that Those guys had spent
[SPEAKER_00]: all this time breeding the D and
everything they had And then they quietly
[SPEAKER_00]: had to change it to chem sis Yeah,
they never intended on on breeding with
[SPEAKER_01]: chem sis and I'll give him credit for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did actually he did change it That's I
that's all credit cuz he most people
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't even do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did he did change it You know and then
but it turned out that P bud and Duke
[SPEAKER_00]: diamond and and these other dudes out
there They all had fake D Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was it was Bundy s1 right and chem sis
Bundy It was an s1 of the real chem sis
[SPEAKER_00]: they called the Bundy cut because Bundy
was one of chem dogs growing partners And
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the people that a lot of the
growing was actually done by him He's
[SPEAKER_00]: passed away now But it was kind of named
for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's he's one of the other silent
people in the whole History of chem dog
[SPEAKER_01]: that doesn't get talked about a lot But I
think he had more to do with the the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics Aspect and the crossing and any
intentional crossing that would have been
[SPEAKER_01]: done would probably have been done by him
He had he had a bunch to do about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he was like a lot of people You know
there's there's the there's the forward
[SPEAKER_00]: guy that gets the fame And then there's
some people behind them that are doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of the work, too They don't get as
famous for whatever reason and so one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the good things about that is that That
schmuck joint breath Tricked I mean I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I can safely say Oh, yeah,
he's got to be one of the rudest
[SPEAKER_00]: motherfuckers on IG Yeah, he's a total
shitbag, but he bought he he tricked pee
[SPEAKER_00]: bud out of the dog and the chem D with
promises of Breeding and seed sales and
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration and all that and then he
turned around and just started selling
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts as fast as he could mother them And
never gave people a damn and never gave
[SPEAKER_00]: people a damn thing and told him the fuck
off and die basically And he's let some
[SPEAKER_00]: friendships everyone that he got everyone
that got The D from that dude was fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep He was selling three to five hundred
dollar cuts of fake D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that's how shit goes and the
interesting part and this is the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: why I believe that all the fake DS are
sisters to the D is That at least three of
[SPEAKER_00]: them that were absolutely positive came
from chem dog himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and they're all very similar to the
D Right, so yeah, you know to to to chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog he's never been the type to be so
militant about what strain it is when you
[SPEAKER_00]: were buying chem dog weed It was chem dog
weed because it was from chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah He used to call the D chem dog You
know you were buying chem dog weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the chem dog weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have here's chem dog weed Yeah,
you know so for people that are like
[SPEAKER_00]: sticklers about things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not your guy, you know And so he
was both the pre pre and the Kentucky
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk guy He was a lying You know,
he had the big tattoo on his neck He was
[SPEAKER_00]: super rude to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was dishonest.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lied.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stole he cheated He was very unpleasant
human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think somewhere but likely failing Yeah,
I mean whatever he was he was one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rudest and shittiest people that I
encountered on IG Yeah For those who don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know you it is very hard to get not so to
say anything about anyone That isn't a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice like the only nice thing you could
say about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have rarely ever seen Yeah, he just is
just But you know, so so that's the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: is that there was a number of people that
got a hold of chem and There's some chem
[SPEAKER_00]: people like my buddy from Staten Island
who he's retired now, but who really
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to keep it very close Yeah,
and you know and it got out and it caused
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of guff that it got out like a lot
of other strains and You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the chem cyst as far as I know and I
talked to chem dog about this Has been
[SPEAKER_00]: dead for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there are several s ones of it
supposedly that exist The real D is alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and at least three or four fakes
Yeah, you know if you have what's called
[SPEAKER_00]: the dirty D and you like I said before I
think You can't get the variegation to go
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fake and They look very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one is going to be able to tell you
that you have the real D by pictures Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very difficult It's you know when you
smoke it, you know You know, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown some of them side by side with
the real D and you can see significant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth differences is As long as you have
a control group like the real one to
[SPEAKER_00]: compare it to Yeah, you know Absolutely,
I believe that It's 91 SS and it was all
[SPEAKER_00]: accidental herms Yeah, the sour story and
the chem story is all accidental
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodism.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no intentional anything in it
Yeah, it's all accidents You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I mean I never heard Bode say a bad
word about anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really say a bad word about
anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just literally Think that like joint
breath is one of the three worst people
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met on IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah He's terrible and if you read his
comments and how he talks to people and
[SPEAKER_00]: how he breaks his word and various I don't
even want to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he just openly racist and it just is
he just has all kinds of terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: qualities Yes, and so I figured I'd
mention that because he literally turned
[SPEAKER_00]: around and started a clone business
selling chem dog and D cuts Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: as soon as he got the moms big enough that
was likely his intention the whole time
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not a stupid question when
just asked are the sour and D sisters
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know I think it's a great
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so, but only because We know
we know from the story of the sour that
[SPEAKER_00]: they got beans out of the They got beans
out of this weed from from chem dog and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was it was very likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 91 SS Yeah, so at that point,
it's already a hybrid Right It wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: it wouldn't be the SS and the dog making
seeds Yeah, and then they grew up those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and which called the diesel one and
the diesel two and then those things
[SPEAKER_00]: hermed and Out of that herm comes the
sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So do I think they're straight
sisters?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, do I think they're very closely
related?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do so there's one little part we
hadn't gotten into because it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the story but not and it's more of
a recent type thing It sounds like and
[SPEAKER_01]: this is this is putting together stuff
from skunk fa from his mentor me Caleb not
[SPEAKER_01]: to all of us really and everyone in our
can Illuminati group It sounds like at
[SPEAKER_01]: some point what was given out and taken
pictures of and hybridized as mass super
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk Might not be the same original super
skunk that came from VA and was traded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was there is that little nuance So we
should we should say this too So there's
[SPEAKER_00]: an aspect to it where like people don't
like to admit that they've that they've
[SPEAKER_00]: lost things Yeah, and so you can go look
on after this show or whatever you can go
[SPEAKER_00]: look and see those famous pics that Skunk
fa posted of the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah from 95 96 all that type of stuff and
it looks very sour like very long Spears
[SPEAKER_00]: tall lanky stretchy those type of buds the
super skunk That got passed around
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts and the stuff that was in
the high times is a much wider much
[SPEAKER_00]: thicker much shorter Afghani type yeah,
and so I think I can't say for certain
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, it's conjecture, but I think
that you know the super skunk itself and
[SPEAKER_00]: its children and its hybrids produced a
variety of seeds and Chem dog probably had
[SPEAKER_00]: a bag of this seed and a bag of that seed
the bag of some of this and People have
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to recreate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was also some bugs Involved,
you know, there was some other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was various things You know and you
know it Yeah, I tell I tell are you from
[SPEAKER_01]: that from that crew with Camilla in them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry one second Because that that is one
question I've always had whether the one
[SPEAKER_01]: that's in diesel is the one that's in sour
There was a couple there was supposedly a
[SPEAKER_00]: six and an eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know We got I guess what you
would classify as the 6 I suppose although
[SPEAKER_00]: we didn't find that out so much later But
but that was the one that got that got
[SPEAKER_00]: passed it out I'm not gonna answer which
sours better and which one is the real
[SPEAKER_00]: deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could do an entire sour episode talking
about it Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that all is knowledge from organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that guy is super I mean yeah hard
part about There the hard part about the
[SPEAKER_00]: sour crew is that you know is that people
have different memories of things?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know and weasel and Vondo And man some
of these guys they don't all agree on
[SPEAKER_01]: everything Weasel can't tell the same
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's super cool super nice I love his
listening to him talk about history and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff But he's had a very hard time being
consistent in stories from one day to the
[SPEAKER_01]: next literally like there was a podcast
maybe a week in between the two where he
[SPEAKER_01]: told completely different stories about
the history of sour so when I'm going
[SPEAKER_01]: through history and stuff when I see that
I usually toss it all out because if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: an unreliable narrator as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say this About this the sour thing
is that because the sour came out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of hermaphroditic weed Yeah,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe there was a couple cuts even
early on Right and then Vondo who was one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the guys that actually lived in the
apartment where the accident happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, when he moved west he took some
seeds with him from That initial thing
[SPEAKER_00]: west and sprouted and sprouted some and
kept a cut in Southern, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah According to him, so I think you know
I don't think that there was just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was two or three and then
You know it It became the most popular
[SPEAKER_00]: weed in America for ten years Yeah,
and then fucking rez named a strain up and
[SPEAKER_00]: named his named his personal strain after
it Sadly so who?
[SPEAKER_00]: Had the real one who had the right one
everybody thinks the real sour diesel is
[SPEAKER_00]: the whatever one they saw first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Generally speaking, you know,
no, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can say I can say this about the
sour I got the sour in 2000 And I've never
[SPEAKER_00]: lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Don't know which one it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I've had it for 22 years now so
You know, is it the first is it one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: couple, you know Luckily for us most of
the diesel cuts are nice Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know when people talk about real when
people talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I can take trace it back to 95 I can
this I can that you should buy it for
[SPEAKER_00]: $5,000 a pound because it's You know,
that's a lot of marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah to me But the sour story is confusing
You know and it gets more confusing every
[SPEAKER_01]: day when people when newer people enter
the scene and claim old heritage on their
[SPEAKER_01]: sour cut and You know, a lot of people are
still depressed Over the past five six
[SPEAKER_01]: years and they don't know these people are
new it just conflates it more and over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago It's gotten even fucking
crazier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and and so there's a thing too where
it's like there's a lot of people that had
[SPEAKER_00]: sour back in the day and They got rid of
sour Yeah, and then they got it back and
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't the same one So it's very
difficult the vast majority of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I see You know, I see people
chatting about this or whatever I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know if people remember I'm not even
calling dude out But if people remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Jay Plantspeaker went through a
two or three year period where he thought
[SPEAKER_00]: that like seeds You know only growing from
seed was the way and the clones were bunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know He's very you had probably had
he's deleted them all now, but he's had
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of posts about it He was super
into seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market changed on him and you know in
2017 or something he got that sour back
[SPEAKER_00]: You know and so he he's had the south he's
had the sour about four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, does that mean that?
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't he had it in the past at some
point, you know But most people had to get
[SPEAKER_00]: it back because they moved on to other
shit Yeah, and that's how a lot of things
[SPEAKER_00]: get lost is people are like, oh,
I don't need that right now homies got it
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just get it back whenever and then
they keep getting back the thing that they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, so I mean I Have this thing
and it's expensive and it kind of sucks at
[SPEAKER_00]: times, but I like to keep weed that I like
Yeah You know And so some of these things
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just kept for a long time like if I
lost my sour I would never Be able I all
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones I've gathered aren't the one that
I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know if I lost the real D I mean,
I know a couple people thank God But like
[SPEAKER_00]: if I was trying to find it like one of you
guys out there in the community It would
[SPEAKER_00]: be really fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because there's more fakes than not
You know and so, you know AJ doesn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: The cut that AJ grows and moves now isn't
the cut that people got as AJ's 20 years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago Yeah, no is it I I don't speak to that
personally at the first Adam Duncup when
[SPEAKER_01]: he brought out his AJ sour We were all
standing around just expecting because it
[SPEAKER_01]: was one of the first times he'd come out
in quite a while and he was there with JJ
[SPEAKER_01]: and he brought out this jar and Said this
is my sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're all kind of hanging around it
Let's see what his bucket what AJ's grown
[SPEAKER_01]: sour looks like and I shit you not
everybody Just kind of took a whiff of it
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was not it was not sour as we
know it it was very very different Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know been a really bad here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may have been any numbers things,
but yeah, I don't know I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's people that have the modern AJ
sour cut Yeah, and there's people that
[SPEAKER_00]: have an AJ sour cut from long ago and
they're not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: No Big worm had a older AJ sour cut and it
was dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smelled Like sour, you know,
but I've had I've smelled a chase new sour
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is not the same thing People are
saying does anyone else have and work the
[SPEAKER_00]: same sour that you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know How how could I know yeah,
you know, I mean I I don't know I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: people call my headband not so his
headband because I seem to be one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: only people that kept it Yeah,
it's not like it's mine but people are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure out some way to name it
and head there's like eight headbands or
[SPEAKER_00]: something so You know it you know,
there's an aspect to it where What's real
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah You know deep you know, there's
there's got to be five or six years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with Matt and some of our friends on
our discord and stuff like that and back
[SPEAKER_00]: and forth We started chatting about
aspects and they kept asking me which sour
[SPEAKER_00]: is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the Choco?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the res cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the AJ?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The the East Coast sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the shroomy cut it Amish?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's so many and I was like,
I don't fucking know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea I have no idea what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I never got any of those because I
Got this hour long ago and never lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I had this hour So why the
fuck would I trade someone else for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: so I start collecting these things and I
get the New York City diesel and I get the
[SPEAKER_00]: East Coast sour diesel and I get the The
Amish and this and this and this and this
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm like Okay, I'm gonna figure out
which one mine is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I grow them all out and none of
them are mine So I was like, oh You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems like the East Coast sour diesel
or what some people call the East Coast
[SPEAKER_01]: sour diesel and the Choco are the same
Yeah, I was the one who named it Choco cut
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was only because when people would
ask me like hey Which cut is yours?
[SPEAKER_01]: Choco had the best representation and grow
and so did Cobb for that matter and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: the best representation and grow that's
insane
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I you know, I tend to like,
you know, this might sound self-serving or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever I like the one that I have the
best Yeah, and I like the one I had best,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I like that one the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that the one that my but our
buddy PIP gave me that there was ECSD
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was the mother of the Death Star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like as much but yeah,
I I like that one a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the people say s1 your sour
the reason why Sour is notorious for not
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing pollen Yeah, you know it you can
horrible you can cross things To it right
[SPEAKER_00]: and Amish is the Pennsylvania one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it got called Amish because of
that so there's you know, we've had
[SPEAKER_00]: friends that have reversed the sour and
Gotten like 15 seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if that it's we've had friends
reverse the sour multiple times and
[SPEAKER_01]: completely fucking fail and people that
are pretty proficient at reversing not
[SPEAKER_00]: just me but others and Yeah, just not and
CSI various other friends A PIP,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know reverse some and literally got
like a personal amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and reversing stuff and having it
fail is expensive So, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very difficult to so there's and you
know and sour is a wide ver is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's like everyone How do I put
this the right way everyone claims to like
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity But they still want to find the
fire in every pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so you start selling some sour
hybrids Start throwing a bunch of a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of junk Amongst the gold and people are
pissed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because they don't want to buy a
hundred seeds to find a couple that are
[SPEAKER_00]: fire Yeah, you know, so sour has been a
difficult breeder and it doesn't s1 It
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't seem any of the cuts s1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, which is why you rarely ever
see Sour s1s for sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you do you should probably know
fucking side-eye in that shit most often
[SPEAKER_00]: the the sour cuts That are sold or high up
there that are reversed or something was
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed onto them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it takes pollen fine Yeah,
it makes you know, I make seed it makes
[SPEAKER_01]: hella seed with that blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes But you know making seed of itself not
so not not so simple Not so not so not so
[SPEAKER_00]: simple as far as that go I you know,
honestly, dude, there's there's another
[SPEAKER_00]: question I People think I hoard I don't
hoard But I just sucks at passing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I don't I don't suck at passing
either What I suck at is I don't I I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: like to mail Yes, I'm very I'm very in
person Yeah, like if if we can meet that's
[SPEAKER_00]: good if I have to mail you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I'm not good Try to meet at truck
stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get it, you know, and so people
are saying Deathcoast diesel Deathcoast
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel from pip pip it I'll say this in in
in full disclosure I'm biased because pip
[SPEAKER_00]: is my good buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah both of our good buddies So take that
as you will, but I will say that his
[SPEAKER_00]: sourine There's a number of his hybrids
that a lot of fire has been found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah His rubber city his sourine some of
his other sour work, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's my good friend He cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has real nice cuts and Yeah,
he's as serious about provenance as any of
[SPEAKER_01]: us like he is very serious about it
getting it right and But yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a there's a bunch of people And I
don't want to I don't want to judge
[SPEAKER_00]: people, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a bunch of people that
monetize their access to cuts Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sell cuts to whoever to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never sold cuts to make money I give
cuts to my personal friends so People
[SPEAKER_00]: would be like, oh you're a fucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're you don't give your headband out
and I'll be like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like half my crew lived off the headband
for years Yeah, you know like if you're my
[SPEAKER_00]: personal friend and we're good buddies and
or you know, whatever like I tend to share
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're not like and you're like,
hey, can I just buy this thing off you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just I've just never monetized cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've given and I'm not even judging I'm
just saying that like I typically give I
[SPEAKER_00]: typically trade with people that I think
are like have have a good heart and You
[SPEAKER_00]: weed the same way that I do You know And
so, you know, that's it's I don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: sell cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not I'm not hyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other part of it Right is that
I don't I don't like I'm not hyping it for
[SPEAKER_00]: you to buy anything for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know Original D is a tough one to
find info on because I did a live feed
[SPEAKER_01]: just trying to show how to find info on
something and use that as an example I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't Trace the day record.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't trace it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't trace it back past a certain point
and it's it's frustrating because it's one
[SPEAKER_00]: of my favorite cuts So I'll say this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sour has a super confusing story
Because the people involved don't all
[SPEAKER_00]: agree exactly what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and Well Duke also someone saying
what headband is Duke using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Duke is in a federal halfway house getting
out of the clink.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not using anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't have any plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not breathing Anything the cut he had
before is what we call the the 56 day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an og type He never had the LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never had a day record.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never had anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he doesn't have anything right now,
but he so So there's an aspect where
[SPEAKER_00]: before I lose my train of thought the sour
story is tough because Everybody back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the day got their sour cut helpfully
labeled sour D Yeah, all these other names
[SPEAKER_00]: came about when the forums happened So
much later than that Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and res dog fucking made a made a
line of seed called sour D and sour was
[SPEAKER_00]: super popular But we know quite a bit
about the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just can't figure everything out
because people don't agree Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: the headband story is basically a total
fucking mystery People pop up here and
[SPEAKER_00]: there and People pop up here and there and
say oh I know but who did it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who named it how they do it I can I can
say this I got my headband cut in in very
[SPEAKER_00]: early 2000s and I've never lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, it's a diesel type, okay The what
people call the 56 day is a renamed og
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush Yes, there was violence in the Kush
family down in Southern, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: A guy fled to the bay with that cut He
wanted to grow and sell that cut he didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: want the stress of whatever was happening
in Southern, California to follow him They
[SPEAKER_00]: decided they were going to rename the cut
They decided on the name headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, and a dude in the bay a dude in the
bay What gave out a mislabeled tray of
[SPEAKER_00]: that headband yeah, and that's how Bob
Hemp Hill I see collective myself Right
[SPEAKER_00]: around oh five or six or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all got it Yeah, Loompa headband is
also likely a renamed og Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he'll get super pissed at me for
saying this but it didn't pop up until
[SPEAKER_01]: about oh eight or oh nine Yeah,
you can get pissed off you once but that's
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just that from him back when
we were close He would say it's just a
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking og.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's it's likely an og s1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know it it popped up by the time
that he was talking on the forums about
[SPEAKER_00]: having it I'd had my my headband for eight
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, something like that I've been trying
to look for information on exactly what my
[SPEAKER_00]: headband is for 20 some years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not easy Yeah, it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a certain things that the headband
is a very mysterious story The 707
[SPEAKER_00]: headband is the child.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was made by Mandelbrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the child of my headband cut And my
headband cut was actually passed out quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit in Humboldt Mendo But it's really
finicky and a pain in the ass and people
[SPEAKER_00]: got rid of it because sour was easier to
grow Yeah So that's that's the deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: the 707 the 707 Mandelbrot took the LA the
the LA cut which we call it the headband
[SPEAKER_00]: cut and crossed into an Afghan and sold it
as the 707 he made it in Humboldt that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the area code up here in Humboldt Mendo,
so that's why he called it the 707 and
[SPEAKER_01]: after post swerve releasing his sour og
Almost every single cut that was found
[SPEAKER_01]: from that was called something headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point I mean, I've actually
I've actually wondered if my headband cut
[SPEAKER_00]: is From the sour seeds that Vondo popped
in LA could be yeah He told me he popped
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and he got a really nice phenol of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's complete conjecture But you know,
I it's very closely related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but actual information It's kind of
like when we talked on the live actual
[SPEAKER_00]: information about Urkel the who the what
the where and the how No, yeah people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know nothing definitive nothing
definitive people have a shit ton of names
[SPEAKER_00]: that they applied a way too many cuts day
wrecker You know original boy original,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Loompa this that whatever Underdog go The
underdog og I don't know under dog og is
[SPEAKER_01]: just Loompa's headband renamed It's all
the same shit all of it's the same shit
[SPEAKER_01]: and a candy cut the fire bomb indica
Hawaiian headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's had so many fun actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say this Loompa You know Loompa was
very open with his friends that he renamed
[SPEAKER_00]: the Loompa headband Whatever he wanted to
to market it at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he gave it He said he gave it using
causes sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he he gave it four or five different
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a great It's it's very it's a
shitty breeder None of my friends it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very inconsistent and But it's a nice
cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely gets you high definitely
That was I expected a lot more diversity
[SPEAKER_01]: with the bonnet, but it made some fire
shit with the bonnet But I've had other
[SPEAKER_01]: Loompa's headband crosses that were just
shit bombs And it's just inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the stuff with all the stuff with
sour and headband and the diesel family
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some fact and there's some
conjecture and I doubt You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I I doubt that it'll ever be completely
cleared up Yeah, even the guys involved
[SPEAKER_00]: don't all agree and as Matt mentioned
before weasel or whatever You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's talked and written multiple different
stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was a guy that was wanted to
ask about Origins TK or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another one where the same
gentleman has written three completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different stories different strains
different years slightly different
[SPEAKER_00]: versions and So even if you want to
believe that one of those versions is
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't all be true Yeah, they can't
all be true and in his he's just seems to
[SPEAKER_01]: be more More sure about what it was than
he was in the past I think that's the best
[SPEAKER_00]: way and in the in the beginning he said in
1994 he got hired by the guys that he was
[SPEAKER_00]: he was being paid for to grow to go to
Amsterdam and mule some seeds back and
[SPEAKER_00]: they bought half a dozen different seed
packs and They grew it all in this 12
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter and it hurt and one of them they
missed a male or it hermed on this
[SPEAKER_00]: Triangle that they called the triangle
because it was from the triangle area
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then he told us a couple he was
on our discord a little a few years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told us that he went there in 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know his current story was he
went there in 89 Yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so he's he's he's written three completely
different stories with different times
[SPEAKER_00]: different plants different strains listed
So I mean, what do you do with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: The same dude has three versions of
events, you know You know, I my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: og I Think a lot of the og's are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they're a lot different than
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never understood la's fascination with
40 different cuts of og and having fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries filled with 27 different
types of the same fucking thing Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to think the oldest ones are good
The TK I like a lot Certainly like the TKS
[SPEAKER_00]: ones from CSI are amazing I like the flow
rider, which I got early so you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I You know, there's a there's a lot of
stuff that goes on with that that Famous
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts that's what happens with famous cuts
people rename them People get bad bag
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and put their own name on them,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: People call them different names to sell
them to different groups of people Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: who you get it from it basis what name you
call it because that's who they called it
[SPEAKER_00]: the ghost og The ghost og that's traded
today isn't the ghost og that was traded
[SPEAKER_00]: long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Not the same cut at all a ghost that
goes around his ghost isn't even the same
[SPEAKER_00]: ghost The ghost that goes around his ghost
now isn't the original ghost that was
[SPEAKER_00]: getting passed out And that original ghost
was getting sold to people for 30 to 50
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand dollars a cut I'm talking about
the guy that goes around his ghost isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even the same Yeah, the guy the guy goes
throw isn't even the reason even the
[SPEAKER_00]: original ghost that actually traded it in
the very beginning Yeah, that's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: person that cut was named after chem 91 is
is I Mean you could call it very bland I
[SPEAKER_00]: suppose I will say I said it before that
Not always does the flavor pop on chem 91
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency and the effect for me is
almost always there the flavor that I like
[SPEAKER_01]: comes out about once every three reps So I
and I've talked about my favorite chem 91
[SPEAKER_01]: version Was a chem 91 hybrid from elite
cannabis and the reason I liked it so much
[SPEAKER_01]: was because it was true to the chem 91
looks Smell was more more terpy and the
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor was So fucking insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if any of you guys can get a hold of
resurrection, it's a great chem 91 seed
[SPEAKER_00]: line You know chem 91 is like chem 91 is
actually quite a bit like sour Sour can be
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty fucking hard to nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you get it to reach its genetic
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is absolutely bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Very midsy before myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean there was I I believe I I'll
answer I'll answer dude cuz he's tied into
[SPEAKER_00]: homie, but yeah, I see collective I
believe he got the dog the 91 in 1997
[SPEAKER_00]: right after he graduated high school He
moved in with skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and they lived together He skunk VA
was growing and that was the first place
[SPEAKER_00]: that I see collective lived outside of
Outside of his parents house, you know And
[SPEAKER_00]: so yeah, he got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got it right around 1997 and that was
multiple years before any of us saw og
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean even if you listen to like
Bubba Kush's story and those guys I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think they even moved west until 1996
Okay, I got a question for you not so yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: How likely do you think it is that
Northern Lights is responsible in any way
[SPEAKER_01]: for chem 91?
[SPEAKER_00]: I Think that it's a reasonably good chance
interesting I can't post it here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I was talking before about our buddy
pip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and pip had a 88 day chem 4 yeah,
okay that he had put on that he had just
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten done and I had him open an 89
catalog of the seed bank Neville's Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: seed bank and put it right next to a bud
of nl5 haze and It was like it it was
[SPEAKER_00]: really close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so you're referring to chem 4 being
probably at it, but how about chem 91 I
[SPEAKER_00]: think It's a reasonable chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean CSI not in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I mean which which NL I mean look in
1990 1991 NL was one of the most common
[SPEAKER_00]: things you could buy Yeah, there was nl1.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nl2.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nl5 There was multiple hybrids
of each so Do I think that do I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do I think it I think nl and skunk
and haze are likely in most things Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least one of the three and sometimes I
tend to disagree on on nl5 being in chem
[SPEAKER_01]: 91 only because it's so it's so Uniform
and stable was no you didn't say no five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think nl is in appear Okay, but I still
think it's more likely gonna be an Afghan
[SPEAKER_01]: T descendant It could be it could be
entirely possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it could move it out Of the nl
range personally, but but that but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm saying is that you know We're
going on 31 years now since the seed has
[SPEAKER_00]: popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's all this part is all theory You
could you could sit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know that it came from dog bud We
don't know if it came from the dog bud
[SPEAKER_00]: that was sold on the lot to chem dog We
don't know if it came from weed later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know shit Yeah, we know some weed
sold on dead tour led to the chem 91 Yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what we know yeah, and it was given
it was the weed was sold to a 17 year old
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, by some early 20 something weed
hustlers In a parking lot yeah out of out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the car at a dead show So not exactly
You know yeah the closest thing that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: ever seen to 91 in just growing general
Afghani different types There was an old
[SPEAKER_01]: and bizarre land race that Soma was
selling and I think DNA sold it as Afghan
[SPEAKER_01]: some kind of Afghan For a while they were
relabeling it, but it was an old bizarre
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was very herm-prone and it grew
very much like chem 91 endless white
[SPEAKER_01]: pistols Had a little bit of the leaf
cannibalization stuff Just the general
[SPEAKER_01]: structure resin production and then the
Afghani one has a lot of similar traits
[SPEAKER_01]: which for a long time I thought it's got
to be an Afghani one for sure don't tell
[SPEAKER_01]: the Afghani stuff kind of came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll throw some Something that that throw
threw me for a loop at one of our little
[SPEAKER_00]: canna Illuminati canna Illuminati parties
that we threw during the Emerald Cup CSI
[SPEAKER_00]: came down and was hanging out with us that
weekend and him and I had a long chat
[SPEAKER_00]: about whether or not Chem 91 could be an
s1 from nl5 haze Yeah, and it kind of blew
[SPEAKER_00]: my mind because I'd never really
considered it, but it does have rare
[SPEAKER_00]: potency It is tall it does take a long
time for an Afghan Yeah, we do start these
[SPEAKER_00]: lives late.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't help it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's late and But that's the way it goes
Elite cannabis from Colorado is legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, very much so and so so, you know
Caleb Caleb wondered, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: could it have been an s1?
[SPEAKER_00]: From nl5 haze and it just leaned toward
the nl side and that then you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he thinks it's an s1 of something not
a Full hybrid just because of the narrow
[SPEAKER_00]: range of phenos it throws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like it kind of throws itself Yeah,
and so from a breeding perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a really good hint that it's Self
self.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good hint, but I do not
believe ever I think the only path to any
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of certainty is eventually DNA
testing That is as accurate as human DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I have no idea when that is
going to pop up Sure wasn't phylose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not going to get any amazing new
information from Joe brand or p-bud or
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dog or anyone that clarifies it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah We're just not You know, so That's
not a diss on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just you know, a bag of weed was sold
that you know, I mean You know everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: wishes that like some of the most
important things you ever do you'd realize
[SPEAKER_00]: it was one of the most Important ever
things you'd ever do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but sometimes it's just Friday
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sometimes that ain't how it is You
know While we still have people in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna say I'm gonna throw up some
auctions at the very end on my website
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily the websites back up running.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got credit card acceptance the sprays
up there to get you can We have cash for
[SPEAKER_01]: money order ready to rock I'll throw some
auctions up there for Something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what but it'll probably be
breeders packs of stuff I might do the the
[SPEAKER_01]: blue sour breeders packs because it's a
very it's very true breeding to the sour
[SPEAKER_01]: side as opposed to very doesn't come
through so much and I might do maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: pack of the Sourdough cross to G's or
something like that where it's very super
[SPEAKER_01]: strong Super stock dominance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to plug that in there right
tco.com and Go check out speakeasy seed
[SPEAKER_01]: bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also have some other stuff up there
Yeah, so now we got that done if you want
[SPEAKER_01]: options go there after this back to the
story People are talking about can you
[SPEAKER_00]: just get a grow license and and do it all
legally?
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with getting a grow license
and doing it all legally is that then it
[SPEAKER_00]: creating right now it incurs so much
Expenses to go legal and just about any
[SPEAKER_00]: state that it makes it really difficult
for people to just wildly experiment with
[SPEAKER_00]: no financial benefit yeah, it would be
amazing if that was the case and Legality
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping for a while would really open
things up But it's kind of limited things
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way You know because it's got it's so
financially expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really have to win It's gonna be less
and less coming up because with more with
[SPEAKER_01]: more Laws going down about space having
plants you can grow all that it's good
[SPEAKER_01]: There's gonna be a lot less playing time,
you know I mean people say just said
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma even in Oklahoma most of the
people that are out in Oklahoma that that
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing it cheap They're blowing it up
right now to make a bunch of money Most
[SPEAKER_00]: people in Oklahoma went there and lost
that's that's why I mean That's the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that people want to know like is that all
the all the breeding that I did for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time Was financially very stupid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Because I could have taken this I
could have taken that same space and
[SPEAKER_00]: pumped out weed that sold for way more
Yeah, you know way more, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so that's why that's honestly why Like
so much stuff comes from like a relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: small group of people Yeah, because most
people if they're given the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow weed They just try to grow as much
weed as they can of something that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: them the most money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah And especially 20 years ago when I
was doing a lot of my breeding Before
[SPEAKER_00]: before you could monetize like with IG and
all these different things and you could
[SPEAKER_00]: be a little personal American breeder
Yeah, like breeding was like a labor of
[SPEAKER_00]: love You know my buddy from Staten Island
talked about You know how many seeds you
[SPEAKER_00]: could make in a in an eight lighter versus
how many pounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and he was like man if we could just
sell these even for a dollar or two We
[SPEAKER_00]: could wait way more money than that eight
lighter could make yeah But we didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the infrastructure or the internet or the
this or that or whatever in order to like
[SPEAKER_00]: actually like You know, and then even when
we did get the internet I was on the
[SPEAKER_00]: forums during the cannabis world and over
grow era and then they busted heavens get
[SPEAKER_00]: heaven's stairway and they shut all that
shit down and a bunch of people got in
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble and I kind of hid on the forums
until IG yeah, because I wasn't a computer
[SPEAKER_00]: expert and I wasn't good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't gonna be like masking my IP
address and masking this and hiding like I
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't computer savvy and You're still not
computer savvy.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I just mean in the sense of like
trying to get away with like selling a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of illegal shit People I met on the
internet It didn't seem it didn't seem it
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't seem wise even when I got into it I
was one of the first people to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: worldwide from the US and Everybody
thought I was a fucking idiot for doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: and I probably was you know Like it was
more risk and I should have taken at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time But yeah that even the idea of that
just wasn't happening even when I came
[SPEAKER_01]: into it, which is much later than you And
it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'll say this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I you know, I don't want to say like,
you know some people might Interpret when
[SPEAKER_00]: you talk about truth or you talk about
your opinion There's a there's a real
[SPEAKER_00]: common thing right now where people talk
about oh, you're a hater or oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're dissing me or something like yeah
I'm not really trying to do that to most
[SPEAKER_00]: people when it comes down to it but you
know people have their version of events
[SPEAKER_00]: and people have their version of truth and
most of the time People only tell you the
[SPEAKER_00]: truth in cannabis if it financially
benefits them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot of things that are
sort of like commonly known amongst the
[SPEAKER_00]: tight circles that don't get put out to
the Common I don't want to say commons
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong word but to the masses because they
don't want the blowback Yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't want they don't want the
attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want the you know, you're
calling me a liar Oh, you're saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: like something I said once was
inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we were bros You're supposed to
back me up Yeah, and that's how a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff stays secret and that's why it took
this long for a lot of this to even Come
[SPEAKER_00]: out would I collab with Bodhi?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure Bodhi is again.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a fucking Lobo Bodhi is a good friend
of both of ours You know, I yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I am most of the time honestly,
I You know, I I use flour to survive and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds were the passion Yeah for some
people it's reversed and seeds are the way
[SPEAKER_00]: to survive and the flowers the passion,
you know I grew I grew flour to survive So
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds were I mean I gave away I haven't
really sold seeds, but I gave thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: and thousands of them away Yeah,
and entire seed companies were created off
[SPEAKER_00]: of it Because back then the goal to be
Frank wasn't uh Wasn't rapper money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was trying to make better weed We
didn't think there was any money in seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, do it do we think the
dankity dank is gonna disappear it could
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a real it's under real risk
because the powers that be don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: care about as you put it dankity dank
Yeah, a lot of money that spends dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: with companies You're you you're using
your dollars like votes It granted is not
[SPEAKER_01]: a political process But it kind of is and
if you keep supporting companies that keep
[SPEAKER_01]: doing these like non-stop gelato hybrids
cookies Oh my god, let me enter let me
[SPEAKER_00]: interject sure since he does get a bad rap
these days and it's well Deserved because
[SPEAKER_00]: sensi outsourced all of their work to
Spain Yeah, they are they are not the
[SPEAKER_00]: legends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were in the 90s Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: They I don't know what what else they
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much they have that's
real I know they got busted in 1999 2000
[SPEAKER_00]: and they moved their operation out of
Holland and to Spain and They get third
[SPEAKER_00]: parties to make their seats Could they
have one or two strains among there?
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent to those people and they have
and it's semi what it was I suppose But
[SPEAKER_00]: they sell everything That they used to
sell they even use the same fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures that Neville had in his seed
catalog from the 80s They have not they
[SPEAKER_00]: have not updated their pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 30 plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah ever Yeah, that's you know,
I Mean, you know You know if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: better weed Cross things that you like
together Give out seeds to your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on to seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on to clones that you think work
really good for you Try to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: friends to back them up, too You know,
I mean that's that's really the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: The dankity dank will survive better weed
will survive if people make it a point
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it's financially expensive to
them, you know to Keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, that's really what's gonna
go down to so do you think we hit all the
[SPEAKER_01]: salient points of the the chem stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm gonna try to keep it in that
region for a good podcast audio podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we kept we can go I mean even like
when we went off on sour and headband and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff I consider that chem family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's still all very relevant You
know and so But yeah, I mean basically
[SPEAKER_00]: what it boils down to is that chem dog
Through a series of accidents and sheer
[SPEAKER_00]: luck Some really really incredible strains
came out of his little circle Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think honestly he's more of a
glassblower than he is a breeder nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't say that I don't mean that in a
bad way people I don't know sure people
[SPEAKER_00]: have different interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a very talented glassblower for sure
got him him being able to share some of
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff with my buddy from Staten
Island and Share it with other people and
[SPEAKER_00]: have some herm accidents Happened kind of
changed the face of cannabis it did and so
[SPEAKER_00]: He deserves a lot of credit for that
because he as a teenager was growing weed
[SPEAKER_00]: in a totally illegal state and an
undergoing risk Yeah, and so if I've said
[SPEAKER_00]: some things that counter contradicts his
like official word or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not dissing him You know on any level
he contributed a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know People want you know
imagine if someone asked you to remember
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 or 15 or 20 years ago Exactly what
happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: And imagine you had three friends in the
room and they put you all in separate
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms And they asked you to remember the
exact story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's gonna be differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah For sure and people's memories change
You know, yeah, and there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people who tried to change the story for
their own good later on They weren't even
[SPEAKER_01]: a part of the original curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah Yeah, I mean so now you have a lot
of things where you know chem family gets
[SPEAKER_00]: thrown around and this gets thrown around
and You know, it's like the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are that are most involved you know,
like my buddy from Staten Island or even I
[SPEAKER_00]: see collective or You know, I you know for
a long time skunk VA But I guess you did a
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast or two and kind of enlightened
things The the vocal ones were the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that were the least involved Yeah,
and the quiet ones happened to be the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that had the most to do with it I didn't I
wasn't involved for shit except where I
[SPEAKER_00]: got them super early and I Kept helped
keep them alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah you know so You know it and
everyone's version everyone's version of
[SPEAKER_00]: events you can weave into the rest of the
people's events Yeah, and in some cases
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a situation where you just have
to pick who you believe That's sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: what it boils down to you know,
I mean You know, I mean we we have we have
[SPEAKER_00]: debates all the time and and and They'll
be like I can't believe you you believe
[SPEAKER_00]: that asshole and I'm like well the asshole
that you believe I don't believe either
[SPEAKER_01]: You know and as you can tell like me and
not so don't even necessarily agree on
[SPEAKER_01]: what the what it could be what it's You
know the beginnings there's still stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that we don't necessarily agree on and
that we will debate like head-to-head all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time because we're fucking nerds like
that, but yeah Same with CSI same same
[SPEAKER_00]: with any number of different friends
people have their different ideas And you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, like I said, there's there's fact
and there's conjecture, you know And I try
[SPEAKER_00]: to be clear when you venture from one to
the other You know, so But I do think that
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the information out there matters
because as things legalize and things go
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of cool stories in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll just be lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah So we're gonna try to keep
documenting them as best we can Hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: this was enlightening for all of you or
some people, you know, I hope you I hope
[SPEAKER_01]: you enjoyed it and of course we talk all
the time in the breeder syndicate discord
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find that going to Google and you
can type in breeder syndicate patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can join through there It's five
dollars a month and we all hang out shoot
[SPEAKER_01]: the shit in there watch fights and talk a
lot about weed history The current
[SPEAKER_01]: political goings on in weed be that
different breeders Different strains what
[SPEAKER_01]: have you not those in there, too?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's on he's a hard person to access on
Instagram because I mean, he's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: got a million fucking Queue of waiting
people to approve and he doesn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: memorize who's who and people like to
report accounts So it's it's a you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's a easy way to catch him is in
the discord That isn't it's it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: communicative IG used to be better when it
was when it was time based and Before
[SPEAKER_00]: shadow banning and all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it's not what it used to be
that's in terms of a community
[SPEAKER_00]: Communication tool at least yeah and so,
you know, and you know You got kids and
[SPEAKER_00]: lives and things and this and that but I
do think it's important to come out and
[SPEAKER_00]: like say and have community And a lot of a
lot of a lot of unfortunately a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts and a lot of things are sort of
like Like an infomercial about the person
[SPEAKER_00]: or their own personal company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah There's not a lot going on where
people just want to talk about history or
[SPEAKER_00]: people just want to talk about various
aspects That don't benefit them or don't
[SPEAKER_00]: burnish their legend, you know,
and so I think we need some more of that
[SPEAKER_01]: just in general Yeah, and to finish this
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget about right at seedco.com
Because if you don't support the real ones
[SPEAKER_00]: then it makes it much harder for real ones
to exist Thanks for coming on not so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: always always Friday night is a good night
to do this for me I think I think we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: try to make this a regular thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enjoy everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy your weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace You You
