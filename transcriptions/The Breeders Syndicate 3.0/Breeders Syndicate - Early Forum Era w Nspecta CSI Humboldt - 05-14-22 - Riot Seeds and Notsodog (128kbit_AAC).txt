little bit more but not much It's a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: smaller in this place as far as that
house, but the property is big.
[SPEAKER_06]: So kind of stoked on that Tonight we will
be covering.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what are you smoking expels tonight?
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be covering the four of the era
post 2006 which really was I mean I chose
[SPEAKER_06]: that because that's when I come in.
[SPEAKER_06]: So mostly the tail end of overgrow
Cannabis world a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I Don't remember when planet gonja dipped
out Some grass city troll it up Pop pimp
[SPEAKER_06]: trike home Kings The farter Stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a cd post up it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I see mag of course There's a big
point to it too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's that a lot of people like they
weren't around during the forums It's
[SPEAKER_06]: really easy to tell who they are and the
ones that pretend like they were it's also
[SPEAKER_06]: really easy to tell that they were because
or that they weren't because they only
[SPEAKER_06]: reference the ones that are still up and
only quote the forms that are still up
[SPEAKER_06]: which was a very very I Can't I can't
mention that one sub Rob since it's
[SPEAKER_06]: private.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to mention it try to follow
rules on that one, but Yeah, I mean if
[SPEAKER_06]: people try to quote stuff all the time But
you're only seeing a brief glimpse of what
[SPEAKER_06]: happened back then some of the most
salacious fucking horrible shit Went down
[SPEAKER_06]: on on sites like seed Depot where a lot of
people started popping up a lot of people
[SPEAKER_06]: that are selling seeds are popping up on
seed Depot And I'm sure they are super
[SPEAKER_06]: stoked that you can't find that shit But
we do have the way back machine and I
[SPEAKER_06]: actually haven't tested that for seed
Depot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see Yeah ganja planet ganja was
on way back machine as well, but only
[SPEAKER_06]: certain Threads were it was really hard to
find any consistency and why certain
[SPEAKER_06]: things were not.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not so See I wonder if I can still
bring in Caleb once I bring in West We've
[SPEAKER_06]: got a teaching how to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on request to join But how do I add
in people wasabi invite to join,
[SPEAKER_06]: okay That's all I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, what's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_06]: I exist No, you look like you're not dead
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely not dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good deal So Yeah, what's up with the
third party?
[SPEAKER_06]: Waiting for him wait for him for a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just talked to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be on Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I was just telling everyone we're
gonna be going over the forum era post
[SPEAKER_06]: overgrow so 2006 roughly and on and I was
explaining how there are a lot of a forum
[SPEAKER_06]: still up that were around during that time
like the farm I see mad Troll it up some
[SPEAKER_06]: of the some of the others that came around
that time But there are a lot that are not
[SPEAKER_06]: up and people that like to pretend that
they were around back then Often reference
[SPEAKER_06]: ones that are still up that they can go
back and like reread and pretend like hey
[SPEAKER_06]: I was I was there I know what's going on
but they're missing like 90% of the
[SPEAKER_06]: conversations that were going on because
those aren't even accessible any longer
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the one of the things I noticed
about that era is that You know a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: times we catch people on stuff Because
people go back to bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and they read You know threads and
things like that to pick up years and
[SPEAKER_02]: tidbits and information that like make
their their story sound better Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they weren't there to know Who was who
or like who to take seriously or what was
[SPEAKER_02]: misinformation even then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know and so a lot of times it's
a tell You know it is a big tell it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: big tell but to someone that never read
any of those forums You can come out and
[SPEAKER_02]: confidently start jabbing about a bunch of
stuff Yeah, and sound like you were there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah Not I'm not gonna say anybody's name
But someone made a post the other day that
[SPEAKER_06]: obviously was not around on the forum And
said you know X person got cloned from Y
[SPEAKER_06]: person got cloned from Z person and it was
just super off like the most off it could
[SPEAKER_02]: be I mean we I'm that's learning from me I
try we try not to name names when it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was pretty funny the chain of
custody Yeah, that was asserted You know
[SPEAKER_02]: you you just had you just had to laugh at
a certain point, but yeah, I will say even
[SPEAKER_02]: back then like You know I don't know
exactly know how to describe it But I
[SPEAKER_02]: would say that like like overgrow even had
some of the best commentary But also some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the worst Like you kind of the forums
really helped figuring out what you were
[SPEAKER_02]: doing if you already went in there with
some connection and some ability to
[SPEAKER_02]: discern Yeah, you know cannabis world was
a little bit more like where the adults
[SPEAKER_02]: gathered yeah over grow you could have
like everyone from Like some 17 year old
[SPEAKER_02]: kid shit posting you even though we didn't
use that term back then yeah to like
[SPEAKER_02]: Kamara and Sam skunk man and PhDs and
breeding talking shit in another in
[SPEAKER_06]: another area Yeah, so it really was like a
cross-section of weed in America my main
[SPEAKER_06]: my main thing would be like I would
compare that to like grass city from my
[SPEAKER_06]: era grass city and Roll it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: We always called it troll it up,
but those two were like what everybody
[SPEAKER_06]: would say like that's where everybody
everybody had an account on those pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: much because that's where everybody
started at during that era and then slowly
[SPEAKER_06]: you'd see people migrate but then those
the ones that hung out in that area kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of never really seemed to go anywhere as
far as their knowledge or Making any
[SPEAKER_06]: headway with anything really that's how I
saw it Yeah, I mean, and you know it
[SPEAKER_02]: should be said to that like you know there
was different different forums had
[SPEAKER_02]: different I Don't know different ethics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's the best way to put it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah You know some some were more lightly
moderated and things got left up You know
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously like hate speech and various
other aspects was was eliminated You know
[SPEAKER_02]: or but a lot of times you know unlike IG
or whatever You know if you didn't like
[SPEAKER_02]: the threads got left They might get locked
if arguments got too heated, but they
[SPEAKER_02]: would typically be left Yeah, we're in
today's environment on IG a lot of times
[SPEAKER_02]: people just get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah They'll just it's all it's all
what do you call that curated?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all curated as soon as it starts
going off the rails or as soon as they
[SPEAKER_02]: start seeing information They don't want
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they'll just delete comments or
they'll delete the whole thread or they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: turn off comments Yeah right away You know
and then you know I see mag you know there
[SPEAKER_02]: was you know there was an in crowd and an
out crowd mm-hmm You know definitely I was
[SPEAKER_06]: the out crowd I I think I had a record for
being the person most banned from Every
[SPEAKER_06]: forum and it I think that I mean I even
had my own forums back in the day that
[SPEAKER_06]: people rocked on You know it got bad I
mean it was interesting in the sense that
[SPEAKER_02]: like in the beginning in overgrown
cannabis world and stuff I was super
[SPEAKER_02]: excited, and I got on there to share
information with a bunch of people And
[SPEAKER_02]: then you know, but I was always nervous
about doing any kind like you know I lived
[SPEAKER_02]: in Mendo or whatever so I didn't really
need to like meet new weed people yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I liked Learning what other people far
away knew yeah, but a lot of people used
[SPEAKER_02]: it in the DMS to trade clones and do all
this type of stuff I never really did that
[SPEAKER_02]: I was more like an in-person kind of kind
of guy Yeah, and then when obviously when
[SPEAKER_02]: heaven's stairway got in trouble,
and they shut all that down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got scared so You know this era
that we're gonna talk about like 2006 on
[SPEAKER_02]: it really is CSI and Matt's era Yeah,
it really is where you know I might have
[SPEAKER_02]: been Lurking a little bit poking around
here and there And even some other friends
[SPEAKER_02]: of ours that aren't going to join like our
buddy high and lonesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Yeah, you know there was some people
that were they were extremely active in
[SPEAKER_02]: that air sure and know a lot of the Who
you know who is who is a jackass who was
[SPEAKER_02]: kind?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who was a problem back then you know where
stuff came from and?
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the interesting things about weed
is that it reinvents itself every five or
[SPEAKER_02]: ten years yeah So you get all these new
people coming in and people get to rebrand
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves Yeah, now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's happening every six months.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems yeah, well it's modern.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's turnover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah modern marketing I mentioned that I
mentioned this before, but it was kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like what the What the old deadheads told
me about how dead tour used to be before?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Grateful Dead had touch of gray a big
hit yeah, it was small Everybody knew kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of got vetted in you know things didn't
change that much and then You know oh my
[SPEAKER_02]: god big ups to Danimal Okay, so then and
then and then there was a top they had a
[SPEAKER_02]: top ten hit and literally hundreds of
thousands of new people showed up Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: and how do you assimilate them into your
community that fast?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can't really yeah, you know it
becomes difficult so a lot of times like
[SPEAKER_02]: old-timers or whatever they feel
overwhelmed Yeah, because like the norms
[SPEAKER_02]: of Their community and what they could
expect you know and instead of being like
[SPEAKER_02]: a respected elder Somebody's like who the
fuck is this guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, why do I have to listen to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know where before when it was
smaller like those people might have had
[SPEAKER_06]: respect Yeah, yeah, it's a much it did get
very different And I want to say it wasn't
[SPEAKER_06]: quite at cookies where everything took a
big swing But it wasn't much long after
[SPEAKER_06]: cookies came around that the forum the
whole idea of forms kind of changed But I
[SPEAKER_06]: think that also had to do with Instagram
Which is also why cookies kind of even got
[SPEAKER_06]: even more blown up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think social media Yeah, the kind of the
difference between the I would say the
[SPEAKER_02]: forums were mostly writing with some
pictures Where Instagram flipped it a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred and eighty degrees to being all
pictures with a little bit of writing
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so you see some of these old
write-ups that people have and their
[SPEAKER_02]: paragraphs, and you know they're like a
small essay yeah Right where people ask me
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff all the time on IG, and it's really
hard because it's like What are you gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: write a novel in the comments?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's kind of like you're trying to
write something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like this long like what can I
yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a haiku Yes, how can I get my my
thing across and like X amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: syllables or four sentences?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, you kind of have to especially
if you're on Twitter right and then and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you end up and then you end up
leaving on a lot of nuance in detail where
[SPEAKER_02]: on the forum era people could like write
three or four Paragraphs each back and
[SPEAKER_06]: forth and some like campy could write
really really just Bad really bad
[SPEAKER_06]: Unillegible stuff for paragraphs and
paragraphs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean when you write paragraphs you
really realize why we invented punctuation
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah for sure you know why we
invented paragraphs in the first place
[SPEAKER_02]: spacing periods commas all the various
aspects it really helps because Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what one of the things that hurt?
[SPEAKER_02]: You online is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nuance gets lost yeah does are you being
sarcastic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, being funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your body language?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know all those types of things You
know yeah, that was actually a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know in the overgrow era digital
cameras You know didn't exist yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I was talking I was actually
talking about that in the in the one that
[SPEAKER_02]: you missed because you were you know you
were otherwise Occupied where it was like
[SPEAKER_02]: people documenting their stuff really
advanced a lot more when digital cameras
[SPEAKER_02]: came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, and then exponentially once
Phones had cameras yeah once phones had
[SPEAKER_02]: cameras is all bets off the era where you
had to get your own stuff developed That's
[SPEAKER_02]: unsadly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not oh yeah, I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not very documented I mean I was it I
was at CSI's house I don't know happy year
[SPEAKER_02]: ago or something like that we were looking
through a couple of boxes of his Polaroids
[SPEAKER_02]: right yeah, but they fade Yeah,
that cat sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They fade You know and maybe if you would
have kept them in some kind of like a
[SPEAKER_02]: perfectly sealed environment with the
right humidity or something like that You
[SPEAKER_02]: know but yeah You're looking at Polaroids
from 95 or 6 or 7 or whatever and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: them the colors are bleeding into each
other And it's hard to make it's not It's
[SPEAKER_02]: not you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not shark.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah You know yeah That sucks that sucks
bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have never guessed that until he
told me that yeah I mean you know he's got
[SPEAKER_06]: a couple shoeboxes full yeah, and I have
busted his chops to get him fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: scanned I was like you got to get those
scanned at least for history.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like won't do any good I mean I I had
my my my first daughter in oh nine You
[SPEAKER_02]: know and I think and I can look back on my
phone I think you know the first real
[SPEAKER_02]: camera on an iPhone came out no wait oh
Now now I don't remember yeah late oh late
[SPEAKER_02]: oh wait You know and and that's kind of
that that was a revolution in itself Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure cuz yeah, you can just pull it
out of your pocket and be like there's my
[SPEAKER_06]: weed plant click It's always amazing that
with all these cell phones.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't really see many like real
documented UFO pics I know I'm it's kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of off-tangent, but I just thought about
that well I will say as a as a you know
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody who's pulled a lot of tarps in
their day Mm-hmm that you know a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: times when you pull tarp on you you're
doing light dab You're you're pulling tarp
[SPEAKER_02]: at six or seven o'clock at night,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and then you go back out there after
dark Which in June might be nine thirty or
[SPEAKER_02]: ten o'clock at night?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm right so pull the tarp off so
everything can breathe because you only
[SPEAKER_02]: want to darken it for as much as you need
to right oh yeah, and you don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: trap in all that moisture and all that
right so you got to go out there and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know Mendo or whatever in the woods and
Sometimes I would see the most beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: skies the most beautiful moons just yeah,
and Your phone could not show you what my
[SPEAKER_02]: eyes could see oh yeah for sure I would
take I would take you know pictures and
[SPEAKER_02]: You know and it would just never and I'd
go online and look.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I take better night photos?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it's just not a camera with like
a nice lens, and you know the ability to
[SPEAKER_02]: like You know it's just not it's just
meant to show dicks and tits That's all
[SPEAKER_02]: you're supposed to be taking pictures on
fellows ladies You know and and so you
[SPEAKER_02]: know there's there's an aspect to that
where it's like I can bet Like if you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't see like nobody can imagine how
beautiful this full moon is tonight Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can't capture that well How are
you gonna capture like I'm sure there's
[SPEAKER_02]: like this is that there's a weird thing in
the sky?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's yeah How are you possible?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know especially back in 08 or 09?
[SPEAKER_02]: How am I gonna pull out my two or two and
a half megapixel camera?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah on my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm gonna like capture it No,
you know it took a long time for Phones to
[SPEAKER_02]: even begin to catch up to like what 35
millimeter could do you're busting my
[SPEAKER_06]: skeptical comments not so You know
crushing my skepticism I fully believe
[SPEAKER_02]: that there are aliens I Just disbelieve
most people that tell them try to tell me
[SPEAKER_02]: a bunch of facts about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's not sure there are I just
don't know if they've ever been near Earth
[SPEAKER_02]: You know like I I have I that's where my
skepticism comes in when people Start
[SPEAKER_02]: writing getting like very long YouTube's
about all kinds of specifics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know yeah, I get weird Yeah,
yeah, I mean I'll say this you know and
[SPEAKER_02]: then Kayla and then he's officially
fucking late.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but You know when we were talking
about the the early the early 2000s or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever I you know I did that whole
episode when you weren't here Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hunting so hard for old stuff then
stuff from the 80s stuff from the 70s hell
[SPEAKER_02]: even stuff from some Of the 90s yeah,
and it was a royal bitch and nobody cared
[SPEAKER_02]: about it And I and I searched for years
and years and years and you know like we
[SPEAKER_02]: have a pretty good network of friends
Yeah, you know and it was really hard and
[SPEAKER_02]: now within the last five years as Ancient
stuff has become popular mm-hmm,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm not please don't take this the
wrong way if anybody's holding anything
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've never seen so much like 79
blueberry 72 you know Brotherhood of
[SPEAKER_02]: Eternal Love Acapulco gold you know 74
Wauhaken you know this that like all these
[SPEAKER_02]: 70s and 80s strain all the famous strains

[SPEAKER_06]: It's just blurry what he's got he's in
that fog you smudge your camera on purpose
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: we were just talking about The different
you know what was kind of going around
[SPEAKER_06]: post 2006 it was the end of the overgrow
era end of the cannabis world era and
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe maybe You could talk about some of
the things that you saw during those those
[SPEAKER_06]: That integral period between the end of
overgrow and the beginning of things like
[SPEAKER_06]: the farm What kind of what kind of strains
were people fucking with around then what
[SPEAKER_06]: was the hot shit Are you talking about
like oh six on oh?
[SPEAKER_06]: Six to like oh six to oh wait somewhere in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean I think that's
when chem dog really started becoming
[SPEAKER_03]: popular yeah, and Chem D came out I Think

[SPEAKER_03]: know mass G Posted up on IC mag although
that oh yeah that threat is gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh That's right gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did my research.

[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the creation of sour D1?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no that's oh that was the overgrow
that was okay, so yeah, that that's well
[SPEAKER_03]: long gone unless somebody has a archives
[SPEAKER_06]: So do you remember like around overgrow
what kind of the strains What kind of

[SPEAKER_03]: get some pollen off it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember us so much so much way you just
flower them out for like 80 or 90 days and
[SPEAKER_03]: get a couple bananas Yeah, I don't know
where you got that term from for it,
[SPEAKER_06]: but yeah, I remember yeah Yeah,
he's a special guy Actually, I did like is
[SPEAKER_02]: when his book came out or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like the Soma beds I don't own that
they were interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just they're just deep indoor beds
on wheels Yeah, you know it's basically
[SPEAKER_02]: what they were You know with with you know
some drainage in the bottom and some
[SPEAKER_02]: layering you know maybe they have some
rocks and they have some like and then
[SPEAKER_02]: they have a layer of ground cover or
something and then you put soil on top and
[SPEAKER_03]: and they have received Huh they had the
air tubes on them in all four corners
[SPEAKER_02]: where they're down to the lower roots You
would like big pieces of PVC with holes
[SPEAKER_02]: drilled in and you would put those on the
side And those would go all the way in the
[SPEAKER_02]: corners to the bottom Yeah, so that you
would actually and that would connect to
[SPEAKER_02]: the gravel at the bottom so that you bring
air Yeah, it wasn't the worst idea No,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done that really and especially for
well, it's not so much you had to go trees
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, you know look no look at
look at a bunch of you could you could
[SPEAKER_02]: actually grow a bed?
[SPEAKER_02]: With you know, homie style with 25 or 30
plants if you wanted Yeah, right,
[SPEAKER_02]: right, you know, and then you didn't have
to worry about individual ones dying
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right because you just watered the
bed and everything stays alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah I used to use those no drain beds
way back in 2000 or so didn't know dream
[SPEAKER_03]: beds just shallow like six ads,
you know How'd that work out?
[SPEAKER_03]: I?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, definitely some interesting stuff That
was back in my not so organic days I used
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to know this used to be pretty
funny where I used to know a lot Of guys
[SPEAKER_02]: in Mendo that were organic like April
through August And then come August
[SPEAKER_02]: they're like not or September.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not quite seeing their buds get as
big as they want And then they figure like
[SPEAKER_02]: well, what's one big tub of pink powder
gonna really do to my organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's basically organic Yeah,
yeah a couple a couple doses of this zero
[SPEAKER_02]: fifty thirty It's gonna get me where I
need to be and it's gonna make it happy
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've been organic for five Months
already, you know, so it'll all flush out
[SPEAKER_02]: at the end and it's definitely still
organic Yeah, that stuff was us Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: bud blaster three cheers for grow more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah But what was the cheap?
[SPEAKER_02]: But but blaster was the was the Canadian
heady version.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, it was Canadian.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was it was it was one of those,
you know powdered whatever It was all this
[SPEAKER_02]: it was all the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a bunch of people that came out
With zero fifty thirty and tried to make
[SPEAKER_02]: it seem like their zero fifty thirty was
special The one thing I'll say about the
[SPEAKER_02]: the bud blaster is that They had a they
had their own special grinder Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So their powder was super fine and it
actually dissolved Some of the cheap stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: you get there in like a thousand gallon
tank or whatever and you're up on a ladder
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're dumping stuff like that in
there and Then you get some softballs at
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottom that you're like wondering how
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, all right Yeah Right The various
characters the various things that were
[SPEAKER_02]: going on the stuff that was happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty much this is when these two
You know CSI used to be known as You know
[SPEAKER_02]: white trash redneck
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you know, but that but that's
where I mean You know Archive was doctor
[SPEAKER_02]: or the doctor Yeah, you know, it's where a
lot of the Monica a lot of the oldest
[SPEAKER_02]: nicknames and monikers People still kind
of reference each other like by some of
[SPEAKER_02]: those first names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm Don't know nobody's real name
Didn't need to ain't no purpose in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and I'm like IG you didn't you
never a lot of these people you never saw
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, my chick always asked me like what
what's his name?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I don't fucking know Ask him
that you know, that's just weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah She thinks I'm a freak for not
knowing anybody's first names after all
[SPEAKER_06]: these years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't fucking know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I Don't like it do his taxes for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck then you know that for It
was very it was very similar to that on
[SPEAKER_02]: like we on dead tour and stuff like that
because everybody you know Everybody had a
[SPEAKER_02]: nickname.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, you know everybody had a
nickname.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah But you know, I mean maybe maybe you
guys could talk about like, you know who
[SPEAKER_02]: Who were some of the big I don't want to
say the word influencer Maybe but who are
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the people that were sort of like
driving the conversations?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who are you excited to hear?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know posting on stuff like and then
maybe just like how hard it was to get
[SPEAKER_02]: information back there Because a lot of
these forums, you know, you guys were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about the chem dog You know,
there was an aspect where the reason why
[SPEAKER_02]: you know somebody like, you know skunk VA
has his name or chem dog 101 or any of
[SPEAKER_02]: these things is because I had some form or
another on IC mag or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first time these things started
getting argued about and debated Yeah by
[SPEAKER_02]: people outside and a lot of times What
happens to is that these things become
[SPEAKER_02]: references because then you've got this
guy comes out and says this thing on IC
[SPEAKER_02]: mag at this year And then three years
later on whatever on roll it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say he's saying this and now on IG.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said this and this You know And they
always they always want to be like this is
[SPEAKER_02]: the most current story.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what you should believe Yeah,
yeah, and in some cases those forms don't
[SPEAKER_02]: exist anymore and they're very fortunate
that they don't and you know, one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the ways that CSI got his
reputation as inspector is he was really
[SPEAKER_02]: good at using your own words against you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Well, I just but I just mean in the
sense of someone would like confidently
[SPEAKER_02]: say this this this this and this and then
he would be like well, why did you write
[SPEAKER_02]: in your own words that bastard this right?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you how do you make these two
things come together?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a bunch of swerve quotes I can
share You know and that's a lot of things
[SPEAKER_02]: most people probably don't even know who
swerve is but there's been there's been a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of people You know that come that,
you know flash in the pans that come and
[SPEAKER_02]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they come up They have their moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They they they spew a bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make a bunch of money All of a sudden
their stories start to implode Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and you know and in some cases they
rebrand themselves and sell it again do it
[SPEAKER_02]: to them to the new batch Right,
right, you know Who I looked up to is
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna be a lot different than maybe who
Caleb looked up to because when I first
[SPEAKER_06]: started Coming in it was way different
than when Caleb started coming in,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know So who like who were you looking
up to during those years or who who is?
[SPEAKER_06]: Who do you think was influencing really
well that that had some respect during
[SPEAKER_06]: those years?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I mean I liked you know Just just for
information, you know Alone, I liked Joe
[SPEAKER_03]: Brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked, you know chem dog mass G Yeah You
know skunk VA Yeah, and then on like the
[SPEAKER_03]: the og side of things, you know,
I was I always liked You know big Ricky.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was old family red back then I actually
a lot of people don't even know but I
[SPEAKER_03]: Named my old family purple my first TK
hybrid kind of after his old handle old
[SPEAKER_03]: family red, you know Oh, I didn't even
know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, I didn't action.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I gave him a lot of credit You know
chrome that was those were the years
[SPEAKER_03]: chrome was starting out with the white,
you know Yeah, he actually was growing
[SPEAKER_03]: some of my my hybrids And then he
introduced the white when he was growing
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah That's when that started.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I I think I was mostly into Bubba's
ogs and chem dogs back then yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: but uh What what were your your main main
interests though?
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I popped in, you know,
like Shanti Baba Was still pretty big and
[SPEAKER_06]: still had a good name a lot of the stuff I
was looking at when I came in was was
[SPEAKER_06]: Dutch stuff I really didn't focus a lot on
Americans at the time because it just
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't I wasn't hip to it, you know,
I hadn't right when I came in I wasn't hip
[SPEAKER_06]: to the fact that all those dudes were
white labeling and most the Americans are
[SPEAKER_06]: making their seeds or Spanish or actually
back then I don't even know who was making
[SPEAKER_06]: the motherfucker seeds, you know,
right but yeah, I mean It was very
[SPEAKER_06]: different.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean Greenhouse hadn't been totally
trashed It was still kind of under the
[SPEAKER_06]: radar for new people at the time that that
they were doing anything You know untoward
[SPEAKER_06]: DNA was massive during those years.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were wise Started doing six seeds a
pack because their shit was six seeds a
[SPEAKER_06]: pack and they were the ones selling the
most I was like, okay, I guess that's what
[SPEAKER_06]: you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and then sub cool, of course had
just started fucking taking off and I was
[SPEAKER_06]: fortunate that I met Sonny Chiba Very
early on so I learned very quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, maybe that guy isn't someone I should
be looking at for breeding tips,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know Right, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It took me a while, but I got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's it was it was a much
different take Yeah, it's interesting then
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's kind of when everybody
first came out of the shadows Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can walk out of the shadows with
any stories you wanted About yourself or
[SPEAKER_02]: the strains or whatever else and a lot of
times you were the only person You know
[SPEAKER_02]: from Sam's Cuckman on Yeah, you were the
only you were the only person telling the
[SPEAKER_02]: story about those strengths Right,
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean you remember, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: The audience was so small finding people
who are actually there, you know was was
[SPEAKER_06]: very difficult Yeah, it was it was a lot
smaller than now I just don't you think
[SPEAKER_06]: people that came later can grasp how small
the community was mm-hmm and how slow
[SPEAKER_02]: information was Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's pretty rapid fire Right,
you know and a lot of people connect all
[SPEAKER_02]: the time Oh, yeah, somebody said crunch
bubble, you know That guy I mean he that
[SPEAKER_02]: guy used to move massive amounts of what
was it blue dot?
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the third floor in Oakland,
you know, he had all those warehouses of
[SPEAKER_02]: 600 watt HPS is on hydro tables Bumping
out a bunch of stuff for third floor,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was you know What what's funny
about that guy is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those pictures were like some of
the first warehouse scenes that people
[SPEAKER_02]: were willing to like throw up on IG on on
the internet Yeah, most people were
[SPEAKER_02]: growing in closets or bedrooms or
greenhouses or in the woods or wherever
[SPEAKER_02]: and all of a sudden you see a 40 lighter
Right and for a lot of people that was the
[SPEAKER_02]: first time Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might look rudimentary now Yeah now but
yeah, but even just then and oh five or oh
[SPEAKER_02]: six or something like that You know
finding people and I think too that like
[SPEAKER_02]: what most people don't understand Maybe is
that a lot of the a lot of the breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: like that got famous later like a couple
people on The show or whatever like almost
[SPEAKER_02]: all the breeders were European or American
or Canadian?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right and the people that were
working Breeding in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're generally doing it through
friendship circles There was a lot there
[SPEAKER_02]: was a lot of trading and via DM amongst
friends and amongst contemporaries it
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't like like on you know, at least
from what I remember it wasn't like oh
[SPEAKER_02]: I've Got a big drop coming next Friday
Here's the fifth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the names.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made up for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the hybrids Here's where you can
get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's how we're gonna sell them all It
was like, you know You trade seeds when
[SPEAKER_02]: you saw people or people were trading
selling them via DM or something like that
[SPEAKER_06]: like but it it was different I remember as
far as Americans went there was not a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of Americans doing direct sales on
websites You would never really see that
[SPEAKER_06]: like it was all done, you know DMs or like
on weird little auction sites that were
[SPEAKER_06]: floating around but other than that there
wasn't a really good way to market
[SPEAKER_06]: yourself as an American breeder without
Mostly giving seeds away to people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, did you have that experience CSI?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I I didn't get involved in any of I wanted
to back in the 06 08 era.
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked into it but You know,
I was still way too paranoid to do any of
[SPEAKER_03]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I I could have done it, you know,
like You know DNA and sub cool and hell
[SPEAKER_03]: even swerve, you know, yeah You know,
uh, I mean all those guys, you know made
[SPEAKER_03]: huge names because there wasn't
competition Yeah, there's no competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't really have to have a whole lot
of talent to be very successful Someone
[SPEAKER_06]: just said mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soul handled all of SSC in the 80s Well,
I mean what's interesting about that is
[SPEAKER_02]: that You know, there's been a lot there's
been a lot of talk about American SSC,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and you know Matt and myself got to
interview the owner Who was very cool and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, all that kind of stuff got put
to rest Yeah hard that there wasn't there
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't any American help But that for
maneuver, but it goes but it goes to show
[SPEAKER_02]: how you know in our world You can kind of
step out of the shadows and be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, I mean there was a lot of people That
you know, they came out of the shadows and
[SPEAKER_02]: they were the first time that people were
like, you know Oh, I'm I this is my cut
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and then it turns out that they just
got the cut early Yeah, but they got a few
[SPEAKER_02]: years of like oh if you want to use my cut
You got to give me 50% of the proceeds of
[SPEAKER_02]: the seeds or you got to pay me or you got
a this or you got a That it's my work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my my my my and then it comes out
later that they just got it from these
[SPEAKER_02]: other people early But they were the first
one To go public Right, you know and a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of times what happened is is that the
first person to go public?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know got credit Yeah Yeah,
you know, you know, they got credit and
[SPEAKER_02]: their story was the story for a minute and
Sometimes other people would get upset and
[SPEAKER_02]: get online and start, you know,
I mean I actually think that's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: what got You know, you were talking about
chem.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of what got chem online was
You know skunk VA got online a bit you
[SPEAKER_02]: know and started talking about different
things and Then people were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh my weed's famous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should talk about it and then that got
and then that got that got Joe brand and
[SPEAKER_02]: and P bud and other people that hadn't
really met met up or like even linked or
[SPEAKER_02]: even realized what was going on after 15
years to connect right because of stories
[SPEAKER_03]: 707 seed bank Shaw bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the one who you know got skunk V A on
to overgrow and I see mag to actually post
[SPEAKER_03]: about that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I think there'd be a completely
different chem dog history Oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, if he hadn't done that, you know Do
we remember what the very very first claim
[SPEAKER_06]: of the chem dog seats?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily the first one people
remember but the very first claims of chem
[SPEAKER_06]: dog Who is the first one to claim that
string was it even Greg or were there
[SPEAKER_06]: other people popping up as it was getting
popular going?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've read that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember anybody claiming it Lots
of people claiming they had the 91 or oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's her It was just like well,
I don't know how all these different cuts
[SPEAKER_06]: could be the right one Oh, you know
because it's purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you know when it perps I I saw
a few chem dog cats and they they Some of
[SPEAKER_03]: them look like mass super skunk chem dogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah But that just basically means
somebody bought some weed that Was was
[SPEAKER_03]: called chem dog and it had some seeds in
it and whatever had pollinated that chem
[SPEAKER_03]: dog You know chem dogs not a bad
hermaphrodite just by itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean not so yeah, you know, no and So
usually if you find seeds in your chem
[SPEAKER_03]: dog, you know, it's been pollinated by
something else Yeah Well, there was there
[SPEAKER_02]: was also a thing too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was there was really confusing I
think and this isn't anything against Greg
[SPEAKER_02]: or chem dog, but you know, it's it's like
for people That want specific lineages He
[SPEAKER_02]: was pretty famous for you when you buy
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're buying chem dog weed from chem dog
It didn't really matter exactly what it
[SPEAKER_02]: was It was weed from chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that created confusion too
because everyone was like, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's this one specific thing You know But
it really was chem dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just branding.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean back then branding was branding You
know, it was it was it was early.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an early form of branding Yeah for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm, you know and people weren't and a
lot of these guys were young and nobody
[SPEAKER_02]: knew Especially then when things first
started getting famous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anybody knew that some of
these strains were gonna be so lastingly
[SPEAKER_02]: famous Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of times they wrote down Various
stories or this or that and they didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really expect it to get become part of
Canon or become part of the the fabric of
[SPEAKER_02]: the tail and Then they have to look back
and defend it You know And you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's hard for people sometimes to say,
you know, my memory was a little that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what I remembered at the time You know
after more after more information came out
[SPEAKER_02]: and I talked to more friends I've kind of
revised a little bit because other people
[SPEAKER_02]: had it's hard for people to say that a lot
of times you would dig in their heels
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and then you've got two or three or
four versions of the story and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to figure out which one works Which
one is the most believable?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, you know what what's your favorite?
[SPEAKER_06]: wildest story From the forum errors that
you knew I mean you that you knew was kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of like that's too fucking stupid to even
be possible Do you have any that stick out
[SPEAKER_06]: where you're like that was a bold fucking
claim and really won't wonky What comes to
[SPEAKER_03]: mind when I say that Okay, so I hate to
keep bringing up my boy swerve It doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: really have a whole lot to do with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the guy he got pretty much most all Of
his early og cuts from in 06 07 This guy
[SPEAKER_03]: Had an account on IC mag and then he made
up another account and I think this was in
[SPEAKER_03]: 07 and He made up another account
Pretending to be his own mentor,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know with all the same spelling errors
all the same, you know type styles all
[SPEAKER_03]: that and He made a whole thread on it and
acted like you know He was the original
[SPEAKER_03]: creator of the og kush blah blah blah and
his boy right here his little student You
[SPEAKER_03]: know, he's he's best student I ever had
We're of our boy and we hooked him up we
[SPEAKER_03]: laced him with all those those cuts we've
held since the 80s Yeah, that there's
[SPEAKER_03]: still that story on on a I see Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still like God, you know,
and I'm I'm a
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but that that one right there
was it was pretty much the tops for for me
[SPEAKER_03]: back in those days I got one for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got one for you Little old lady with
Asian fantasy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that was a really good one,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like was a good one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah Yeah, that one was was a there was a
strength called Asian fantasy made famous
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I think it's fair to say about the
camp Antiviral Jason King pretty much made
[SPEAKER_06]: that strain very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know known it wasn't a well-known
strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think was it No, no, no,
and you know, he he talked about the
[SPEAKER_06]: rarity and how this guy never lets it out
blah blah blah two years later a Person
[SPEAKER_06]: that we we cut we know who it was but I
don't think you'll ever admit it right
[SPEAKER_06]: went on and tried to say that she was the
the wife of the man who held Asian fantasy
[SPEAKER_06]: and He has died and she wants to get those
genetics out there, you know and ended up
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's pretty sure it was NYC kid
kind of big upping himself trying to give
[SPEAKER_06]: himself some provenance on a cut he never
had access to Well, we don't honestly we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know that part of it because Who
have you or anybody ever seen this Asian
[SPEAKER_03]: fantasy keyword fantasy outside of the
Canna Bible and NYC kid and his crew no,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's kind of a fancy Yeah,
and in fact African black magic I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's some there's some pictures of it
or whatever but I mean Jason King even
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about how homie wouldn't give it
out to anyone and You know was it was a
[SPEAKER_02]: massive hoarder of it, you know And so
there's an aspect to it there too where
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like people people can hoard
something so much that it doesn't become
[SPEAKER_02]: famous Yeah, right, you know because
nobody ever sees it like before before
[SPEAKER_02]: this forum time that you were talking
about there was probably like You know
[SPEAKER_02]: four or five people or something in
California that had the chem 91 And
[SPEAKER_06]: someone just said I have Asian fantasy s
ones from th gobs So we still doing it go
[SPEAKER_02]: NYC kid you go but yeah I think it was
like one of those things where like if you
[SPEAKER_02]: know if if og cush if some of it if some
of these famous things don't slip out and
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't start cropping them,
you know, there was an aspect where It was
[SPEAKER_02]: like for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was only four or five garages
pumping chem 91 Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so like every you know, so how much
weed is that not very much?
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't really give you very much
opportunity to try it doesn't really get
[SPEAKER_02]: give you an opportunity for like a fad You
know, like if og hadn't snuck out if all
[SPEAKER_02]: those guys hadn't been money hungry down
there in LA And it had snuck out it
[SPEAKER_02]: probably wouldn't have had that kind of
impact Yeah, because it has to be there
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be able to get that even even
if you have to pay a lot for it You do
[SPEAKER_02]: have to be able to access it Mm-hmm,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So Asian fantasy is one of those things
where like it, you know It never got out
[SPEAKER_02]: and then so as a result of that it allowed
scammers to be like this is it All right,
[SPEAKER_02]: and how could you tell the difference?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, um You know you still you still
buddies with the with old Jason.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. King Um, I haven't spoken to him in a
minute, but we're cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he lives on Maui I know I wonder if
you can ask him Kind of maybe some of it
[SPEAKER_03]: cuz I talked to him before I like met you
met you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah you know he he uh He affirmed that
you know, all my information was right and
[SPEAKER_03]: then he was like, where'd you where'd you
find all this stuff out?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean he might know some some
background details That you know
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely didn't make it into the book
about that One of the one I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: actually thinking about reaching out and
talking to him because one of the things
[SPEAKER_02]: that's interesting is that he probably has
a shit ton of pictures of weed from myself
[SPEAKER_02]: and my and some and friends and then
people that I don't know obviously too,
[SPEAKER_02]: but That didn't make it in the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because you know, you might take you
know dozens or hundreds of pictures or
[SPEAKER_02]: something and then to make it Yeah,
you pick a card You know and and all that
[SPEAKER_02]: but he You know, and I think I think the
Asian fantasy that he was talking about
[SPEAKER_06]: was in Hawaii It could have been I want to
say I remember and I could be totally
[SPEAKER_06]: wrong So maybe I shouldn't say it,
but I think I think Bodhi knows the Asian
[SPEAKER_06]: fantasy person.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I Might be wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm asking I mean to me it's one of the
it's it's one of those like Legendary
[SPEAKER_02]: strains, you know that like just never I
mean, you know, there's I'll mention
[SPEAKER_02]: another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of you guys have any any Experience
with Elvis Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but I don't know if it was I don't
know how real it was It was just a cut
[SPEAKER_02]: called Elvis because there's some really
famous stuff out there that just it was
[SPEAKER_02]: never in my crew Never in like the
extended circles of crews and you hear
[SPEAKER_02]: about him for a long time and it got
famous in various aspects but it's just
[SPEAKER_06]: like you know I also thought I had Albert
Walker too, though So there is that you
[SPEAKER_06]: know, like who knows who knows never got
it from a good source that they could say
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, this is where I got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: None of that shit and last one I had I
passed off to skunk master flex and I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't think you back to that and Your
Albert Walker was the orangey one,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, they go Walker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it'll day go Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um Did you ever see the mothership come
through I can't remember if you said Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I told this story before but like
it got mailed to one of our spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jason King's I don't think it's shade
to say this but his girlfriend at the time
[SPEAKER_02]: was this chick named Rebecca Yeah,
and she was from Asheville area of North
[SPEAKER_02]: Carolina And so she you know, he used to
rave about that cut all the time And so
[SPEAKER_02]: she finally got some of her friends to
send it to us Yeah, right and dude it was
[SPEAKER_02]: like our buddy high and lonesome has a
terrible story but It was kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: that in the sense where I was expecting to
get this tiny little box with some clones
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got this box that was like,
you know this big by two feet tall or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever and it was two mothership plants
in one gallon pots with steaks and each
[SPEAKER_02]: one was about 18 inches tall and Oh three
or something like that and it was like so
[SPEAKER_02]: all those people Pictures in the Canna
Bible that you see of mothership those all
[SPEAKER_02]: came from those two moms that got mailed
to us yeah, and then we mom those out and
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it got they got grown at Eddie
leps and they got grown to various friends
[SPEAKER_02]: houses and stuff like that So I actually
had I actually I had the mothership for
[SPEAKER_02]: four or five years, I think And it wasn't
I think it was a super unique plant It
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't one of I didn't have it didn't have
the nicest flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really like the flavor That much
but it had a pretty cool high and it did
[SPEAKER_02]: this weird thing where it would fall half
over but then hold itself up So like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know how most branches if they flop
they flop It would like flop but then it
[SPEAKER_02]: would like raise itself up and it would
grow sideways through your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm almost kind of a little like train
wreck it would get would catch itself and
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like and it had like these it was a
really odd sativa It had thin leaves and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was big branchy thing But you know,
I mean I honestly like compared to all the
[SPEAKER_02]: other shit We've been talking about like
Bubba's and chems and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: super scum.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was a little midsy You know in
all reality, but it was one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: things that probably like was genetically
very different than everything else So I
[SPEAKER_02]: like I like you know, we like those weird
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah real quick to tell
[SPEAKER_03]: I was on the outskirts of the Devil's
Harvest crew back in those days,
[SPEAKER_03]: too and There was there was some of those
guys that one Circulated through that crew
[SPEAKER_03]: a good bit and it it started I think you
rock from maybe like I don't know if I
[SPEAKER_03]: should say a stay and it's a long time on
You know I think he's he circulated Elvis
[SPEAKER_03]: for a while through there I wouldn't be
surprised if a doctor maybe had grown it
[SPEAKER_03]: He he was he was real good buddies with a
lot of those cats and I mean the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: time I was I was online I only I only
traded cuts through the mail maybe I only
[SPEAKER_03]: received cuts through the mail twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I like, you know 40 50 plus,
you know packages It cuts by only received
[SPEAKER_03]: twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did all my other business just in person
up and down the West Coast So that's me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very I'm in person Miss Elvis from the
farm Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't very good on the farm at all Very
very little it was a person who showed
[SPEAKER_06]: like they were the main person showing the
Elvis cut back then there was something
[SPEAKER_06]: called like the pink Cadillac cut and then
there was the Elvis cut That's that's the
[SPEAKER_06]: only person I ever got it from But I never
they disappeared like not even a month
[SPEAKER_06]: after giving it to me But they were the
ones that were always documenting it on
[SPEAKER_06]: the farm, but I never knew if that was if
it's just someone from that Bullshit and
[SPEAKER_06]: made their way through because they
disappeared so fast Was a super insensi
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was exactly like what they talk
about like a vinyl smell vinyl this
[SPEAKER_06]: artificial vinyl Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah one of the things that's kind of
interesting about that era too is it's
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like the last era before like the
the clone name dominance things started
[SPEAKER_02]: happening Where everyone's growing og or
everyone's growing sour or everyone's
[SPEAKER_02]: growing all that kind of stuff So there
was a lot of these odd strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, not odd in the sense that
there's anything wrong with them just odd
[SPEAKER_02]: odd random strains that were easily Sold,
you know, and so they they people liked
[SPEAKER_02]: them and they got traded Yeah,
you know people weren't looking
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily for like oh I need to get this
specific cut because I'm gonna be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: move it and it's gonna go for X price You
know, they were more interested in like
[SPEAKER_02]: the legend or the history or whatever of
said cut or the person behind it and you
[SPEAKER_02]: could get on there and start talking about
your cut and All of a sudden drum up a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of interest Yeah, and especially
like if we wanted to go back You know when
[SPEAKER_02]: we were talking about how small it was,
I mean think about how revolutionary,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know Just some some of Matt's favorite
some of blueberry stuff got you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and how it looked There wasn't that much
competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't that much stuff outside of
Europe or shanty or sensei or you know
[SPEAKER_02]: Simon from Sirius or some of that stuff
like there wasn't that many American
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders so the few people that were doing
it like like mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soul or or DJ short or whoever that Were
willing to to show their work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it kind of got like outsized You
know outsized impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm, you know, like since Cindy 99
probably got way more famous than it
[SPEAKER_02]: should have You know just to be just to be
just to be perfectly honest I don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: in today it would have the same lasting
impact Right now not today.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it wouldn't it wouldn't have it
wouldn't have been able to break through
[SPEAKER_06]: but it was like no I do think because it
is is like when you try to think of an
[SPEAKER_06]: outdoor plant That's fast enough and still
considered sativa to most people I think
[SPEAKER_06]: that it's it would be very hard to find a
replacement for c99 It's that fast with
[SPEAKER_06]: those type of high qualities and I think
that also had a major Effect because it
[SPEAKER_06]: was it's a perfect outdoor plant for blast
and fast, you know, it could be grown
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors I just mean it got like all his
work got real there wasn't that much
[SPEAKER_02]: competition So there was no a lot of time
to talk about You know, like not only
[SPEAKER_02]: Cindy 99 but like we're like the genius or
the Apollo this or that or whatever or
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know Everybody got plenty of
time to debate the four or five things
[SPEAKER_02]: that DJ released Yeah, because there just
wasn't that there wasn't that many
[SPEAKER_02]: different things You know, there wasn't
that many now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's there's thousands of breeders
Standing out is very hard then it was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, what was what was there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know a dozen big people doing
stuff Yeah, it was a lot easier for people
[SPEAKER_06]: to fucking keep other people down too Like
the ones at the top since it wasn't a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of competition and they held a lot of sway
They could really cut fucker's throats
[SPEAKER_06]: real fast and it happened a lot too And it
was a lot easier to do that, you know I
[SPEAKER_03]: would have probably got cut then and if I
had even tried to start back then did I
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, I was banned off every forum
and it got to the point where I was like
[SPEAKER_06]: fuck this I'm just start my own forum like
mr.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never got banned from I got asked to
leave after a pitch picture contest
[SPEAKER_06]: because the the right Barry pictures beat
out one of mr Nice's and he thought that
[SPEAKER_06]: was kind of fucked of me to put it in but
yeah, all the rest of them it was really
[SPEAKER_06]: hard because a lot of the ones a lot of
people that were running those forums also
[SPEAKER_06]: had a seed company and most of those seed
banks and seed companies would eventually
[SPEAKER_06]: start fucking people and if you were one
of those people to speak up You're done.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they don't want you around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I See mag definitely had some of
that aspect to it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there was the in crowd in the out
crowd, you know For sure as far as that
[SPEAKER_03]: goes I'm just out for him is still alive
after everything that went on with it Yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: See people somebody talked about that
people talk about 89 super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no 89 super skunk One of the
things that gets that that annoys the hell
[SPEAKER_02]: out of me honestly in this Isn't to call
out whoever has 89 super skunk but just in
[SPEAKER_02]: general is like they'll take the first
year That something was ever released or
[SPEAKER_02]: named and be like I have that weed from a
year or two before then Yeah, that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: big right like so the first time super
skunk ever got used was in the 1990 seed
[SPEAKER_02]: bank catalog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's when it had a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when it had a name That's when
Neville released it you know and so people
[SPEAKER_02]: Are like, oh, I've got the 89 super skunk
You know and then they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, you know Then they got to come up with
like well, you know It was all that
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-release special shit cuz I my uncle
was buddies with homie who gave it down on
[SPEAKER_02]: special kickdown Oh, they'll be like,
you know, you know, I got that 95 93 centi
[SPEAKER_06]: star I actually have pictures of that 1989
super skunk and they look awful cookie
[SPEAKER_06]: ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty pretty you know, it happens
all the time and then You see a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: these old cuts right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The years keep getting earlier and earlier
Yeah, you know, I mean one thing and this
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't you know, this isn't it,
you know, obviously Bodhi's use this or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever else right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is no g13 hash plant in the 88
catalogs No, no, it came out in the 89
[SPEAKER_02]: catalog for the first year 89 and 90 You
know, but 88 is much better it's Sounds
[SPEAKER_02]: nice, you know, and I'm not trying to
throw any shade on it or anything like
[SPEAKER_02]: that There's plenty of people that have
found nice weed and you know, buddy made a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of hybrids with it and it came from
NDN guy I think right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Originally or whatever, you know,
he reproduced it but it's like it got
[SPEAKER_02]: released in 89 Yeah, but everyone calls it
the great, you know the 88 Right close
[SPEAKER_02]: enough, you know, I'll those that you know
some of that first piff some of that first
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff They talk about they'll call it the
great 88 Yeah, that shit got released in
[SPEAKER_02]: 89 So there's a bunch of stuff out there
where people will be like this cut is from
[SPEAKER_02]: a year or two before this line ever got
released Here's a quick question though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean I have zero experience in this
because I was living in my you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: whole and humble but You were there so Or
maybe maybe you were there years later.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the possibility?
[SPEAKER_03]: of them doing releases of their seeds At
the canvas cups So that so that is true it
[SPEAKER_02]: is possible like for instance the first
cannabis cup I went to the was the Jack
[SPEAKER_02]: Herrera cup And the whole thing was themed
on him, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right and it was all about like it was the
whole like all the festivities were all
[SPEAKER_02]: about the Emperor wears no clothes and
they released Jack Herrera seeds You know
[SPEAKER_02]: from in 95 94 yeah 95 they released them
but they it was you know, it was late
[SPEAKER_02]: November Right, but it wasn't in the
catalog till the following year Right,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it was like literally it was literally
the first time for instance Jack was
[SPEAKER_02]: dropped was at the camp was at the
cannabis cup Right in late November.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I suppose you could have gotten it Jack
Herrera at least six weeks before the year
[SPEAKER_03]: turned Right, right, you know,
I mean For example, Salmon Creek Big Bud
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you know homeboy homeboy from
Salmon Creek, you know He bought those
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds at the cup the year it won the cup
and then smuggled 50 of those seeds home
[SPEAKER_03]: in his little belt, you know, hi hideaway
belt thing and That's you know his
[SPEAKER_03]: selection from those Sensi Big Bud seeds
or whatever is what made Salmon Creek Big
[SPEAKER_03]: Bud?
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that's that's definitely possible a
lot of times a lot of new seed releases
[SPEAKER_02]: would get dumped in late November then
Because because it was like an industry
[SPEAKER_02]: gathering right and there was tons of and
honestly there was tons of custies there I
[SPEAKER_02]: end up hating Going to Amsterdam for the
cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went three times and then never again
Mostly because it sucked And the reason it
[SPEAKER_02]: sucked was that Amsterdam is pretty far
north and So it's cold as shit in late
[SPEAKER_02]: November there, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can go in summer and it's nice and
it's beautiful and you're on a bicycle and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're cruising around all stoned or you
can go when it's sleeting and 29 degrees
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not as nice You know and then
all the best weed would get saved for
[SPEAKER_02]: celebrities that were coming in And who's
who so there was worse weed to get because
[SPEAKER_02]: it was all getting saved for you know
Snoop Dogg or you know Sam Scuckman's
[SPEAKER_02]: friends or you know, whoever whoever the
high times crew or whatnot and then on top
[SPEAKER_02]: of that You could buy tickets to go to the
cannabis cup out of high times Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you go to Europe on vacation and the
coffee shops are full With all these dudes
[SPEAKER_02]: from Jersey and New York Yeah screaming
about wanting to get the best bud in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world So it's like you fly 12 hours away
from your house and you're surrounded by a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of obnoxious East coasters and
There's not as good weed and it's crowded
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's cold and it's raining or it's
snowing and it's like I much preferred
[SPEAKER_02]: going there in summer You know just
because it was nice and chill You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was like an event that was like the
it was it wasn't an event then you know
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know, really like the story goes,
you know Neville didn't even want to
[SPEAKER_02]: release Jack Herrera that year He didn't
think it he didn't think he didn't think
[SPEAKER_02]: it was done But they wanted something new
and hot that they could call Jack Herrera
[SPEAKER_02]: And isn't the story of fucking Cindy 99
that it fucking dude bought Jack Herrera
[SPEAKER_02]: in a coffee shop and found seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep And then took him home and started his
whole cubing fucking princess Whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: thing that he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Rick did anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying that's the story Yeah,
you know, he found bag seed in a in buds
[SPEAKER_02]: that he bought at a coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep Mm-hmm, you know or be 99 and genius
or are both the Jack Herrera at best
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids Yeah, and really like and You
know, I think back then that was even
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier like we weren't using the improper
term back cross yet or you know BX Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were talking about fucking wasn't it
cubing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was it was he was cubing you were
cubing it you were like fucking and they
[SPEAKER_02]: had all those like long-winded posts on on
Fucking the forums about what percentage
[SPEAKER_02]: and how much it was increasing with every
one you did and laying it all out You
[SPEAKER_02]: know, yeah There was some really bad
breeder tech being shared that seemed
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting-edge at the time Mm-hmm,
you know still repeat that fucking shit
[SPEAKER_06]: like like Mantra.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're gonna back cross it four times
and you get that's as good as an s1 That's
[SPEAKER_02]: a clone and I saw and I saw somebody
talking about I like the super silver haze
[SPEAKER_02]: better than the Jack Herrera the whole
reason super state silver haze exists is
[SPEAKER_02]: because Neville didn't feel like the Jack
Herrera project was Ready for primetime.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just released it due to you know,
Alan and Ben drunkers from Sensei were
[SPEAKER_02]: businessmen And so when he left he kept
working on it Mm-hmm, and then a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: years later, I think in 97 or something He
wrote they released mango and Neville and
[SPEAKER_02]: super silver haze Because he felt like you
know, they'd actually gotten somewhere
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right, right, but they still did a
couple and I actually think that was the
[SPEAKER_02]: last big release the Neville ever did
right But I mean I smoked that that super
[SPEAKER_02]: silver haze cut because to I went in 90 I
was basically like every other year like I
[SPEAKER_02]: went 97 and 99 to the cups And those last
two cups that super silver haze was all
[SPEAKER_02]: over the place Because that way that was
in that was like the first and third year
[SPEAKER_02]: at one It was like the hot shit over there
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really was it was the hot shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it was super there was a phenol of
it That went like 14 weeks Will the
[SPEAKER_02]: community let rez back into play?
[SPEAKER_02]: Rez is doing his own thing, you know What
most people don't know about rez and our
[SPEAKER_02]: are a couple of buddies remind reminded me
of not that long ago was like Before all
[SPEAKER_02]: the bullshit with the with the law
enforcement and all that He was a dick
[SPEAKER_02]: online anyway Right big time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a big-time troll jerk Generally a
pain in the ass to get along with not a
[SPEAKER_02]: pleasant homie Yeah, despite despite any
of the rest of the bull whatever you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to believe about You know all the mess
that happened legally or whatever Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: he was a he was an early troll Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a jackass.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a huge ego Yeah, I mean he still
does He had a decent level of intelligence
[SPEAKER_03]: which would have been I think much more
appreciated If we hadn't had so much ego
[SPEAKER_02]: with it Yeah, a little middle,
you know, I mean not you know a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: ego and a bunch of rudeness Mm-hmm,
you know, there was some rude there was
[SPEAKER_02]: some rude people you could put up with a
little bit better But they were like
[SPEAKER_02]: borderline geniuses Right, right,
right, you know, like Tom Hill could be a
[SPEAKER_02]: real dick if you asked a dumb question You
know or Sam skunk man he could be a dick
[SPEAKER_02]: too because You know you get tired of I've
told the same story five billion times,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna question me You're 23.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a cocksucker, you know,
yeah eat my dick, you know, basically You
[SPEAKER_02]: know rude rude kind of rude, you know,
but it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to have patience You know and
let's face it right a lot of us are
[SPEAKER_02]: weirdos a lot of us don't have the
greatest interpersonal skills to begin
[SPEAKER_02]: with I mean speaking for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably have a little bit more than
your average grower Yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a lot but a lot of them it's like,
you know We're kind of harsh edges people
[SPEAKER_02]: that live in the hills Don't talk to
people hang out with plants and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: really good with plants and they're not so
good with social interaction So you put
[SPEAKER_02]: those people on the forums and you put
those people like, you know on IG Or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever and it's like it's not the
easiest thing I did have an adjustment
[SPEAKER_06]: period that I will admit I had an
adjustment period of where I May have been
[SPEAKER_06]: a little meaner in responses and talking
to people little snappy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a little bit of ego You know it
happens, but some of us grow into
[SPEAKER_06]: beautiful smiling faces like this I'm also
still banned from Breed Bay for picking on
[SPEAKER_02]: sub cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also it's also the The way I look at
it is like, you know, I mean everybody has
[SPEAKER_02]: the natural inclination sometimes But it's
like are you trying to get your point
[SPEAKER_02]: across you trying to fucking argue on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, here's this dude who says his dad
created dog, but I remember that guy He's
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to dox me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm gonna balk him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, there you go I mean the thing the
thing about the one thing we'll say about
[SPEAKER_02]: dog, but and then we'll move on is that
Joe brand and Peabody we're buying and
[SPEAKER_02]: selling weed on dead tour all the time for
cash to go see dead shows, right then this
[SPEAKER_02]: one weekend they sold some weed and then
they mailed Greg some more weed and Then
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 years went by before they even heard
anything cool came out of it Mm-hmm Right,
[SPEAKER_02]: they literally they never saw chem 91 or
anything like that until oh six until the
[SPEAKER_02]: reunion When the forums got people back
together, they had no idea They're on dead
[SPEAKER_02]: tour, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They met This you know, you know these got
Greg was in it was a teenager from the
[SPEAKER_02]: East Coast and they sold him some weed in
Indiana Right, which was just one stop on
[SPEAKER_02]: summer tour and you're buying pounds and
you're selling eighths and quarters and
[SPEAKER_02]: halves and ounces and it ran out and you
buy some other pounds and you just keep
[SPEAKER_02]: doing that and you did that for a while
and One of these sales turned into
[SPEAKER_04]: something Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you want to hey 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was summer On dead tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember this one couple pounds you
had that you were hustling for like a
[SPEAKER_02]: weekend?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any clear memory of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's kind of important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think I think you might have
remembered just because he Hit Joe brand
[SPEAKER_03]: up, you know G hit hit Joe brand up again
and had him mail him some more weed I
[SPEAKER_02]: think who else right who ounces and we
don't even know If the seeds came from the
[SPEAKER_02]: deer Creek show or the seeds came from the
weed that Joe sent him later It's I from
[SPEAKER_03]: based on the stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've kind of Deciphered I think it it came
from the ones that was sent that one had
[SPEAKER_03]: no seeds But then again, we know G's
stories are a little up and down I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know not to I like two of my favorite
cuts of all time come out of G's little
[SPEAKER_02]: rooms, but I will say that All of us on
this thing have tried to Have tried to
[SPEAKER_02]: interpret what he meant by rejuvenating
the 91 after it got tired in night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Rejuvenate yeah, the rejuvenation he
had to let it go and rejuvenate it From
[SPEAKER_02]: seed and that shit never got explained You
know And so I don't you know, there's when
[SPEAKER_02]: it when any time you have a situation
where you know, we can even go back and
[SPEAKER_02]: take you know, like ancient, you know,
ancient Virginia's skunk bud grown for SSC
[SPEAKER_02]: or Mr. Soul, you know working for SSC,
you know, you you create these ancient
[SPEAKER_02]: legends and it's like how do you disprove
them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah in a lot of cases you can't prove or
disprove because they're so old Well,
[SPEAKER_06]: let's get back to the forums.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah What was the first place?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember where the first like seed
bank the first seed bank that carried your
[SPEAKER_06]: shit when people could actually buy it
which One was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we don't talk about that
Unmentionable I ain't friends with that
[SPEAKER_03]: guy anymore Dude a little loco.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha You gotta remember I didn't even
Start my seed company until 2014.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I I mean I could say one thing is
this My buddy that I never mentioned his
[SPEAKER_02]: name but Staten Island when we were doing
all the superdog work And we were doing
[SPEAKER_02]: all those hybrids that made it into the
Canna Bible.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had big dreams of Realizing that you
could probably make more money like off of
[SPEAKER_02]: an eight lighter of seed then you could
off an eight lighter of flower and He saw
[SPEAKER_02]: what was coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly didn't believe him You know,
I didn't think I didn't think that we you
[SPEAKER_02]: would ever be able in America to like
package up and sell enormous amounts of
[SPEAKER_02]: seed or anything like that because at the
time we were making all this stuff and we
[SPEAKER_02]: were literally giving it away to good
friends and stuff because We had more than
[SPEAKER_02]: we knew what to do with and there wasn't
an outlet for it You know the era that
[SPEAKER_02]: that Caleb talks about getting involved is
one of the earlier eras where you could
[SPEAKER_02]: really Actually start to sell it It wasn't
simple in the beginning even even if you
[SPEAKER_02]: were an active breeder finding Out how to
get it to the community wasn't very
[SPEAKER_02]: simple.
[SPEAKER_06]: No You had to trust I mean like even even
with me I started the Selling seeds
[SPEAKER_06]: directly really early for for a US person
but when I first started you still had to
[SPEAKER_06]: Really put your trust in someone in Europe
for the most part if you wanted any kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of traction for your seeds if you wanted
any I mean you had to work with seed banks
[SPEAKER_06]: for people they Eventually know who you
are the seed bank didn't care you you
[SPEAKER_02]: probably wanted We were about to go into
CSI after dark Yeah, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know a good bit of that was in
the 90s You know when DJ short wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: get his blueberry seed out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had to give it away to Two different
groups in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah first.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had to give it to Tony at SAG Martha
and then he had to give it to Dutch
[SPEAKER_06]: Passion I don't know if he intentionally
gave it away, but I think that's how it
[SPEAKER_06]: ended up working out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't didn't he Purposely give them to
him and make he purposely did I think he
[SPEAKER_02]: thought that he would still retain all
Control and this and that that's where he
[SPEAKER_02]: was probably mistaken But in order for him
to even like get money for his seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had to send them to an established seed
bank Yeah in a different continent That's
[SPEAKER_02]: how hard it was to move seeds then Yeah,
but you know when he I think SAG Martha
[SPEAKER_02]: they had his seeds and what like you know
the mid 90s or something like that Right
[SPEAKER_02]: around there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah internet didn't even exist then
really Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did but not not any level that you were
gonna be able to use it for that Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, I think overgrowth started in either
98 or 99 Yeah, yeah now you're right about
[SPEAKER_02]: that so like the first forums the first
being able to exchange stuff like how
[SPEAKER_02]: would DJ have even set up and Internet was
gonna set up a Geo cities like fucking you
[SPEAKER_02]: know webpage and sell illegal beans You
know I mean up until up until they passed
[SPEAKER_02]: the the 215 and in late 96 I think it was
it was it was illegal in all 50 states
[SPEAKER_02]: there was Any there wasn't even a
legitimate reason you could possess any of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah And I think he feels burnt.
[SPEAKER_02]: He felt burned, but you know, what were
you gonna do when you gave it away to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Dutch?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right if he didn't know that those those
Dutch guys were gonna do whatever the fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: they wanted with it Then he was just he
had just done his groundwork.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Well, yeah, that's a Blueberry is
almost a Full day's topic just by itself
[SPEAKER_02]: it is But I just meant in the sense that
like just to use it on the example of how
[SPEAKER_02]: hard it was to sell seeds If you were a
small American breeder, yeah, he had to
[SPEAKER_02]: work with the Dutch just to get it out
there There wasn't an avenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were you gonna do?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know You know even like early
even early American You know seed sellers
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever used to try to fake that their
stuff was based out of Europe Right,
[SPEAKER_02]: right Right You know, I I mean one of the
things that IG Did and and the middle and
[SPEAKER_02]: and the sort of the middle era of two
middle late 215 was things opened up
[SPEAKER_02]: enough that people felt free To be able to
like, you know, you could have a swamp
[SPEAKER_02]: boys You could have a CSI humble you could
have a you could have just these people
[SPEAKER_02]: that were like I'm gonna make my own
packaging I'm gonna make my own beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna go to these like gray area
cannabis cup swap meats and Hustle seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna start to mail I can say back in
oh 2030 405 I mean my buddy from Staten
[SPEAKER_02]: Island would tell me about this stuff that
he wanted to do and I would laugh I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, oh you want us to all go to jail?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's what you that's what it
seems like you're talking about to me,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know Yeah when I started I I was one
of the Pete I think I was one of the few
[SPEAKER_06]: people that pretended that my website was
in Amsterdam just to like Try to hide
[SPEAKER_06]: under the shadows, you know, just cuz no
one was doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It fucking was a big Red flag,
so even yeah, I mean it's waiting for that
[SPEAKER_02]: hit even having the infrastructure set up
to be successful Yeah, and and that's kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of why there was so few breeders back then
Because it was generally done out of love
[SPEAKER_02]: and You were trading amongst other people
and there wasn't something like there is
[SPEAKER_02]: now where somebody can be like,
oh I'm gonna drop my Mac one drop and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna make 200 grand and it you know I'm
gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna hype it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: you really couldn't hype it There wasn't
marketing there wasn't an ability to reach
[SPEAKER_02]: a big audience Right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think You know, no, it took a
while Well in in in the era, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh six, you know through oh eight even
2010 I mean most of the marketing most
[SPEAKER_03]: most of the availability was all based on
internet forums, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know that was yeah and people
should also remember that when Overgrown
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis world got shut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got shut down because a very big,
you know seed vendor got raided heaven
[SPEAKER_02]: stairway I Was and that scared a bunch of
people And there's still repercussions and
[SPEAKER_02]: ripples hitting from that fucking bust,
you know and You know and then you know
[SPEAKER_02]: and and you know and people even in Canada
and stuff like that You know Mark Emory,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I mean he he went to fucking He
went to jail Did you have any dealings
[SPEAKER_03]: with Mark Emory Caleb at all, oh no,
no interactions no interactions at all,
[SPEAKER_03]: but uh You know, I was getting Cannabis
culture or cannabis Canada from pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: much like the first issue, you know,
I've always been a historian So I mean I
[SPEAKER_03]: have hundreds and hundreds of can of books
and I was you know for years I was getting
[SPEAKER_03]: every single magazine that was put out on
on everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've always been way more of a reader
than a talker Yeah, you know it helps put
[SPEAKER_03]: details together sometimes Yeah,
it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah But no no no direct, you know
dealings.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean the stuff I liked from from those
magazines though and and him were like the
[SPEAKER_03]: ABC stuff from back in late 90s and then
the purple indica purple Kush stuff That
[SPEAKER_03]: was in those early issues as well But uh,
and then Emory was working with the same
[SPEAKER_03]: purple indica that's around now or at
least a relative It wasn't Emory.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an article based out of
Snohomish County in Washington and It
[SPEAKER_03]: basically dated that that stuff back into
the you know at the very least,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know early mid 90s, you know,
so There was a question we were talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about the other day And I was like I need
to ask not so that and I can't remember
[SPEAKER_06]: what it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: It had something to do with How did Kim do
you make it to California not so oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, how did it make it here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, who brought it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's pretty simple story.
[SPEAKER_02]: So It ties into the forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: So People start in 06 people started
getting excited about a chem dog and the
[SPEAKER_02]: chem dog story because it started getting
posted like Caleb was saying shot our
[SPEAKER_02]: shabba got Got skunk V8 to start posting
about his, you know recollections and
[SPEAKER_02]: different stuff like that and and Then you
know, that's kind of actually what started
[SPEAKER_02]: to reunite People like P bud and Joe Brand
and Chem dog all they all started chatting
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe they even called like the the
seeds that ended up Being the one through
[SPEAKER_03]: four the reunion seeds or yeah the number
four they Named the reunion fino specific
[SPEAKER_02]: a reunion fino That's what it was right
because it was like they'd all they'd all
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of met up as this You know like
different people were like hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, they're talking about your story on
the internet, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: and so Chem dog hadn't actually had the
chem 91 in quite a long time He had gotten
[SPEAKER_02]: in trouble and lost it and he had been
working with some of the Chem dog super
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk hybrids that he had and bag seed and
different things and when it got famous
[SPEAKER_02]: again He wanted it back, but nobody had it
so he got He got skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got skunk VA to go back East with it
and he was like if you bring it back to
[SPEAKER_02]: bring it back to me and I've got this
different one that you guys don't have out
[SPEAKER_02]: there and I'll give it to you so he went
back East and and saw a dude and Gave him
[SPEAKER_02]: the and gave him the dog and then Greg
gave him the D And he came back and mom
[SPEAKER_02]: did up and that's how me and I see
collective both guy So is it skunk the a
[SPEAKER_02]: that did it right?
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% Oh cool, and that was it It was him
it was it was all it's he's the reason
[SPEAKER_02]: it's he to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the reason it's on the west coast He
put forth the effort he went back East to
[SPEAKER_02]: see chem dog He gave he gave the dog to
chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got the D If I remember to I believe
that Chem dog tried to give him back the
[SPEAKER_02]: MSS Yeah, he just said that but it was the
shorter one that was in the high times and
[SPEAKER_02]: it wasn't what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Homie remembered it all that makes a lot
of sense, too Yeah, so then yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: so then he came back and he grew it up
into a mom or whatever and then I see
[SPEAKER_02]: collective and myself got it not that long
after that and but to me it's like the
[SPEAKER_03]: reason it's on the west coast is is Skunk
BA Well on Greg on G's tour He he dropped
[SPEAKER_03]: it off in the you know, LA area with
swerve the chem D in 06 but this is off of
[SPEAKER_03]: 06 he and Swerve traded him a bunch of
fake cuts for it, you know a big deal and
[SPEAKER_03]: then He stopped at he stopped at You know
obsolete's in Central Cal On his tour and
[SPEAKER_03]: then he stopped at Joe Brand's and then he
headed up into Oregon and stopped at some
[SPEAKER_03]: other folks place and I think he might
have given them the chem D too,
[SPEAKER_03]: but he he stopped at a good handful of
places giving cuts out selling weed at
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries all that kind of stuff on his
You know reunion tour of sorts and this is
[SPEAKER_03]: like first week of August 06 so it sounds
like Skunk VA went over there,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know earlier in the year and and and
got The same or similar cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know Seems like there was a few
cuts that got passed out that year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, I mean it so but that's that's
kind of that's how that's how that the and
[SPEAKER_02]: that led to a bunch of stuff that led to
the 1 2 3 4 Getting popped and started to
[SPEAKER_02]: get traded around That led to the D that
led to the 1 through the 4 and the D and
[SPEAKER_02]: all that starting to get added to the mix
I don't know that the weird thing about
[SPEAKER_02]: the the chem stuff is that my buddy
Disliked the cysts quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He thought it was ugly and he didn't like
how it got him high So he never brought it
[SPEAKER_02]: west And so it never really percolated
around our crew You know we Way later.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw some of the s ones But not the
actual not the actual first one,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, yeah so But yeah, I mean that's
and I you know, I'm pretty sure You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: he I never lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never lost it after skunk gave it to me
Yeah, I mean that and that's that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of thing like, you know CSI and I
talk about it all the time It's like are
[SPEAKER_02]: there strains where like the chain of
custody wasn't broken
[SPEAKER_02]: Because once you lose the chain of custody
You know, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets hard, you know, like Because who
knows, you know, you try to you lost the
[SPEAKER_02]: sour diesel you try to get it back It's
not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember you lost this you try to get
it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the same you remember You know so
on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Kind of like when a 707 Shabbat got his
bubba back from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I I don't think I did it on purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got mixed up in a flat what cuz I was
bringing a ton of people a bunch of stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: at a party and Then like a year later.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, yeah inspectors bubba and I was
like, what's this inspectors bubba and he
[SPEAKER_03]: had bomb threat not
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to give you you know, the fake
that's one well not fake but you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, but yeah that happens all the time I
Think I'd take a bomb threat over over
[SPEAKER_03]: original maybe you can always get a new
bomb threat if you have that That's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good point, you know question for
you since uh, we've kind of meandered away
[SPEAKER_06]: from the forum stuff, but do you See a
side.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you do any work with Jesus?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you planning any work with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if I could find a mass super skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah those for you to really I was telling
him last night that I think he should
[SPEAKER_06]: because I think it's a it's a rad clone
But it is it is very finicky and it does
[SPEAKER_06]: make it a lot harder to pull off reversals
on unhappy finicky shit right,
[SPEAKER_03]: it would it would be really cool kind of
Attempt to remake like a sour type from
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, you know building blocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, you know, we all have the
the 91 But you know what building blocks,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it might not have to be the
exact thing But what could you get close
[SPEAKER_03]: enough to?
[SPEAKER_03]: To make a sour diesel out of you know,
the original building blocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know, I Think diesel leans
closer to a sour type than it does a chem
[SPEAKER_06]: type personally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm No, yeah, definitely definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a cool one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So people want to hear something about
Irene.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what they want to hear about
Irene I think we've already told the story
[SPEAKER_06]: of Irene, but do you have any good Irene
tales?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean She's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I I had Irene for a little bit and
didn't realize she was she was you know as
[SPEAKER_03]: as nice as she was until I think I grew
her outdoors in maybe 2008 I'm thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I Don't want to fudge the fudge the
dates though But yes, she came out so nice
[SPEAKER_03]: back then You know Good old-fashioned
Atlanta Atlanta's finest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is a special one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I mean, it doesn't have a whole whole
lot of a story, you know Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: just another bag seat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it goes boys down to is just
another fucking bag seat The most humbling
[SPEAKER_02]: things about reading is That a lot of the
most famous strains are total accidents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm Right, and you put a bunch of time
and work and effort into stuff and then
[SPEAKER_02]: you know Your air conditioner goes out and
some shit herms and the seat off of that
[SPEAKER_02]: is better than anything you tried to do
and a lot of times when it comes to like
[SPEAKER_02]: these stories The week the accidental weed
is so good It's what makes people want to
[SPEAKER_02]: try to like shoehorn in that they had some
intentional part of making it Not so much
[SPEAKER_02]: that I was just there or we got late.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to say well, I just got
lucky in my room Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to be like, oh well I did this
and I did this and I did this and then
[SPEAKER_02]: that happened and yet now it's all the
weed that you all want Well, everybody's
[SPEAKER_06]: got to work their stud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that how it's done, you know,
but but really it was more like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know I was I had my room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up partying for a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucked off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I walked in there There was some bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found some seeds trimming That's like
99% of bag seed stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that that's kind of why I believe
Matt burger and Josh D story because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: not impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a It's a herm, you know in a
little closet under the stairs story and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just like who makes that stuff Yeah,
you know I That's very humbling but I also
[SPEAKER_02]: do think that a lot of that 90s weed It
just goes to show that when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: crossing things that like aren't when
you're crossing real fire You know,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot easier to get you know,
like was was never An amazing breeder or
[SPEAKER_02]: do you just get to get the best of the
best from America and cross it together
[SPEAKER_02]: for the first time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm saying there's an there's an
app.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's arguments to both He was you know,
he was the first person to cross and Ellen
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk Right, you know I was thinking you
should get Tom on and try to get figure
[SPEAKER_03]: out a little more detail About pine tar
and all that kind of stuff cuz love to You
[SPEAKER_03]: know, I don't think he even knows who I am
to get him on or he's not likely III think
[SPEAKER_03]: he's banned off IC mag.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean, let me ask you like a
real question Do you think that he would
[SPEAKER_02]: be better for a live or do you think you
would be better for us a lightly edited?
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast or something Oh probably a Heavily
edited podcast, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean we definitely Matt and I have
definitely interviewed some like
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledgeable old-timers, right and like
Yeah, no homes the character I like him
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah Topic yeah, you know,
so there's there is a question Everybody
[SPEAKER_06]: is asking and it's up to you if you want
to talk about I don't even know if you
[SPEAKER_06]: want to deal with this one right now or
save it for a Full episode Caleb.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm Backstory on Z.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Man, um, I don't want to like Say say
yet because yeah, let's say you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: save it for a full show some sort later
Well, I still have some groans to do on
[SPEAKER_03]: that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, man, I Wouldn't be surprised if
it's not just an s1 of That green sherbert
[SPEAKER_03]: cut yeah, there's there's just two too
many similarities and The whole you know a
[SPEAKER_03]: heterozygous homozygous thing between the
two of them Really kind of leans towards
[SPEAKER_03]: it just being a s1 of that Yeah,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um Yeah, I could go on and on on some
comparisons on you know how some of that
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff could a could potentially Make
sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know Yeah, we'll save it for
another time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's a good answer one thing
one thing that is going about that is that
[SPEAKER_02]: CSI and I and Matt we all talk all the
time about how when you compare stories to
[SPEAKER_02]: what the plants tell you How they breed
what their s1s look like what what they
[SPEAKER_02]: look like when they get crossed to
different things and how what your Eyes
[SPEAKER_02]: tell you lines up with what the story is
Right, right, you know and sometimes it
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes it adds a lot in terms of what
you see You know like about I have a hard
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a really hard time believing That
the the the sis the 91 you can D and the
[SPEAKER_02]: one through four all came out of the same
bud Yeah, yeah, you know, they're just too
[SPEAKER_02]: vastly different to me You know,
but that's I wasn't there either,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know And a lot of this stuff is like
the most famous stories They all almost
[SPEAKER_02]: because almost all of them come from
accidents and because a lot of them come
[SPEAKER_02]: from other people It's like the people
that marketed stuff or marketed skittles
[SPEAKER_02]: or marketed cookie or whatever Like they
probably you know different people get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it doesn't get quite as famous You
know, um, you know and they should get
[SPEAKER_02]: great credit for marketing it to the point
that they did Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah I've never disputed that You
know, I I give lots of people accolades
[SPEAKER_03]: for mark successfully marketing and You
know building, you know clones that would
[SPEAKER_03]: never have been anything up, you know to
what they are What I've always you know
[SPEAKER_03]: frowning of course is you know people
being dishonest doing it I think you can
[SPEAKER_03]: do it honestly and still be successful
Sure, you know having to just make up big
[SPEAKER_03]: old Big old, you know fictitious
backstories or act like you're the one
[SPEAKER_03]: responsible for it That's why instead of
you know, I mean there's cats like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, Josh and Matt are like,
oh, yeah It was a harm accident under the
[SPEAKER_03]: stairs and then there's other cats,
you know who are like, yes We created that
[SPEAKER_03]: from our multi-thousand plant grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't we awesome?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we popped we popped 15 seeds and the
20th was the best So, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, you know, I Think the the truth is is
the the biggest factor for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, there's an aspect where and you
know, we should say this too is that truth
[SPEAKER_02]: is a most people Everyone likes to say
they want the truth, but like people that
[SPEAKER_02]: really care about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a really small percentage Yeah,
oh most people like truth if it helps them
[SPEAKER_02]: burnish their money or their reputation or
whatever else Sure, and the truth is
[SPEAKER_03]: usually boring You know people who are
looking for excitement from the truth
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna be like, oh, well that was
lame Yeah, something up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care Especially when the answer is
99% of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's a bad seed Or yeah, or you know
or it happened an accident at my buddy's
[SPEAKER_02]: house This or I was you know, like,
you know, you were early involved and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know the story even just knowing the story
is cool Right, but then people want to be
[SPEAKER_02]: part like they want to be this active
Component that was critical to the story,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know Right, and I did forget someone
earlier that was really important when I
[SPEAKER_06]: was was, you know Coming in and that was
that was doing reversals before I was and
[SPEAKER_06]: that was rascal I think I think I would be
remiss not to mention him because he was
[SPEAKER_06]: doing good things and had legitimate cuts
You know for the most part as far as I
[SPEAKER_06]: know like he was doing good fucking work
and he was doing it at a time when it
[SPEAKER_06]: wasn't popular when people were pushing
back against feminine seed, so I give that
[SPEAKER_02]: guy props to all the stuff that that guy
made between whatever it was oh nine and
[SPEAKER_02]: twelve or whatever Yeah, all those hybrids
are fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was some good shit in there I
mean really I'm not maybe not all but like
[SPEAKER_02]: the vast majority of the stuff He had some
really nice cuts and he was crossing them
[SPEAKER_02]: together and they led to some really nice
things Yeah, I mean white fire,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know A lot of people don't even know
like about the white anymore Like not a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of people talk about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the essence behind the white
fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fucking cool, right, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah That That's one I'd like to touch on
too in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, they they you know does it the
swamp boys big Ricky in particular he he's
[SPEAKER_03]: alluded a lot to Knowing exactly what the
hybrid of the white is because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: supposedly a TK hybrid But you know,
he he likes riddles and secrets so Riddles
[SPEAKER_03]: and limericks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it a haiku hillbilly haiku Like
sometimes I wonder how long he takes to
[SPEAKER_02]: craft Some of his Instagram posts and how
to make it like, you know, he cuz he's got
[SPEAKER_02]: his own language When it comes to that,
you know, have you seen have you seen
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff like the white inside the TKS ones?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah there there was a there was one
plant in our first run of them where
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, there was there was there was
four plants that we pulled out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: first run and One was a green girl scout
cookie like a green form cut Other was a
[SPEAKER_03]: plant that looked just like the white,
you know not oh but so similar Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was obvious and then there was the
number 50 and the 51 were which were my
[SPEAKER_03]: two actual favorites of the whole bunch
and then, you know, I I smoked both those
[SPEAKER_03]: heavily and the 50 turned out to be my
absolute favorite of the whole bunch and
[SPEAKER_03]: so that's the one I kept and Still play
with from the first and then I did another
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred plus, you know TKS one pop and you
know Got other selections from there Yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: So Caleb, what do you think about cookies?
[SPEAKER_06]: Great question from an ass.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that goes into the category of
2000 What 2010 and on for 2010-2011?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah people people ask a bunch of that and
I think I mean, it's a story You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's a story that like there's a lot
of pieces that aren't known that well But
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a definitely one that's gonna create
a let's you know, it's a super popular
[SPEAKER_02]: brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of money involved there's a
lot of rep involved and It's one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: things if you don't get it exactly right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be gunning for you Here's a
relevant one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a relevant one for you Caleb.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you gonna s1 any of the nl selections?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gonna leave that up to you,
buddy Yeah Yeah, no, I think they'd be
[SPEAKER_03]: worth it I think they do that,
you know, I like my feminized so I'll grow
[SPEAKER_03]: some of Matt's s1 and else.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we kept him here for goddamn a long

confidence to say you people would want to
[SPEAKER_02]: hear it Let's chat.

[SPEAKER_02]: like a lot of this stuff we're talking
about with you guys This is what we have
[SPEAKER_02]: all been doing amongst each other
privately for fucking ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah So we've all heard each other's
stupid fucking stories a hundred times,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know and and all that and so this is
this is really how information gets
[SPEAKER_02]: information and cuts get saved and shared
and you know history survives and
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally the point of all this is to get
you know versions of history out there and
[SPEAKER_02]: gets passed along Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, the other people can hear it.
