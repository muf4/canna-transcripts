[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_03]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_03]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_03]: seat.
[SPEAKER_03]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_03]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_03]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_03]: The syndicate is a collection of seed
makers that want to push back against all
[SPEAKER_03]: the smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_03]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Matthew here with my co-host
Thousandfold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And today we're going to be joined by
Michael and Hamlet.
[SPEAKER_03]: of C2 Custom Creations, someone we've been
working closely with lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really enjoy their glass,
but they both have a lot of history in the
[SPEAKER_03]: scene, a lot more than just glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to take the time to speak
with them and bring them to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thousand, take it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you both so much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, man, this is definitely the first
episode where we actually talk to people
[SPEAKER_05]: who work with glass, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is something I've been wanting to do
really, really bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's an art form I'm super
interested in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll just say for myself as well,
like being in New Zealand, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure all we get to see is like
cheap Chinese stuff or like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: Gatorade bottles with pipes shoved into
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I actually have really, really enjoyed
learning a little bit more about where the
[SPEAKER_05]: glass tech has gone and a little bit about
the history.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll say as well that, you know,
C2 Custom Creations, y'all are based in
[SPEAKER_05]: Eugene, technically, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Cal, baby.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Michael, did you spend time in Eugene
earlier on yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Born and raised in Eugene.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think we started at the start.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to ask you both.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm aware that the two of you have had
maybe quite different journeys initially.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe you all can take turns.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the first question is, how did you get
into either cannabis or glass,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, depending on which one came
first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabis, pretty normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I come from a small town, Eugene,
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Its herb is super prevalent there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grew up.
[SPEAKER_02]: My family itself was real conservative.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never saw my parents drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just never around.
[SPEAKER_02]: But about 1988, I'm sure the dead had
visited before, but they started a tour
[SPEAKER_02]: that came to Austin Stadium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the first time that I had
seen like that many hippies and just like
[SPEAKER_02]: counterculture people in the city ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember my parents had told me,
do not go near the stadium for this
[SPEAKER_02]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the first thing I did was I jumped
on my bike, passed, went straight to the
[SPEAKER_02]: stadium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got off my bike, walked around through
Shakedown Street.
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked up and down the booths.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the crazy plastic bongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea what they were for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I knew it's definitely smelled
different than anything I had ever seen
[SPEAKER_02]: before, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's really how old were
you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I was in probably in between 11 and
12 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when I definitely at least
started my interest of what was going on
[SPEAKER_02]: something that I had never seen before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fast forward a few years and I was in high
school.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few of my friends had been smoking weed
and I hadn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I made a deal with one of them to
where they could give me just a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'd bring it home and me and my one of
my little brothers would try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we tried to figure out how to get the
the Coke can to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, our best to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea if it worked or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's pretty much my first experience
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you just throw the chunk on the just a
chunk of it on the can?
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had been snowing the night before.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a little bit of snow on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember we maybe got one or two hits
before that thing fell in the snow and we
[SPEAKER_02]: were on our knees trying to find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as far as getting into glass
after that first time of smoking,
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely, I was interested in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I continued to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in Eugene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we were real fortunate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would go down to 13th Street which was
close to the university and there'd always
[SPEAKER_02]: be hippies down there and you'd walk by
them and they'd whisper, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: nugs or this or that and if you had 40
bucks, you can get a really nice sack of
[SPEAKER_02]: weed even as a little kid, a high school
kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I was real fortunate in that
it was easy to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, after high school, I went to the
University of Oregon and I had ran into a
[SPEAKER_02]: friend from high school that had started
working at a glass shop and he invited me
[SPEAKER_02]: over to the glass shop to kind of see what
was going on and at that point,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had made some pretty good connections
with with weed and I was getting good weed
[SPEAKER_02]: regularly and I guess the owner of that
glass shop was from California and what he
[SPEAKER_02]: had done is moved to Eugene and started a
small shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I showed him some of the weed I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was real interested in it and I made an
agreement with him where, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be willing to hook you up with this
weed when I get it regularly but I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: learn how to make those pipes because the
pipes, you know, they were about the
[SPEAKER_02]: coolest thing other than the weed itself
that I'd ever seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I made a deal with him and I got
into the shop that way and they basically
[SPEAKER_02]: just started me out as an apprentice on an
apprentice program and I took it from
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just within a year, I had dropped out of
the University of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not a real trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Went on my merry way with weed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's like how you broker your way
into a trade though, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you have to find ways to to get
yourself into different trades as a young
[SPEAKER_03]: man during that era.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everything was just laid out for you
as a not super rich kid, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to you had to have something to
offer to even get in the door there and
[SPEAKER_02]: that was one of the coolest things about
that shop because looking back,
[SPEAKER_02]: most of the kids in that shop were under
25 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I was either 19 or 20 and every
one of them brought something different to
[SPEAKER_02]: the table as far as weed goes and I could
tell they all got their jobs the same
[SPEAKER_02]: exact way I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes sense, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason why I mentioned Eugene
obviously in the introduction for those of
[SPEAKER_05]: you who may not know is that it's
recognized as one of the places for glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I correct in saying that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Harold did like an era in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's where Bob Snoggrass kind of
laid his flag and he's really like the
[SPEAKER_02]: first fumed glass pipe maker that was well
known.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think he had been slinging
pipes on the dead tours of the 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even sure but he's a great guy and
he was the one that basically started the
[SPEAKER_02]: glass pipes and if you wanted to learn how
to make a glass pipe in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_02]: you needed to know someone that had either
learned from him or one of his apprentices
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think that's kind of we all,
you know, grow from the roots of that
[SPEAKER_02]: tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's some really cool historical.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sign posting there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about you, Hamlet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I remember I was fourteen and I
had a really stressful day and my circle
[SPEAKER_01]: of friends were always older than me
growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of my friends saw what I was going
through and it just passed me a joint and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never smoked before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen people smoking stuff and
I was and I wasn't about it but that day I
[SPEAKER_01]: was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna give this a try and when I did
it, it changed my life really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was like, oh, I can feel like this
instead of being, you know, all fucked up
[SPEAKER_01]: and stressed out of my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and that token, I don't know
what kind of weed it was or what strain or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything when I smoked it felt great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started looking more into it and I
realized that there's a whole scene with
[SPEAKER_01]: like graphics and glass pieces being made
because of it and this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, wait a minute,
my dad's been a glass floor for all his
[SPEAKER_01]: life, even before I was born.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was an internationally known glass
floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked in all kinds of different
projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing to do with weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scientific stuff, a lot of aerospace
stuff, satellite, this, this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just kind of grew up around that and
I never really looked at it that way until
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that kind of week when I started
looking more into smoking and this,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, wait a minute, this is
something here, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So growing up, I showed more and more
interest in the glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I was about 17 years old,
he used to work at a company called
[SPEAKER_01]: SciTech Glass out of Moorpark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think at the time they were actually in
a different city.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and he, I got a summer job there one
time, you know, during break.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned a few things and,
and it was a short time job, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a short period.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got out and started talking to my dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, well, listen, you know,
we could, we can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could make pipes and like, I'm learning
and you can teach me more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was a little hesitant, but he
wanted to, you know, he was tired of
[SPEAKER_01]: working for somebody else for,
you know, most of his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made a good living, but then again,
working for somebody else is not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we opened 1994.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember like yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: January 5th, I was 17 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: We opened up a shop, put one lathe in
there, one torch, small shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he still kept his job for about a year
after that, going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was working at nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was learning how to do prep on glass
during the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would teach me things along the
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is how kind of started going
glass and we kind of like more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: into it, you know, before that,
I was just getting high, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a, it's a funny story actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, Hamlin, before you go on,
can I just ask, were you already,
[SPEAKER_05]: did you already know how to work with
glass before you were 17?
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched most of my childhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it and I didn't know until that
summer job I had at the, at the company
[SPEAKER_01]: that my father used to work at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of where I picked up some
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and my dad saw that I was picking up
pretty quick and it's, and you can kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: feel it if you're going to like this or
you're going to hate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you pick it up a day or two,
you're going to know if you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue or you're just going to be done
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I want to learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to learn more techniques and how to
do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he saw that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went forward with that for that
reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was your dad like stoked that you were
getting into it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he was.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was, he was really happy about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was excited that I was doing pretty
good with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, he would show me
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next day in the daytime,
I would make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prep it for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would come from after the job,
this new business we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would see all the parts that I
made, all the prep work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you, you know, he was excited about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, Oh my God, this is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can use this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to mess with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to change it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm picking it up pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, a couple of times he got a
little upset because I was doing other
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, trying to make my own pipe and this
and he's like, no, you're not ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you got to do the steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, you know, like everybody
else, I'm trying to jump ahead and do what
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do and make a pipe for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take away before he even gets there,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't like me smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he was like, Oh, you know,
you shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're young.
[SPEAKER_01]: This that you shouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your mom doesn't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I later on in life, I realized it was
mainly because my mom didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would eat weed on his own, but we kept
it from each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, he would smoke blunts and
come home and tell me I can't smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what the fuck is wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's how it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's mainly to keep my mom and to
keep the house sane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, we don't want her pissed at me
or him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how that went with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just did more and more with
the class.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was times along the years where I
did my own thing on the side, but I always
[SPEAKER_01]: left my foot in there, like help them with
the business and did other things and try
[SPEAKER_01]: to progress and give new ideas and like
pressure because he was older,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with all the crowd to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was basically like spliffs,
really just tobacco and weed mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: together and, you know, with papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I showed him like the glass
scene and what's available.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the scientific stuff is coming
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like things are getting involved and it's
getting more intricate and nicer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we kind of built on that together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there was a lot of hard times
along the way, but it grew faster than we
[SPEAKER_01]: thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within like a little bit short of a
year, he quit the other job.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're full time into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're working side by side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was learning more because when I made
a mistake, he was right there on top of
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was right there next to me telling me,
oh, do this like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could do this like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that, putting it together from
what I'm learning and putting my input
[SPEAKER_01]: into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we kind of just went with the
scientific line with it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just progressed with that, the class.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this funny story from where the old
shop was, actually, there was a this kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a side story, but there was a whole
race scene, like import car racing that
[SPEAKER_01]: was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would work late nights because it
was just cooler and temperatures were
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were always here, these cars racing
right outside of the shop on the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess one day cops pulled up and all
these race cars just flooded our parking
[SPEAKER_01]: lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and my dad, the crazy ass that
he was, he jumped out there with his
[SPEAKER_01]: rifle, like a big ass rifle stood out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I don't know who these fuckers
are, but they're not fucking with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah, no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of these guys was actually fucking
Oregon kid, Ken.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Ken.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's the first met him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just kind of drove by and then
reversed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was almost even in shop because he
was trying to reverse in close to the
[SPEAKER_01]: shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like putting his pipe out the window.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm friendly with all this shit going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my dad's like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, maybe we'll talk to him
for a sec.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll give him a chance to see what he's
got to say before fucking kills him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's like, no, I like weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I want to see what you guys have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I know you guys are going awesome
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the torches driving by and this and
he was pretty ballsy for doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we became really close friends,
you know, like really close friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the family, with him, with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he actually introduced me to Kush and
which I've never smoked before.
[SPEAKER_01]: OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I smoked that, I was like,
what the fuck is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a life changing weed the first
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the OG Kush from him first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubba Kush from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Banana Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably Blackberry Kush too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recall that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't memorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely not memorable now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush is what's stuck in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I smoked that and inhaled it
and exhaled it and I felt that flavor in
[SPEAKER_01]: the eye, I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been smoking bullshit mids all this
time, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the best fucking weed I've ever
tasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to become really close friends
with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we were cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to a couple of festivals together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he had some parties at his house,
at my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hung out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What year was this roughly?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry?
[SPEAKER_05]: What year was this roughly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: 95, 96.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it went on from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I remember the OG Kush was the first
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then later on, there was more of the
flavors I got from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he actually pushed a lot of our line
and the features on our pipes because he
[SPEAKER_01]: would come up and be like, oh,
you know, you should do this or we should
[SPEAKER_01]: do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you should make a pipe that is this
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it'll give more flavor.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a lot of input with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was very much involved in the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would like, you know, hook him up
with pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would come by seconds from us all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a good relationship with him,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would give me the best weed I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would trade for glasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paid money for it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good time with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, kind of lost my chain of thought
with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nah, you're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think he was calling it OG Kush back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in reality, I'm pretty sure it was his
Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was his Bubba back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone was trying to call any good Kush
in the 90s OG here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that particular one was his Bubba.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the best weed I've smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it got me more into it, more
interested with it, trying to do more
[SPEAKER_01]: different perks, different ideas,
different ways we can cut the glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was all with like fuming and
clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is before all these colors and array
of palette that we have now that's
[SPEAKER_01]: available now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have that back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, silver, gold, and then a blue
came out randomly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was it for a good long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't have much variations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, like taking the techniques
that my dad had with the lab industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And incorporating it with the scientific
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: The glass picked up and we did well with
it, I think, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, next January, next year,
January will be 30 years that we started.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be called Potec glass back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't custom creations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is what I want to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how custom creations came to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: During this time, I had a smoke shop right
next to UCLA.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time I was doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was actually in the early 2000s,
I want to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called C2 smoke shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the C2 was, I had a partner at the
time and my friend, we were like trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: see if it was going to be their cotton
mouth corner or chronic corner smoke shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the C2 came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually C squared thinking it was
right next to UCLA.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would get it, but everybody was
calling it C2.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a big C with a little two on
the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Squared.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even the college kids, there's C2,
C2, C2, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was about a four year crazy ass
run at the only smoke shops between the
[SPEAKER_01]: only bar and the sorority run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was open from 3 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: to 3 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaning hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was some wild times in that smoke
shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can imagine all the drunk kids and
everyone coming through.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was about a four year run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I closed that off,
I was like, sorry, to backtrack a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit, when we were a high tech class,
we didn't really sell direct to stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of like shady back then
selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like it is now open.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to be low key with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real, real calm, like relaxed with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't be too much advertising,
too much of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were working with distributors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would make other people's lines for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we call high tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not the high tech you might have
heard of where they make the bottles like
[SPEAKER_01]: the Coca-Cola bottle looking one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we decided I was like, I stopped the
smoke shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had more hours and more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, let's just have our own line
and sell direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already had the C2 corporation name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, how can we incorporate this
with this and change it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we changed high tech to custom
creations because it fit the C square.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the name came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jumping the pipe dreams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm just going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget what year it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that was the time we had to stop
making pipes and we started making
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that we can out of glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because Ashcroft and pipe dreams
came down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It scared the shit out of everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just completely all our
distributors, all our accounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They stopped carrying glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to I just want to interrupt
and make it really clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: Operation pipe dreams was an FBI
operation, a crackdown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marshals and certain attorney generals
from certain states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pennsylvania, Iowa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember the third.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might have been Indiana.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was during the Bush administration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right after the kills got busted,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was basically a few attorney
generals from the United States were able
[SPEAKER_02]: to bring charges for people out of state
for shipping something illegal into their
[SPEAKER_02]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Illegal meaning glass pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mainly.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I imagine.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was also a time when the glass scene
was like virgin thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
Like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was starting to get big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we were starting to have big trade
shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was getting too big for their comfort.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Drone Baker was really big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they hit him hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drone Baker got hit hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of big companies got hit hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our distributor got hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're like, what do we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, jewelry, like some mugs,
cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say they're not paying the bills.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, well, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about Tildos?
[SPEAKER_01]: Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sex toys.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the company I'm working with,
they had some stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came to this organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: They contacted us like, yeah, sure,
we can make those.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, whatever you want, what color
you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dick was the model.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an imaginary dick, I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that's fair.
[SPEAKER_05]: Idealized.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did have some specific ones that
came with specific sizing and shapes and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extra, you know, extra large ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you got to fit every one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made this for Bella Donna.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like a tabletop thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like, no kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fucking incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people paid for these, though,
like like the big, big monster ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like, yeah, I need that one in
my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a special order from her porn
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was mainly for like the porn
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually made fucking a chandelier
for Hugh Hefner.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has like like fucking glass dicks
like lined up on top on top of the light
[SPEAKER_01]: bulb.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's sick.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we had a few different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not see you taking this interview
into the phallic space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to do something to keep the
company going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, yeah, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to pay the bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the name of the distributor with
phallics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were in Playboy and Hustler and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Playboy TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was another company, too,
that was buying them from us as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, this episode is already like iconic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you when you got into this stage,
like obviously there was a point when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're like, OK, pipe dreams kind of is
cooling down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we can get back into bongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you drop the dicks after that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you just be like, let's keep rolling
with the dicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is good money.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to let that go because China got
involved and India and imports and all
[SPEAKER_01]: this was just like no money in it left.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chinese are in the dicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was a short thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they say it's quite a few years to
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got back into Gaspar and Jack were
making those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so like three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So half the shop was still doing it for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we trickled back into pipes and
like tested the grounds on that to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure it's still safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how that went.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three, three, three years, I think it was
gone after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was funny is we'd be at a party with
like all of his dad's friends and he'd
[SPEAKER_02]: make it real clear to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can mention that we make pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell anyone we're making those sex
toys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want anyone knowing we're making
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had we had pipes that look like,
you know, that look like dicks and tits
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was turning into a whole part of
the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: So wait, hold on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to double check on one
thing, which is when did you two actually
[SPEAKER_05]: meet?
[SPEAKER_05]: When did you two actually meet and how did
you meet?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so I actually met his father way
before I met him.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the same distributor that would
sell our glass pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I first met his dad, he was
pretty early with his English.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't great back then.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So wait, this is this is pre dildo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this is pre dildo.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is pre dildo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would always see him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, coming from a small
town, I had no idea what an Armenian was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never heard that term before and I'd
never seen that country on a map.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like when I would call my mom and talk
to her and tell her about people I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: meeting and different things I'm seeing,
I'd be like, man, you know, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of these Russian guys down here in Los
Angeles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it ended up came to be is that
there is a pretty healthy Armenian
[SPEAKER_02]: population here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his father was an Armenian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we ran into each other at our
distributor one day, and he's trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't understand he's he's got a
real thick accent, you know, and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: having a hard time understanding what he's
trying to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he pulls someone over one of his
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next time we were going to drop off
product because we did our drops on the
[SPEAKER_02]: same days, he had a friend come over that
spoke a little more English.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what he was trying to explain was,
hey, I'm a professional at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people and have taught
a lot of people how to decorate the glass
[SPEAKER_02]: but you're you're not a professional
glassblower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know anything outside of the few
things you know how to do, which was
[SPEAKER_02]: entirely true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was explaining that let's team up
so that you can communicate for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make sure we're making the coolest,
like best stuff that you can find and we
[SPEAKER_02]: can be partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he actually he worked on me for a good
six months to a year with that idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I finally was like, you know what,
let's just give it a try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I want to know how the lathes work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I all my experiences in hand blown glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's just let's give it a try.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I met you at my father's
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I was come stopping by and I saw him
with his wife at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, is this and
introducing this and that and and I was at
[SPEAKER_01]: the time I was having a little tip with my
with my dad like everyone else,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like working.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not easy working with your father.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, especially your father.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine he was a tough guy to work
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're having back and forth and
this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was really short and I was kind of a
dick to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I was like I saw him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, I'm out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but he did not be a great friend
and a great guy like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was the first time I met him at
my father's house through through him and
[SPEAKER_01]: realized that they're trying to start a
venture together with the business and
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporate things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I stepped back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, OK, we can do clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do scientific.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do different perks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do different sizes and shaping all
this stuff and kind of like put basically
[SPEAKER_01]: all three of our minds together and
progress that with the class.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so we come back to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I keep referring to it as this,
but we come back to the post dildo period
[SPEAKER_03]: post dildo eras.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's post.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're getting you know, you guys are
getting back into the pipes at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, what happens from that
point between that point and where we are
[SPEAKER_05]: now?
[SPEAKER_02]: In what way?
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as how our glass has grown,
how the industry has changed, like what
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe a bit?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be both.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe like what stands out to you from
that period on?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because what year would that have been
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say probably 2005 to 2006 is when
you really saw a transition in water pipes
[SPEAKER_02]: from just being a beaker or a colored work
bubble at the end of a straight tube and
[SPEAKER_02]: the rubber grommets with rubber grommets
to be having like the percolation and the
[SPEAKER_02]: function of the pieces be the most
important thing and not so much just the
[SPEAKER_02]: the colors of the artwork.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, I do want to.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, I do want to say this here because in
my mind before I looked looked a bit
[SPEAKER_05]: deeper into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And exactly what you're saying in my mind
in 2023, a bong is something with a
[SPEAKER_05]: chamber.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a bowl and a mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's all I knew.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so kind of finding out about perks,
ratchets, recyclers, like all these things
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of blew my mind, honestly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: But please.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please continue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think at that point, there was
enough people that had left the scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: industry or had been trained in scientific
glass blowing that they could add to what
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say the minimal knowledge of like the
art glass community had as far as function
[SPEAKER_02]: and seals and some of that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the division between scientific
and and because I remember when that
[SPEAKER_03]: started popping up on websites where you
could buy glass, you know, like I
[SPEAKER_03]: remember, oh, there's a second scientific.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I never to this day, probably until
this conversation, I never even could
[SPEAKER_03]: grasp what that meant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is this one scientific versus this one
recycler?
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout the glass history, like
scientific glass was kind of stayed away
[SPEAKER_01]: from the pipe scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, they acted like they were too
good or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they want to mess with the
pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that whole science industry got turned
upside down when everything started being
[SPEAKER_01]: imported.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: By being outsourced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, these guys that have all
these factories and equipment and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, materials and they can't use it
because they can't sell it to anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't compete.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of a sudden, you know, OK,
like we'll get into the pipe industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, OK, you know, it's kind of
like that with my father, too,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to talk them into it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when we first opened up a shop,
he was trying to pick up the science
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was like a dying market in
America because, again, everything was
[SPEAKER_01]: being imported, being outsourced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, they kind of merged like all
these science guys and these high
[SPEAKER_01]: technical glass floors got into the scene
with all these other artists that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the art aspect of it and the colors
and the working of it of making it pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: and aesthetically pleasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the science guys came in
like, OK, we can make it look pretty,
[SPEAKER_01]: aesthetically pleasing, and we can add art
thing to it and make it more percolation,
[SPEAKER_01]: double chamber, triple chamber.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: More functionality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having different perks, different ideas
and then bring and then that's kind of how
[SPEAKER_01]: the quartz thing came into it,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I started talking about quartz
and making quartz nails, people didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know what the fuck that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: We even got knocked off a couple of times
and it was made out of borosilicate glass,
[SPEAKER_01]: which explodes if you try to torch it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my god.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, because it's not made for
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperature differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and it was titanium
changing to quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was, you know, like we're pushing
all the scientific guys were pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: quartz because they worked with quartz
before and they've done a lot of course
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how we used to the company I used
to work at, they used to make big like
[SPEAKER_01]: four foot, five foot table size.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were called quartz bolts and wafer
holders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had the satellite like the
reflective wafers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will cook inside of these things in a
quartz lineup where it doesn't give off
[SPEAKER_01]: anything and it's clean and it would heat
to a point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that knowledge was brought in
mainly due to economics, really,
[SPEAKER_01]: because people had to make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: People had to keep working.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they kind of forced themselves
like they had forced themselves to jump
[SPEAKER_01]: into this and and and mold into the weed
industry and try to progress the pipes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm so glad that we mentioned this
because I watched a little documentary
[SPEAKER_05]: called Degenerate Art on on the glass pipe
scene.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one thing that I was wondering about,
because most of the work that was featured
[SPEAKER_05]: in that was very, very sculptural.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of I imagine that's what you were
referring to as art glass, Michael.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I I was particularly interested in
this turning point.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm I'm really glad that you guys have
expanded on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm trying to remember back to like
the first companies that were really
[SPEAKER_02]: pushing like the new scientific stuff
before we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Doro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Roar started using the glass on
glass stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember Toro being like the first
place I saw the tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there was a couple of ones before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was a couple of ones before we
even we used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I forgot about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to make the liquid chamber glass
before, like Illedelf or any other
[SPEAKER_01]: companies are doing it back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we would mix food coloring
and not closer at the time alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Freezing when we're shipping it over to
states that are, you know, cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember actually making one of the
first hand pipes and it made it onto
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael Douglas's The Game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you guys ever seen that
movie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seen what they're trying to where they're
trying to frame him and they show the
[SPEAKER_01]: bathroom that there's like a teal looking
pipe there and some crack and some other
[SPEAKER_01]: shit or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I made that pipe and I saw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, my God, this is fucking
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I just you know, it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right there in the movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never got credit for anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I made that from nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made it the first liquid filled hand
pipe, which was that little piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we used to cork it and seal it with
the epoxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it lasted for a good while,
you know, until we got knocked off and
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody else started making it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a crazy story, too, because I used
to go to smoke shops to get business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that was one of the worst things
I did walking into a smoke shop that I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know is affiliated with a bunch of
glass blowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, oh, yeah, we like these
pieces took one of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next, you know, hey, they're
trying to they're trying to make their
[SPEAKER_01]: version of it, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but the idea that scientific and
and artistic kind of merged there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also when you say art class,
there is also a soft glass form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if you guys are aware of
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's like, oh, yeah, like really
artistic, colorful, you know, bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces like bases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like if you've been that was at the
wind, the chandelier, I think it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: Blasio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the Blasio has a giant like chandelier
on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you guys have been to
Vegas and a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a few well-known artists that
have been doing that for years,
[SPEAKER_01]: stemming from Italy, like doing that old
school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they take the stick and they dip it
in the glass, pull it out and form it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where our glass, everything starts with
like a tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a scientific tube and we form from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a different type of glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one is soft glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is borosilicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the art industry is kind of like merged
between that and the borosilicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just everything kind of stacked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the timing was right for everything to
go that direction, you know, to get all
[SPEAKER_01]: those types of pieces and the companies
popping out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did want to also signpost here for
people like me who didn't really know
[SPEAKER_05]: about some of this tech previously.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to kind of like generalize a bit on
the engineering side.
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine most of these advancements had
to do with how the flow of smoke and air
[SPEAKER_05]: was being mediated in the glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Research and development, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Research and development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every school one of them motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think each one of the companies
that have been able to survive that make
[SPEAKER_02]: this kind of what I call is like a
scientific art glass have their own own
[SPEAKER_02]: way of doing things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for C2, we have been really on top
of fast flow, easy function with coming up
[SPEAKER_02]: with percolators that don't cost hundreds
upon hundreds of dollars to produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that that's kind of where we.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I always had like the end user in
mind, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we don't want to overcharge because
we made something new and nobody has this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we kind of went the different route
and charged so much more and sold one or
[SPEAKER_01]: two pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where me, I was like, I want everyone to
experience this piece and everyone to feel
[SPEAKER_01]: what it's like to smoke out of a piece
that percolates better, that filters easy
[SPEAKER_01]: to clean, easy to, you know, it's just
it's more functional.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, let's just try to get it
to everyone instead of having a very small
[SPEAKER_01]: niche market where only a few people can
afford it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing I ideal, that's kind of how
our pipes work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting the smoke from point A to
point B as quick as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting the pipes to, you know,
person to person as quick as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a many there's been many,
many designs where we discontinued.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just like, oh, this isn't working out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we try to change it up a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that happen to drag?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very hard to clean or too much drag or too
flowy or slack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or any kind of things that are not
positive and they don't work out the right
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just kind of get rid of or just
change up the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I observed when I was looking at
your catalog and gallery that I thought
[SPEAKER_05]: was really interesting was that it seems
like, you know, the overall structure of
[SPEAKER_05]: your pieces are, you know, again,
like fairly scientific, but it's kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: within the chamber that you guys kind of
let some of that more like creative juice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like flow a bit or like the art pops a bit
more like in pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you talking about the more like the
sculpted pieces that are sculpted inside?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's just taking our normal
perks and letting, you know, letting us
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of run with whatever we can possibly
do in that small space.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can add.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I was just wondering, like,
is that like an interesting set of
[SPEAKER_05]: constraints to work with when you,
you know, that tiny space that you have to
[SPEAKER_05]: work with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, especially when you introduce so
many different colors, because with glass,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of different colors work and
cooperate differently with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some are not compatible with the
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the temperature
differences, you have to do minor
[SPEAKER_01]: adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have we have a lot more breaking and
cracking issues when it comes to having
[SPEAKER_01]: sculpted pieces and having a fine
finalized piece that's okay to go versus
[SPEAKER_01]: clear where it's all the same type glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it all works close and it's easier to
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes, it does complicate a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it changes the dynamics of like how
what temperatures we have to kiln it at,
[SPEAKER_01]: how many times we can kiln it,
the color variations we can get from the
[SPEAKER_01]: different temperatures we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that affects the outside shape,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a good balance we have to
come up with to get those completed and
[SPEAKER_01]: done right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then but for the finished piece,
we have an idea of what the the end
[SPEAKER_02]: diameter and circumference is going to be
inside the tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of know how much work we have
to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's about whether or not we can
fit what we want to within those
[SPEAKER_02]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes we have bigger pieces
because of it, because it didn't fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're like, OK, let's go to the next
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we go from a 65 millimeter to 80
millimeter or 100 or 10 millimeter now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, OK, we made a part for 110.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't fit right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to figure out what we're going
to put it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll blow out the 110 and make it a
little bit bubbly shape so it has more
[SPEAKER_01]: circumference and room in it to put the
art piece that we want inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it all kind of it's like it's like you
kind of do it and then just judge it by
[SPEAKER_01]: then and try to plan it as much as you
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But things change.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what I like about it, I mean,
of course, the whole thing is a piece of
[SPEAKER_05]: art.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other way I can see it is that
like the clear part is like the frame
[SPEAKER_05]: almost or a stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's the more sculpted bit
kind of like foregrounded or centered,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I call those my are captured series
because it's like capturing the art in a
[SPEAKER_01]: dome, kind of like old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like those creatures or a hand or whatever
in the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea, you know, frozen in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Reminds me of like a snow globe as well,
in a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the egg series was definitely kind of
like that for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it must be interesting to try to
balance this kind of like aesthetic and
[SPEAKER_05]: function at the same time, like always
trying to find that balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I will say one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the custom pieces work great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's pure function for me
personally, I will always go with the
[SPEAKER_02]: clear pieces because I think they.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the lines of it haven't having like
straight, smooth lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes the smoke travel easier,
faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can control the chamber size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Better versus having a sculpted head where
it takes up a lot of the space and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not exactly sure how much room you have in
there for smoke, where it's clear and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have this size on the inside and
the other size on the outside,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, exact volume of smoke and air is
coming through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can really dial in it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of our like artistic pieces,
first we dialed it in with a hole in that
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific part and then incorporated the
art part into it to make sure it works and
[SPEAKER_01]: functions and then introduce the art.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other way around would be a lot
harder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that's yeah, this is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what I wanted to hear out of this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like these are all the things that like I
just had no idea about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I didn't need so much for I've
shot for glass for years and had no like I
[SPEAKER_03]: just looked at color shape.
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why isn't that more this color?
[SPEAKER_03]: This color?
[SPEAKER_03]: I had no clue about any of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fascinating from the art aspect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because I think I was saying this to
you, Spindle, in private.
[SPEAKER_05]: But being outside of the US, you know,
obviously, like any other part of the
[SPEAKER_05]: world, we get a lot of American culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is definitely not a part of
American culture that most of the world
[SPEAKER_05]: has access to or has much insight into.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think this episode is actually going
to be really cool for a lot of people who
[SPEAKER_05]: are overseas, even people in America who
may not know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people are really missing
out because there has been in the last 20
[SPEAKER_02]: years some absolutely incredible artwork
made by Pipe Makers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not saying like it's either of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is some really impressive stuff
that I mean, I've seen a lot of artwork as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't get me as excited as some
of the glass pieces I've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why I think it didn't get
traction is because it's part of the weed
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's still frowned upon in a lot of
places, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the art community as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first person I met in the glass
community, I was at some random festival
[SPEAKER_03]: in San Diego, like weed festivals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real random was Lacey, Laceface.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: She had her pieces there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I was mind blown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that this person right here had just
made this beautiful glass, like human,
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful female form sculpture.
[SPEAKER_01]: With all the parts and pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really cool to see in person.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was a real cool chick, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's an amazing artist, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, see, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: If she was, let's say, part of the art
scene and had nothing to do with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: weed, or smoking, I think she would have
been more world known and more famous for
[SPEAKER_01]: what she does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would guess so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the reality of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of that's changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's slowly going the right direction,
but it's very slow and it's been many,
[SPEAKER_01]: many years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if we take a little break from this
deep dive into the glass, which fuck I
[SPEAKER_05]: loved, what have we come back to the
timeline?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's happened for you both in the last,
I think, where were we last talking like
[SPEAKER_05]: mid 2000, like 2005, 2006?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's happened in the last 15 years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, after there was a period in there
where his father and I were business
[SPEAKER_02]: partners and then we split and I moved out
of state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And about that same time, Hamlet sold or
closed his head shop and came back to work
[SPEAKER_02]: with full time dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a few years after that,
or it wasn't too long, but I moved back to
[SPEAKER_02]: California to be with my family and we
decided, well, basically, Hamlet invited
[SPEAKER_02]: me back to so that we could all start
working together again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was when we really started,
I think, going crazy on new designs and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, really polishing it hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: The birds and doing the door seals and
changing our line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this happened to kind of coexist with
a time when a lot of the glassblowers were
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to like double, triple,
quadruple their prices on the water pipes
[SPEAKER_02]: to where they were getting like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to say ridiculous,
but they were really expensive,
[SPEAKER_02]: even for clear glass, it was getting
really, really expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I remember us button heads a
little bit about the whether to go the
[SPEAKER_01]: color direction, the art direction or to
focus on scientific.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously I was saying
scientific, you saying color and we were
[SPEAKER_01]: going back and forth until we all of that
kind of like merged in and with both of us
[SPEAKER_01]: did what we could.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since then, we've just kind of really
been, you know, hustling glass and pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: it and trying to do shows and events and
venues and anything we can to and coexist,
[SPEAKER_02]: coexist in the height of the the import
craze, where if we design something or
[SPEAKER_02]: someone famous design something,
it's going to be knocked off overseas
[SPEAKER_02]: within six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's a time where they locked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They knocked up our entire logo and they
were putting it on show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they put the whole thing on it.
And so that's the whole point of it.
And then the other thing that they did was
they had a whole bunch of these like nasty
[SPEAKER_01]: ass pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of a sudden downtown has all these
pipes that we never fucking seen before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't even function.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't even understand the way this
of smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the perks didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't even draw air through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just suck water straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like it would work as a straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like unusable pieces and has our
fucking name on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that can you can you give us an
insight into like what was their process
[SPEAKER_05]: like to make this really cheaply,
you know, in comparison, like how do,
[SPEAKER_05]: how were they doing this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think they used a lot of child
labor, child labor, no safety at all of
[SPEAKER_01]: any kind of cheap glass, you know,
and not actually worrying about the
[SPEAKER_01]: function just because they would,
I'm assuming they will look at a picture
[SPEAKER_01]: and video and like, okay, I need to make
this, but they don't even know what the
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck it was for a lot of times,
you know, or the person that's parts and
[SPEAKER_01]: the other person that's finishing off the
piece, they don't know what's what,
[SPEAKER_01]: or what is it used for or how even it's
used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why a lot of those pieces
wouldn't function.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't have a lot of big smokers in
China.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their fingers cut off or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I was just going to say,
I think that's kind of one of the ways
[SPEAKER_02]: that we really were able to say,
well, open for business when a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people close was the fact that we kept
progressing, creating new designs,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we've also done a good job of creating
stuff at the cheapest possible price point
[SPEAKER_02]: that it could be made in this country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, because we're all hands on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We make everything ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We fucking sweating tears into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not like, oh, yeah,
just tell this guy to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll take care of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's like, oh, we're involved in the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, from start to finish to when the
box leaves the fucking warehouse after
[SPEAKER_01]: it's packed, we throw out the whole
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at the top collecting a paycheck and
not coming to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's not a thing we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were able to definitely avoid that
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that cuts a lot of the costs and puts
the labor fact down and the labor costs
[SPEAKER_01]: down because we're doing it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't live like kings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We live like regular Joe Schmoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like what it takes to have a small
business in America today is stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you can't just you can't have a
bunch of employees anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't you have to do everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're self and cut every cut everything
down and be doing yourself essentially
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no money in this industry anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, the cool thing about about it is
us being like involved in the art and
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in the industry when we do have
employees working.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't I mean, not that they try to,
but they can't really get one over on us
[SPEAKER_01]: like other companies have where they're
just a boss running things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They has no idea how the glass works or
how it's made, you know, where if my guy
[SPEAKER_01]: is working and he's only making one of
these pieces where I'd be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, I could sit there and make three or
four and you're only making one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're fucking me like you're wasting my
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that helped, too,
with all the having the prices down and
[SPEAKER_01]: having it affordable for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and smoke shops across the country
love this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they love the fact that they can
get American made stuff that's made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that functions great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and the price points is realistic to
most of their customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that helped out a lot and and staying
in business and and keep doing what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And realistically, like, I know we've been
to a lot of trade shows where people think
[SPEAKER_02]: we're like a big factory company.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is literally Hamlet Eye and we try
really hard to make it look that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, you know, we've had people
call us a big shop, one of the big
[SPEAKER_02]: production shops before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm always like, yeah, it's literally
three of us like we're, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're good at what we do, you know,
and so maybe it seems that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we work our asses off, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, every single lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single one of the pieces was
designed or made by us, you know,
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to we had to narrow it down,
perfect it before it goes on to production
[SPEAKER_01]: and production, meaning we're still part
of it, you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, but it was a big front trying to
like, you know, stand up there with the
[SPEAKER_01]: big guys and be like, oh, yeah,
it's our company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is what we doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so we have this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a point at which, like,
you know, is the rise of import glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the next kind of thing that you all
saw as being like a big thing like
[SPEAKER_05]: Spindle?
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael, I know that we mentioned
Instagram at some point, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: emerging and what that how that affected
your scene as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there anything else in between the
import glass and Instagram or,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, that you would consider
significant?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I really think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Instagram really changed
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, put it in front of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you can dive into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think the whole Instagram era
of glass has been really, really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it definitely it can mimic in some
ways the seed business also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think originally when I got into
glass blowing and in the Oregon scene,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was a somewhat of a small it was still
a small scene like the Heddy's dot com
[SPEAKER_02]: guys were super famous for making
beautiful, nice stuff and being at the top
[SPEAKER_02]: of their game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with Instagram, you started seeing
guys that I had maybe never heard of or
[SPEAKER_02]: had never seen at a show really getting on
the scene and taking off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you start seeing these guys that you
know, they're on Instagram and they look
[SPEAKER_02]: very like the baller type thing going on,
like the compound guys, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're jet setting and flying all
over the world and they must make all this
[SPEAKER_02]: money and they're glass blowers,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had never seen that before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never, you know, as far as glass
blowers, I was like, I know some of us
[SPEAKER_02]: make some money, but I don't think
anyone's rich off of it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Instagram kind of changed that to
where, you know, people are like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, these glass blowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make so much money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, some of the really talented
guys would fall off a little and you
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't see them as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'd see these guys that maybe
weren't making the greatest glass in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world, just rising like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was definitely a change in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Social media did it for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, Facebook just kicked us all
out, you know, didn't want to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not, that's not an art.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Instagram is starting to,
they're, they're deleting accounts right
[SPEAKER_01]: and left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Glass and Seeds wrote the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same way that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think like, like as when, when growing
up, we knew like there were some Dutch
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders that were pretty rich,
but the idea of an American breeder making
[SPEAKER_03]: serious money was a joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Instagram came around and you got
to see like guys like flashing the Rolexes
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody assumed that all of us made
a bunch of money and no, no rent farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: at best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the majority of the glassblowers
that play that game too, it probably has
[SPEAKER_02]: more to do with the family they come from
than the circle of friends or smoke and
[SPEAKER_03]: mirrors.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're only going to sell so many $15,000
pipes a year and you can really only make
[SPEAKER_02]: so many a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that's one of the big
things that Instagram changed with the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram really introduced me more in
detail into dabbing and what we can do
[SPEAKER_01]: with dabbing tools and concentrates and
making pieces specifically for
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates and just condense them down
to smaller, more effective little pieces
[SPEAKER_01]: that are more like for flavor and not so
much for a volume of smoke or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the size of the piece that could
be so big and so many percolaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're having one little perk that works
perfect with the enough of a chamber where
[SPEAKER_01]: it saves all the flavor of your
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was another part of the line we
introduced too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started having these variety of
pieces that are smaller and more compact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just function ideally for
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was kind of an Instagram thing
for me too, because I started seeing more
[SPEAKER_01]: and more people getting into it and all
the, like the PHO stuff came and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the rosin and all this coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I remember the first time we went to
Vegas, what was that little show?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it age, the smaller one at the hotel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, age.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the first time I'd seen dab
breaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I just, it never been in my circle
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember we walked into the smoking
room and these guys are smoking on those
[SPEAKER_02]: dab breaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I looked at him and I was like,
Oh my God, dude, I think there's people
[SPEAKER_02]: free-basing in the corner over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, no, dude, they're just
dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, I swear like it tripped me
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks, it looks really weird at first
when you first see it, like, especially as
[SPEAKER_03]: you've, you've been around other worlds
and stuff and you see that you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: that what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is, this would be a weird
tangent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I sort of asked you a little bit
about it, but I thought maybe y'all could
[SPEAKER_05]: actually do a bit of a like glass taken to
2023 one-on-one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what is a percolator?
[SPEAKER_05]: What does it do?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to break the smoke up in the
water so that I guess there's more surface
[SPEAKER_02]: area of smoke hitting water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say, yeah, that's why different,
different perks work differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think because when you have a smaller,
more concentrated perk, you'll get small
[SPEAKER_01]: little tiny bubbles of smoke going through
the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially less smoke hits more water
than having the big chuggy like both,
[SPEAKER_01]: both, both action where like the big,
big bubbles come through and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke doesn't even touch the surface of
the water because of the bubbles going
[SPEAKER_01]: through our, our larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, was this, was this piece of tech
something that just like sort of came out
[SPEAKER_05]: of nowhere?
[SPEAKER_05]: Did it emerge slowly over time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I'd say it happened kind of using it,
just using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You realize that when you get a smoother
hit or you get a smoother smoke,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not choking you off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, you know, you don't get that
crazy cough afterwards or you just buy
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_05]: How did, how did the idea even come about?
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how did it come about?
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I'd say research and
development.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, this is a really competitive
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm sure all industries are,
but if you're not constantly coming out
[SPEAKER_02]: with something slightly different or new,
you're going to lose sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can have, we have two trade shows a
year, sometimes a few more than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I'd like to not remember
those, but let's say, let's say we have
[SPEAKER_02]: trade shows every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have something new to get
people excited about your product every
[SPEAKER_02]: time you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't, your company is going to
get stale and people are going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: bored.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's more a fact of, Hey, how can we
approve, improve on designs that we
[SPEAKER_02]: already have?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we get this pipe to hit better?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we make the people that want a
larger volume of smoke happier?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we get the people that want small
volumes of smoke happier?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's very true because we have
pieces that have the same item code that
[SPEAKER_01]: they did 10 years ago, but I would almost
say it looks completely different,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it has progressed and has grown into
the piece that is today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where it started and put them next to
each other and you'll see that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this is not the same thing,
but it just kind of like grew into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like, you know, like Michael was
saying, it's an extremely competitive
[SPEAKER_05]: environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everyone's forced to evolve really
fast, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's a ratchet?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would I describe that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ratchet is the perk that is like a disc
with cuts at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about like a ratcheting tool that
has the sprocket in it when, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it clicks when you try to tighten the bolt
or a nut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the inner part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we call it a ratchet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was the actual, the perk in the
piece kind of reminded me of the gear
[SPEAKER_01]: that's inside the ratchet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have this site up on here and I'm trying
to find where on the site I could show a
[SPEAKER_03]: ratchet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're just lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where was it at?
[SPEAKER_01]: The color pieces in the beginning,
you show even the artwork ones that have
[SPEAKER_01]: ratchet perks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're those all the whole top line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, except the one on the right is
ratchet perks.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go down, you'll see the cuts
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look at it from the bottom or
the top, it looks like a gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a specific kind of perk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one's really, really sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all, I think y'all have no idea how many
people are like, we'll be learning,
[SPEAKER_05]: encountering this for the very first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perks, which is more predominant in a lot
of different companies, ratchet perks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We came up with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a few different companies that
make it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, but yeah, it was our thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're Kings of ratchets.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ratchet Kings.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like as a strain strain person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, uh, when I got into weed,
I really like narrowly focused my,
[SPEAKER_03]: my experience and view on what I really,
really, really wanted to learn about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And glass has always been something I'm
interested in, but never really jumped
[SPEAKER_03]: into because one, it is so expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I go into collecting anything,
I go all in and I never wanted to go all
[SPEAKER_01]: in there because that's all you can spend
upwards of a hundred thousand dollars on
[SPEAKER_01]: one piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Easy out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all this is still new to me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's going to be a lot of
people that, that have been around for a
[SPEAKER_03]: long time that use pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know much about the actual
industry, the form, what's gone into it,
[SPEAKER_03]: the history and any of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go back to the top of the page.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a gallery section.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you hit that, um, which one is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or actually the catalog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, well, yeah, you can see one of the
ratchets being made here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the base being blown out and you
can see the ratchets inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go to, um, um, catalog,
a lot of the clear pieces are in there as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll be able to see, um,
our production line from simple beakers to
[SPEAKER_01]: simple ratchets and just gets bigger and
crazier and crazier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those parts in those pieces,
cause they are clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, let me see if I can, uh,
get mine up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a double ratchet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five millimeter double ratchet.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had one last question on these terms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and I don't know if this one's as
relevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is Matt's custom logo.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the best places to get affordable
American glass is through the Breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: Syndicate Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I catch what you said.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, what's a recycler?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something that's relevant to what
you guys make?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if it's in there, let's see if you
could, I think there's one right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You passed it right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's not recycled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no, you guys scroll more, but it
recycles the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, the, essentially the, the,
the water that the smoke bubbles through,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll pull the bubbles and it'll pull the
smoke and the water in a certain chamber
[SPEAKER_01]: and it will separate the smoke to go up to
the mouthpiece and the water will go back
[SPEAKER_01]: down into the bottom of the piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially the water keeps circulating
around the piece over and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the recycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: We introduced a recycler back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an internal recycler and most
people didn't even know what the fuck was
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't take off because of that
because people didn't understand it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we didn't explain it very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just made it, threw it out there and a
few people were so fucking stoked about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people were like, well,
what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I don't understand what
the, what the thing is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now recyclers are huge and every
company has recyclers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't always pay to be first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't sometimes, sometimes too early.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm not, I'm not a dabber,
but, um, recyclers are one of the most
[SPEAKER_02]: overrated things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in glass, as far as glass water
pipes, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a carnivore and you get really
into it, it's like the way you hit a
[SPEAKER_01]: recycler is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of start hitting it before you
put your concentrate on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to kind of get the water
circulating and doing its thing before you
[SPEAKER_01]: put your introduce your concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's very, you know, like that's
what I say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recycler is mainly for concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes a lot more sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't smoke concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was one of the people that used
recyclers for, for we, cause I thought
[SPEAKER_03]: they hit smoother, but you did kind of
have to hit it like, yeah, there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain way you got to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, uh, it's very unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does, you know, it does what it needs
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does cool it a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use more water with the,
you tend to, the recyclers tend to have
[SPEAKER_01]: more water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why we only kept one recycler
in our line, uh, which is the mini one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't show a roll out of it right
now, but it's small, but because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: recycling action, we're able to put a lot
more water into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, if you didn't have the
recycling chamber, it would suck up the
[SPEAKER_01]: water through a mouthpiece, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just like a straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the recycling chamber kind of lets you
put more water and it separates the water
[SPEAKER_01]: and the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't get that splash of water in
your mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the water shoots back down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a big fan of recyclers for herb till
I got this ratchet, like the double
[SPEAKER_03]: ratchet one and that I was done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Oh my God, I've been leveled
up your mind, but we have ratchet
[SPEAKER_01]: recyclers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is like, these are easy to
clean too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was like another big part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's like, I like to have mine
always clean and all this is very easy to
[SPEAKER_03]: clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the ash catcher.
[SPEAKER_03]: And usually ash catchers are painting the
ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things we keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: We fucking hate dirty pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So making it easy to clean is part of the
functionality for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so jealous, Matt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I pray that one day I will get magic
to one of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Through the magic of TV.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a really, really cool dive into
the tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we, I don't know, I was wondering
if we want to come back to the timeline,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, where, what have you all been
doing in the last few years?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what was COVID like, you know,
what was, what have the last few years
[SPEAKER_05]: been like for you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's been kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: My father passed away seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was diagnosed with lung cancer and
unfortunately he didn't beat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of different things happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dynamics of the shop changed the whole
vibe of the place changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he was a, he was a very big presence
in both of our lives, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, well, the original spot we were
at, we moved in on a handshake.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't even really have information
on it until that landlord passed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause so many years are going by and
people are getting older, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and now a new company took it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted more rent.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't want us using propane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I can't use propane, I can't have
fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can't have fire, I can't make
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're kicking me out basically,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had to worry about moving to a
different place and dealing with all kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of things and the dynamics of the company
changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then COVID hit and it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good for a little while where
everybody had the stimulus money and they
[SPEAKER_01]: were spending it on this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The business was good, but then that all
changed and died out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had to actually stay relevant as
because we were essentially we were
[SPEAKER_01]: essential because there was a splitter
that was used for a ventilator thing for
[SPEAKER_01]: the hospital that we never actually got
into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried, but the logistics for that was
fucking ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of that one thing,
we're able to stay working when it was
[SPEAKER_01]: only essential workers only.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that kind of helped us stay
in business because otherwise we couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really go back and forth from work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it was a crazy time and like a
lot of things changed and we just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: took it as it came.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as living in Los Angeles,
and this is for me personally,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not speaking for Hamlet, but COVID had
to be one of the best times of my life
[SPEAKER_02]: because all of a sudden there was no
traffic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was living in Eugene again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have to see anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our business complex was empty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it reminded me of living in the
country again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a beautiful time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had more orders than you could possibly
imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were still working with the same people
that we work with and get to hang out with
[SPEAKER_02]: every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a, you know, a little somewhat
antisocial.
Same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, I didn't have to deal with all
the crazy people and all the traffic and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything about LA that I didn't like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're both kind of like hermit
crabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really like to do much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't blame you.
[SPEAKER_03]: LA does that to people though,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a very fast paced city and
everybody's so around each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're very antisocial real fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I am sitting.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just looks like exhausting to be out in
an environment like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of have to like find your peace,
you know, like for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And weed helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: What were you going to say about
Bakersfield?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like we were one of the few places
where COVID just didn't change anything
[SPEAKER_03]: because nobody like everybody here was
like, uh, that didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: This doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: So nothing changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like everybody was just out shopping.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you wear a mask?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: In LA, everyone would be masked up and
like hardly anyone's leaving their house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we drove to Idaho for a trip and
like maybe an hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the Bishop like an hour and a half
out of LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: We stopped at a store and it's like COVID
never has happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is like COVID death time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, wow, none of these people
are wearing masks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I went out to Alaska,
I was like, what the hell does it exist
[SPEAKER_01]: over here?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a whole different world.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were like a little Island in California
of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like Twilight Zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you wear a mask when you went out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got a lot of dirty looks.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a weird time for everyone.
Geez.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did affect some things like you know,
delivery of liquid oxygen and propane and
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, regular deliveries of glass coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, our glass comes from
Germany and it's broker to a different
[SPEAKER_01]: company that, that supplies us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a lot of issues with like
the shipping and the back backlog of ships
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a lot of issues with trying
to get everything because luckily we had
[SPEAKER_01]: enough of a backstop to kind of just work
through it and, and change up some designs
[SPEAKER_01]: and things to meet, uh, the sizing and
tubing that we have instead of what we can
[SPEAKER_02]: get, you know, and they did cancel shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was really nice too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had like a whole year almost of no
trade shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trade shows are brutal, brutal,
brutal, brutal.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't go to a certain kind of
person, we hate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't, we don't like doing the trade
shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to, and we do do them,
but we, I, I can't stand them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a small business owner, you have to
sell in order to make money.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be a salesman and just for
certain people, like for me, and I know
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys probably are the same where it's
just like, you have to force yourself to
[SPEAKER_03]: do things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't sell shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then eight hours a day of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've never been in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the trade shows, like we, you know,
we don't fit in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know that feeling.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that feeling must be a really
strange, must be a really strange
[SPEAKER_05]: performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, sometimes the old customers come
in and if they're cool, like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, let's sit, just smoke a bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk a little bit, like,
you know, whatever, you know, but when
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all like, you know, business sales
and just like putting up a front,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's that's annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, is there anything else that y'all
wanted to highlight about, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: your overall journey, especially recently?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause otherwise we can actually segue into
like more like open chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Michael, you had a few other kind
of like stories, anecdotes about strains
[SPEAKER_05]: that you encountered.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, but yeah, is there anything else y
'all wanted to say about recent years?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since you guys probably don't know a lot
about the, well, it seems like it would be
[SPEAKER_02]: apparent to me, but the early glass points
seen in Eugene, I can talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: about that and where I was fortunate and
maybe where I wasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: That first glass shop that I worked at was
called Advanced Glassworks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turned into Cascades.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was made glassworks and then turned
into Cornerstone Glassworks where it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like the DFO and all that stuff takes
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so there were a lot of
glassblowers coming through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had left.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I only worked at that shop for
maybe about seven months before I
[SPEAKER_02]: basically figured out I had basically my
best friend, little Chris that grew up
[SPEAKER_02]: with me there in Eugene.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were both working there and we looked
at it and we were like, hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we could buy these torches on our own and
all these supplies and just do this in our
[SPEAKER_02]: garage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty much what we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went out on our own.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had very limited knowledge at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got really lucky though, cause we ran
into a handful of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a guy named Matty that I was
friends with through a couple other
[SPEAKER_02]: glassblowers from that shop that would
teach us really cool, different
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to a hemp fest at Bill Condy's
place, which is in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be like a yearly gathering and
that's where I met Marcel and I asked him
[SPEAKER_02]: about teaching me techniques and he was
very generous with information and it kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of leapfrogged me to being able to support
myself without having to work for other
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I was really fortunate because
back then people really held the
[SPEAKER_02]: information tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't want to share any techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't want anyone stealing their
thunder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got real fortunate that those two groups
of people kind of taught me techniques
[SPEAKER_02]: that carried me all the way to California
and being able to start a small company on
[SPEAKER_02]: my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the guys that I originally learned
to blow glass with stalled out and quit
[SPEAKER_02]: because we didn't have the education that
Hamlet was able to get through his dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fortunate that he wanted to teach
me everything instead of trying to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go to class or you take
glassblowing studies or anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, there's a lot of information they
don't pass along because they don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: it to pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, they don't want it to get
to other people's hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to leave them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to keep the art to themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with me, it was the other way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to teach me everything he knew
and I was fortunate in that aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like people with clones in the weed
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how in certain groups you don't pass
the clones to some that don't pass it to
[SPEAKER_03]: that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there'd be like trade baiting type of
things going on where I'd run into someone
[SPEAKER_02]: that would tell you how to incorrectly do
a technique so that they could blow you
[SPEAKER_02]: off that path, similar to, hey,
this is Chem D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ain't Chem D.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be a simple little tips and tricks
that are part of the trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless they tell you, you watch it,
you might not even catch it because it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: split second of what happened that you
didn't see because very minute things in
[SPEAKER_01]: glassblowing make a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, if people get the things to
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and uh, thousand, I know this
may be a little less to do with,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, the glass, but I wouldn't mind talking
about some of the herb that I saw go
[SPEAKER_02]: through those shops between, uh,
yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Baker design.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're ready for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because, um, obviously I've,
I've heard not so talk about some of them
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of that information he gets from
guys that I blew glass with and they were
[SPEAKER_02]: real close friends of mine in Eugene,
you know, um, there's so many strange from
[SPEAKER_03]: Eugene, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glass blowing circles in Eugene,
you know, uh, before the Bubba cushions
[SPEAKER_02]: and the OG cushions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never seen those in, in Oregon,
at least at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, I do remember very early on,
I'd say 96, 97, we started seeing a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, not DJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Matt might disagree with this,
but they weren't DJ short blueberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't disagree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to be their stories of I've seen
so many seeds popped from DJ and I just
[SPEAKER_02]: never saw the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were getting past.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it had a really, really distinct
nose on it and it had a spicy pure
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry fruit jam taste to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had real crimson hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were just little round nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, the Trinity, I remember the
first time that came through super early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's not the ones I wanted to hear
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know not so, and I have different
descriptions of what we get from it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think some of that has to do with
what we think a skunk is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he he's mentioned the Trinity being
really skunky to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't really skunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: That had more of like a soft pillowy sour
skunk to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas we used to get a strain in Eugene
called the mud bud or the Afghani tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was long spears.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really, really dark green with
orange hairs and it smelled like dead
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk for a long ways away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the skunkiest thing we ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I, I don't know if it's the same
kind of super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guys that have had it in Oregon were
bikers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it was the skunkiest weed we had
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if it's an Afghani tie,
if, if they got that right, it wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_03]: a super skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds awesome though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I think there's skunky weed way
outside of super skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think what super skunk has is some
of the best and most accessible versions
[SPEAKER_03]: of it that we have, but there's gotta be
like a lot more out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This pure Afghanis and different things
and different hybrids from different eras
[SPEAKER_02]: that are like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't experienced what you know
for a hundred percent is super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it was from where I'm sitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'd see super skunk and be like,
Oh my God, that's even skunkier than that
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but from my experience,
that was the skunkiest thing I had seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we used to get amazing AK 47 at that
shop, just big pillowy pretty buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember the scent on the AK 47 you
guys saw?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I thought it smelled like sandalwood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys got the sandal woody type.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard of that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a really lovely spicy woody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I I've never seen the cherry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where it came from,
who had it, but it just ended up at the
[SPEAKER_01]: shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you like it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the white widow that I experienced
back then, it was frostiest, like just
[SPEAKER_01]: snow covered looking buds I've ever seen
in my life and it tasted amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I don't know where or where it
originated or who had it what,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like I said, it ended up at the shop
and the chocolate tie too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was random.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was from an old veteran buddy of mine
that had, he just randomly came up with
[SPEAKER_01]: some chocolate ties.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy, I know you never smoked this
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I looked into it more and I was
more and more amazed by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the Trinity, I have to agree with you,
like, but there is questions about like
[SPEAKER_03]: whether the Trinity cut that we have now
is the same as the old Trinity cut,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, but the one that we have now
that people say, and they smell,
[SPEAKER_03]: smell skunky to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't smell skunky.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells musty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's about the best I can get.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's musty.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd agree with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I just leave it there because I
can't, my nose can't develop it much more,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's not skunky as I would qualify it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one I remember wasn't either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when the snow first came into
Eugene about that same time that the
[SPEAKER_02]: Trinity did, that one was excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we used to get a Korean skunk there in
Eugene and I can't remember if that was
[SPEAKER_02]: from Amos or if that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gotta be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember if it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it probably was.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the only person I've ever seen have a
Korean skunk ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made its way through Eugene.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a really spicy purple haired nice
little frosty buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to experience that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's like a backbone of a lot of his
lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite out of all of them was that
Quimby.
[SPEAKER_02]: When that Quimby came into the shop the
first time, it was one of the most
[SPEAKER_02]: impressive strains I had ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nose was just so unique and it smelled
so strong and it wasn't skunk strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more of, uh, just, I don't know,
like some kind of candied, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: candy dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to describe it,
but, um, some of those old school stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that I can remember to this, when,
when I get something today and it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's this or that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I don't remember it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it smelled different to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, you know, and I can never almost,
I can never find it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's, it's pretty common because
like a lot of people didn't keep those
[SPEAKER_03]: same old cuts and you know, they just
didn't stay popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes they get a second wind and
people just try to capitalize on the name
[SPEAKER_03]: and don't have access to those groups with
those cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: They kept them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So few people do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I just repeated a whole not so
statement right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have just inserted him.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we used to get some really nice
Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, uh, not, I mean, we would get
Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number five too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also that was super boring, but we would
get like a dank dark green Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, those are the strains that I really
remember like circulating heavily in those
[SPEAKER_02]: shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we would always have access to one of
those and they were always good.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few others.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't remember the name of anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a couple hash plants that had
special names, but that was when I came to
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your, you said, hold on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said Amos.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just realized most people have no
idea who you're talking about or who we're
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're referring to Soma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amos Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and what you were talking about is
the backbone, I think to lavender and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, did you have a lot of experience with
him there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever have runnings with him?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever see him in there or any of
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta remember, um, we were pretty
young.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm laying into him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was probably 15 years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, he was well known for,
uh, dry sifting his bag, but you got him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you could go and get weed from Amos
and, uh, you'd look at it and it's still,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was still good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't really know any better to be
honest with you, but what you could be
[SPEAKER_02]: guaranteed is that Amos would load you a
bong head of about the best sift you could
[SPEAKER_02]: ever imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you just paid for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and the reason his buds were
always a very uniform roundness to them in
[SPEAKER_02]: the same size, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look like bags of like little
marbles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but, um, but he did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard that story before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had great weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a, you know, Eugene had a lot of
those weird older hippie characters in it
[SPEAKER_02]: that every once in a while take advantage
of younger kids, you know, in one way or
[SPEAKER_02]: another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I remember there was this guy I got
introduced to named Michael Golden and he
[SPEAKER_02]: swore up and down that Eagle Bill stole
his design for the vaporizer at the High
[SPEAKER_02]: Times Cannabis Cup and would just get so
angry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and, uh, he was the first one I
saw with that heat gun and then it was a
[SPEAKER_02]: real vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, what he had that really impressed
me, Matt, was he had about 20 packs of
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and this was, okay, I was probably
17 at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this had to be like 94, maybe 95.
[SPEAKER_02]: 94.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, he had these packs of seeds that
were from Corvallis, Oregon with this
[SPEAKER_02]: really cool beaver logo on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he would tell me, like, each one of
these varieties and they were created,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, early 80s and he's been holding onto
them forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was like the first time I ever
really saw packaged seeds that were
[SPEAKER_02]: American and not Canadian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who was this guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: His name was Michael Golden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the guys from, uh, God, it's not
Pharmacy Factory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, what's the name of that elephant logo?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Honeysuckle Lotus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys, they're from, uh, Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're from Oregon, but they live
in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: They introduced me to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know if we were selling him
weed or we were buying weed from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he was the guy that swore up and down
that Eagle Bill stole his design for the
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporizer and Eagle Bill had won a
Cannabis Cup with his design.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know a guy named Petrie?
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe Petrie?
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe Petrie?
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe Petrie?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's familiar.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a book, I think, called The King of
Nepal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't recall the name.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: He sounds like a very similar character.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just wondering.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a very similar character.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, fellas, it's been fun,
but unfortunately I have to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been great having you, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate you being on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you guys, you guys get the full
Michael now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't screw it up, Michael.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a couple of points,
Michael, that you wanted to touch on that
[SPEAKER_05]: we discussed yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: One was your first year in California and
the other one was Josh D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one did we go with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know, it was, it was not
necessarily just Josh D.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my experience with getting
introduced to Californian weed because,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, what a lot of my friends nowadays have
a hard time believing is that,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, this is kind of off topic thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But every once in a while during harvest
season in Oregon, guys would bring up weed
[SPEAKER_02]: from Humboldt that was outdoor and it was
so fucking good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone always had this thing where,
oh, outdoors, mids, you know, it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: that great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indoor is like the holy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember getting outdoor weed that was
so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: From some of those kids that it rivaled
any indoor I'd ever had, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, even Hamlet, I've had this argue
with them a million times where he's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen good outdoor weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling him, it just doesn't get here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know the right people here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you, do you disagree, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have much experience with it,
so I can't speak on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I want to say, I haven't seen it
because I haven't, but I also,
[SPEAKER_03]: I also didn't live in an epicenter where
like a bunch of outdoor was shipped.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had shitty brick weed growing up and
then we had everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I never saw a brick of weed until I
moved to California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, we had that growing up and that's all
we had.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, you know, trying to call outdoor
shitty compared to that is kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I remember some of the outdoor
means so good, but, um, so right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before Y2K, I got moved from Eugene,
Oregon, uh, down to Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had been in a situation in Eugene where,
um, my glass shop was in my house and I
[SPEAKER_02]: had come home from, I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have been in a girlfriends are out
hiking with my dogs, but I pulled up to my
[SPEAKER_02]: house and there was three undercover cars
and a bunch of cops in my house and I
[SPEAKER_02]: pulled up and I asked one of the officers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my house and they tried to tell me
that, um, they had chased a suspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had jumped over the fence and they
thought he went into my house and so,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, I walk in my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all in my living room.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in my little glass shop and I'm
like, so I'm assuming the guys are here
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, they start asking me all sorts of
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what's going in the glass shop?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, uh, what's all, what are these
gases for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, this isn't for cooking, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, no, no, no, I don't know
anything about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, at the end they, you know,
basically fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing there for them other than,
you know, some glass pipes, which in
[SPEAKER_02]: Eugene isn't a big deal and, uh,
they leave and I call the police
[SPEAKER_02]: department and I start asking questions
and they tell me that they never had any
[SPEAKER_02]: officers in my area that night.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next day I go down to the fifth
street market and I talked to,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, a lawyer that was always at the hemp
vest, you know, and I asked him to look
[SPEAKER_02]: into it and he makes some calls.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave him like $200 retainer and,
uh, he told me, um, at this point they're
[SPEAKER_02]: telling him that this never happened,
that I'm imagining that they never had any
[SPEAKER_02]: officers in the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his personal recommendation to me
would be to move somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I told him, you know,
I, I don't really have too much illegal
[SPEAKER_02]: involvement other than the glass blowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just told me, you know,
for my own safety, maybe it'd be better if
[SPEAKER_02]: I did move.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I started talking to my distributor
down in California and they offered to
[SPEAKER_02]: move me down there to start a glass
blowing company.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would give me the money and a place
to live and set me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the guys that did that own a chain of
stores in Los Angeles called, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: dementia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the time they owned roar and later
that became, uh, heavy glass and Sheldon
[SPEAKER_02]: black.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they moved me down and, uh,
the guy that is kind of coordinating all
[SPEAKER_02]: this is the manager for all the head shops
and he's lived in the San Fernando Valley
[SPEAKER_02]: his whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's real, real connected.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I was fortunate in that way
because I was worried about coming down to
[SPEAKER_02]: LA and not be able to get herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is before they had stores,
you know, so I moved down to LA and the
[SPEAKER_02]: first thing he does is he introduces me
to, uh, a guy named Joel, OG glass who,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, had grown up in Reseda.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was real, uh, connected to,
and he was probably one of maybe 10 glass
[SPEAKER_02]: blowers that were known down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what was really cool about that was
he was real connected with Oregon kid,
[SPEAKER_02]: with Josh D with all these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So within the first few months of me
living in LA, I was able to buy my first
[SPEAKER_02]: bag from Oregon kid, which was above a
Kush for 450.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hadn't, I hadn't seen anything with
that particular smell and taste in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was really expecting to come down to
California and think, especially in Los
[SPEAKER_02]: Angeles and think they didn't have
anything to offer me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had already lived in the pinnacle of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was without knowing I had grown up in
the pinnacle of berry marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where all the berries are coming from.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, few weeks, maybe after that Bubba
Kush, I, uh, got to go over to Josh D's
[SPEAKER_02]: house with Joel handed over 500 bucks for
my first mason jar of OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That jar of OG with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think at the time he was a photographer
and, uh, it was one of the most amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: things I'd ever smelled.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I definitely haven't ever smelled any
weed like this before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a golden color.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't like a dark green or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a nice cured brownish gold and
it was just fucking fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a hard time recalling ever seeing
OG grown or looking and smelling that
[SPEAKER_02]: great as I did from Josh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that first month I also got introduced
to a couple of guys in Hollywood and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's where I first saw the tangerine and
their big bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what they called the NorCal big bud
was, uh, not like the Amsterdam big bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was like a pure sweet skunk big bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: The buds weren't big.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, you know, like they, they weren't
like huge colas like I'd expect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just another misnomer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yielded huge, he said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the pull of that big bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: But his tangerine was again, one of the
most unique things I'd ever smelled in
[SPEAKER_02]: weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that tangerine like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, pure, pure tangerine juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not what tangy it's tangy has nothing
to do with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tangy is gross in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tangerine was gifted to Oregon kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right after my friend got busted and um,
we basically all closed down shop and
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't want to lose it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it's my favorite weed I've ever
had.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been that tangerine and uh,
he got it and changed the name to skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: tangerine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skunk tangerine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think of what I have with
that in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you can find it on, um, certain
unreputable clone dealers menus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon kid shared it with them with the
promise that it wouldn't be let out,
[SPEAKER_02]: which of course this guy who you've had
running, running, I'm sure now sells it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But um, it's a 12 to 13 week sativa that
doesn't get too tall, but it yields great
[SPEAKER_02]: and it grows bats like just huge arm
length colas of some of the most
[SPEAKER_02]: smelliest, beautiful fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it puts tangy to shame,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I like a good orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a good sweet orange myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it smells like sunkist orange juice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not like tangy cause it's,
it's never smelled like that to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's like an orange rind or
gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super muted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's almost like maybe a descendant or
a bag seed from that original tangerine or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that, but it's not the
same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've seen Mean Gene comment about
him seeing it before and it having huge
[SPEAKER_02]: bats, but I know the name was changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was never skunked tangerine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a little bit of a tangent, but also
just to add some context.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you like smoking these days?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wonder if you could actually answer
that for Hamlet as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you knew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hamlet loves Quimby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quimby is an old Oregon strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: No idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: No idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: No idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I lived in Eugene, when the dead tour
ended, there was like an influx of people
[SPEAKER_02]: that left the tour and moved to Eugene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Quimby came around that same time that
all those hippies and the heroin and all
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff came to Eugene when the tour
ended.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there was positive and negatives
when the tour ended.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot more drugs, but a lot of
new strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quimby was one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just real, real unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't know how else to describe
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know not so has experience with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I think JD or one of them used it
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whitaker blues.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it's in my memory bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does he still smoke that today?
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's his favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the pure Quimby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that was, I think DJ had a
vanilla Kush.
Any?
[SPEAKER_02]: Vanilluna.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a male from that was used to pollinate
the Quimby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Fino was found that's real,
real close to that original in Hamlet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's as best as I can get for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about you yourself?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you like smoking these days?
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like not so sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't give me, as I get older,
my likelihood of having panic attacks,
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking potent weed has gone through the
roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's certain things that I joke about
it, but if I smoke certain things,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be in the bathtub with my
wife ensuring me that I'm going to be okay
[SPEAKER_02]: for an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the reality of my situation now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish more males our age in our age group
would talk about it because I think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: way more common than anybody realizes to
have these fucking major panic attacks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I dab all day long and I smoke
flour interchangeably, but there's times
[SPEAKER_03]: when flour will just set me off in a
totally different direction and spin me
[SPEAKER_03]: out and just give me a panic attack.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't happen when I was young,
but I don't know if hormonally as we get
[SPEAKER_03]: older, some of us, it just affects us much
more different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm almost 100% positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have more things to worry about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hormonal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we do have more things to worry
about as adults too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's hormonal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I feel like there are some strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I smoke Urkel, I'm in the bathtub.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with me, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it's just a little bit,
I'll be in the bathtub.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely relaxed me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Made me feel a lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pineapple fields from dynasty has a
real nice put me in a happy place effect
[SPEAKER_02]: for me, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some riot berry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting ready to try.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping that that does it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blueberries make me feel real,
real good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping that it's been so long since
I've had blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping it can do the same for me
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope because mine descends from DJ's
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that just having the same scent
expression brings back some of those same,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, however they combine,
however the cannabinoids combine or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that anything that typically has
DJ's blueberry in it, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrid or full, whether it's blueberry
scented or not, usually it's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually if it has a blueberry scent,
it's totally anti-anxiety for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like you have a very similar
body chemistry or brain chemistry to me
[SPEAKER_03]: when it comes to strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people look at me really weird when
they talk about it like a pussy,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked your one suggestion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard you say on one of the shows where
you were like, I just smoke so much so
[SPEAKER_02]: that my tolerance doesn't get low enough
to where it affects me that way as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the only thing I can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had a little more free time where I could
experiment with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what really helped me was when I
learned about dabbing and shit because
[SPEAKER_03]: dabbing just doesn't hit me that way ever
because for me it's always the same
[SPEAKER_03]: effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's real boring, but it raised my
tolerance for THC up so high that usually
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get that, but still even dabbing
diamonds all day, it'll happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll happen and it's real weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to think it was all THC related,
but if I'm flooding myself with THC and it
[SPEAKER_03]: still happens only with flour on odd
occasions, I just don't know what causes
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, Urkel and Bubba are the
two biggest and it's funny because I hear
[SPEAKER_02]: people say that shit is not potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't get them as low highs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if I smoke Urkel or Bubba,
I'm running for the hills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's necessarily potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think that it hits us in such a
strange way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not about potency.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just about what the fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fear is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, but I think I'll definitely be
getting to try a lot more things this
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, now that we're lucky enough to
be able to have, you know, such great
[SPEAKER_02]: freedoms in California where we can have
six whole plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Experiment with trying some, some of the
new stuff, some of the old stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like to remind you, what are you
interested in?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, for herb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what, what do you think you might be
interested in, in running that you haven't
[SPEAKER_05]: run before?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a thousand, what I'm most
interested in and excited for is popping
[SPEAKER_02]: beans that are made by people that I can
feel good about supporting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's enough people in this
industry at this point that can get lucky
[SPEAKER_02]: or pick a male to pollinate a bunch of
clones with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a ton of good seeds and like at
this point, it'd probably be hard to find
[SPEAKER_02]: bad seeds unless you're buying from one of
the big companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do get excited about is being able to
participate in people that I really know
[SPEAKER_02]: have a valid story and a valid love of the
plant and are breeding for specific
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I love trace dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to cross it with this other
thing that I really love and hopefully it
[SPEAKER_02]: passes on this instead of just guys that
say, um, I've got great gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to S one it onto every
single cookie and it's going to be stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I'm sure all those things
they could have marvelous plants in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to support guys that are
breeding and on a mission, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of be able to follow those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'd call them stories or
not, but I want to follow their
[SPEAKER_02]: theoretical ideas and see if they match up
and see if I can experience those same
[SPEAKER_02]: things that they experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think I go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, I just think that like one
important aspect of this is connection and
[SPEAKER_05]: feeling like in growing someone's work,
you are connected to them, their projects,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, um, a wider community aspect.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got you with an aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that's one of the really
cool things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of the really cool things
about reader syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's one of the really cool
things about reader syndicate is um I can
[SPEAKER_02]: feel really good about throwing my support
towards certain people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because uh like back in the day,
Gypsy Nirvana, I don't want to throw my
[SPEAKER_02]: money at guys that go overseas to have sex
with little girls like that is gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want my money going there.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first I ever bought were from Dark
Enemy and yeah, I grew some great NL skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: Mighty Might.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The smells were unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was happy but you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need my money going into the
pocket of some **** crazy right wing
[SPEAKER_02]: person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like why am I going to support
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to support guys that jet set
all over the world and wear big gold
[SPEAKER_02]: necklaces and play these games when I know
back in Oregon, the people that actually
[SPEAKER_02]: know them know they've never grown any
**** Yeah, they can text the plants ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's very common and then I meet
people down here and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: whoa, you know, they have these facilities
down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, wow, what are you doing in here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're making a ton of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what's your seed company?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, we make it for this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, whoa, that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy's I was like, does he make the
choices?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because this is my experience of a
lot of the industry, especially before I
[SPEAKER_05]: came to the breeder syndicate like
everything's really like faceless,
[SPEAKER_05]: lifeless, soulless, alienated,
isolated.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like nothing seemed nothing felt
real until I found, you know, some of some
[SPEAKER_05]: of these guys here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, like I want to be excited
about genuine people that care about the
[SPEAKER_02]: things that I care about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, even if my garden is only six
plants, it's what brings me happiness at
[SPEAKER_02]: the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's it's not a freedom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just what they're allowing us
basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's what brings me back to a
time in my life when I was super free and
[SPEAKER_02]: I was more concerned with myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: More concerned with just happiness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so if I can get in with guys
like H and L and pack and Matt and god,
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at some point, you know, and follow
their journeys of what they experience and
[SPEAKER_02]: what their favorite things are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to share a little piece of their
life and we can share it with each other.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I feel that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even being all the way out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been it's been a real joy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know we're gonna have to drag him
out one day all the way from whatever he's
[SPEAKER_03]: from Australia or somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where the accents from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, to be more specific, I look
forward to popping some high and lonesome
[SPEAKER_02]: this year.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got done popping some Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna pop some some goat, some goat
farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: High and lonesome's got a a new green
craft BX coming out real soon too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna I'm gonna go with the stoned
ape.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone else pop it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get some feedback on that puppy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I became to see that for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I generally I'm real narrow in my seat by
at this point in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't going towards Matt or CSI.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: High and lonesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, dynasty's the only one that I've
really messed with outside of that and
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been happy with.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got good stuff too.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got he's got a good eye for male
sativas.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a beautiful have you ever seen
his pictures?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's always been that way, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like back in the forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a photographer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember what sub cool used to rip it up
like all the photographers sub cool would
[SPEAKER_03]: just he was one of the best when it came
to taking pictures of beautiful plants
[SPEAKER_03]: that no one did it better.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I remember dynasty got on his site and
was taking pictures and he him and this
[SPEAKER_03]: dude Oh Cannabis were just stepping it up
level after level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, dude, he's made a good name for
himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been around a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been around for a long time and he's
kept his his strains unique and his own
[SPEAKER_03]: identity and I appreciate that a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what, Matt?
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of everything I pop from him,
it's look like those pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's and that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's important, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, you're getting what he
tells you you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that's that's a part of the art
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say, you know, like when you can
deliver on something and say this this
[SPEAKER_03]: thing that I haven't popped myself,
I have I've worked with this enough that I
[SPEAKER_03]: can predict how this is going to the
outcome of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and I can show you these pictures,
but I can ensure you it's going to look
[SPEAKER_03]: like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something special.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of that's been missing for a
long time, especially when it's not just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, kush mints by whatever clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're a big seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you're going to know it's going
to look like kush mints.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I I like the unique stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was doing like I was I've been,
you know, like doing strain reviews lately
[SPEAKER_03]: and like looking at the new strains
because I don't know shit about new
[SPEAKER_03]: strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I probably should because of the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was looking up these different ones
like Blue Zushi and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't realize this because because
of their names.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously, I should be you shouldn't
shock me or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was no blueberry in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no there's nothing called
Zushi.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a kush mints.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a kush mints.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what?
[SPEAKER_03]: That kush mints.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gittles has been done for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still pushing this, but just get a
new name again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Breeder of the Year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Magic, magic, magic, magic.
[SPEAKER_03]: How they do it every time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Breeder of the Year, Apples and Bananas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All super unique.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was funny is that there's a
dude named Dirt Farmer Genetics that had
[SPEAKER_03]: just released an Apples and Bananas that
year, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I got run over by compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not even his release.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't I think I know who made that,
but I don't want to say because they
[SPEAKER_03]: probably don't want people to know they
made it for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, but he'll he'll happily take credit
and extra necklace.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll take that, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: He likes them Rolexes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could go on for hours and hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, we are we are coming up on
the two hour mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, are there any other things
that you two wanted to?
[SPEAKER_05]: Touch on before we wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything specific you had?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thousand or me, you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think I got a lot of that out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wish I had more for you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, are you are you guys still in
touch with Ken today?
[SPEAKER_03]: Organ Kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came down last Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was last Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was last Christmas and hung out for a
few hours in the shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, I'm I haven't talked to
him except for a few messages on
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Asking, you know, when can we hook back up
and trade or whatever?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a fascinating part of the OG
story.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's always interesting when
people meet him early on and have their
[SPEAKER_03]: impressions and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he he was a real sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: He he well, no, he still is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why his thing was.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hasn't changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a sweet guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's through a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's one of those guys that was real early
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my eyes got taken advantage of like
crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like he he had some physical
limitations but he should still he's
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty talented with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you know this but he's
bred some really cool **** Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh and he should still be you know,
in everybody's mouth like doing cool ****
[SPEAKER_02]: like a lot of these guys do and he's not
for whatever reason and I don't know if
[SPEAKER_02]: that's personal choices he's made or just
the fact that people are going to take
[SPEAKER_02]: advantage of you if you put yourself in
situations to get taken advantage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take advantage.
[SPEAKER_03]: I I've I've attributed most of my like
early career to him and and kept him going
[SPEAKER_03]: like that because I thought like because I
I did so much with the banana OG like it
[SPEAKER_03]: was such an important part of what people
attributed to me and even Bubba because he
[SPEAKER_03]: had he played such a major part with that,
you know, and yeah, I think he deserves a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot more credit than he gets to and it's a
shame because he was an important part of
[SPEAKER_03]: all that for a lot of us, a lot of us and
banana OG still being used out the wazoo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you imagine if he hadn't paid that
money for the OG Kush clone from Josh?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would happen with OG Kush?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have been locked down so much
further for longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like that thing was hard to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: He made that accessible for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should all be thankful just like the
chems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were made accessible forever but they
were and we were fortunate to have them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether we like the guys that had them or
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't quite matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that they're still available in
the game.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even that Bubba Kush bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That thing was **** amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm real amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I never got the coffee stuff
from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine was always more lime but it was
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of different ways you can
grow Bubba and it's one of those plants
[SPEAKER_03]: where like II can get it earthy coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can get it almost chocolatey.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can get it soapy, cushy, you know,
and you can get lime out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a lot in Bubba depending
on how you grow it and the S ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of variation too.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's there's all lemon phenos in the S
ones that show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm looking forward to someday
popping a bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I think CSI just CSI just popped
another 100 or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think just to run through him to see
what's in there again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: CSI.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I had that much space, man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these guys are living our dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, every once in a while,
I'll get hit up, you know, by a younger
[SPEAKER_02]: guy and they're just like, oh bro,
the glass thing is so awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it's like uh I got into
glass because I love weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Roller coaster so that I can continue on
into weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cuz I've I've never been great
at being social.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I I could do the glass blowing and get
in the circles I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've been in the circles for a
while and it's out for me but I'd rather
[SPEAKER_02]: live uh Caleb's dream than this dream,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, like I'm so fascinated by
different art like and I've done the seed
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff for so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be more into the glass thing now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be like, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to learn a whole new trade as opposed
to more seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: More seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, if I, if I was doing it at
a CSI level, it'd be a different story
[SPEAKER_03]: though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuz like that much space, you options.
[SPEAKER_03]: Run through s to be able to see things
always.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I shouldn't been the most inclusive
big projects with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I just take it for granted.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a mentor is showing done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's crazy to see that and to get ins
and then he spends time with though.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he works hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah it again soon on the, on the episode
here soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we need to start beating
everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I just want to such a cool
conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: L such a, such a neat overview as well on
like the glass scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, from like Bob's not grass,
Eugene operation pipe dreams, science
[SPEAKER_05]: glass, um, import glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we basically got all these lovely
milestones from you too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and I think anyone from anywhere
wanting to learn about at least,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, uh, get an idea of the history
of glass pipes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this has been such a great
conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we could probably take it,
you know, if you ever wanted to,
[SPEAKER_03]: cause we barely touched on each one of
those things in brief segments.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's anything you want to expand
on, and if anybody has any questions about
[SPEAKER_03]: anything they heard in this episode,
let us know, give us feedback and we'd
[SPEAKER_03]: love to have them back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a really fun one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I just sat here and learned,
I kind of stayed shut up and just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, cause this is formative for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I suspect that this is not the last time
we will see Michael.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spindle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime there's anything you guys want to
ask, feel free.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's anything you feel like I didn't
cover well enough and you have more
[SPEAKER_02]: questions thousand, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I covered this well
enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, this is some of the glass here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And realistically, like when we met up and
I tried it, like I know bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: These became my only pieces, not because
like this had this didn't even been talked
[SPEAKER_03]: about or exist became my, my favorite
pieces because of function.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why we even started talking and
you started talking to me because you love
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking strains and weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just kind of dorked out together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, it's been really amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, there's only a few times
in life when you get leveled up on
[SPEAKER_03]: something that you love.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I felt like I got leveled up in,
in smoking functionality with you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quickest from point A to B.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all it takes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You avoid veering off into that bullshit
sea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I love it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I think if, if you're trying to
wrap it up thousand, there's a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: things I wanted to go over for anybody
that might be younger in the audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we still have some number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, do not this older generation of seed
makers, these guys in their late thirties
[SPEAKER_02]: to forties to fifties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't build them up into something they're
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't follow people blindly and fight for
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know what they're about,
they're just guys making seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy what they do, enjoy their seeds,
but don't build people up because you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be constantly, constantly torn
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to bum you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, two glass boy is one of the last
American handmade industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's not a lot of things that
you can buy in America anymore that is
[SPEAKER_02]: made by Americans and glass is one of
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to be see to support
American glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a big enough price difference
to throw your money at some sweatshop.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not taking care of its people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, three for the younger generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people, uh, are hurting
and they're not going to have money to
[SPEAKER_02]: travel around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very fortunate young.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to go to Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's a thing I found in France
called a bidet younger generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that it's not manly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spray water on your ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the fact that no one wants to shake
hands with someone whose ass was only a
[SPEAKER_02]: small hand was only a small tissue between
your ass and your shit and your handshake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bidet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love a friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to say that if someone
walked to you and smeared shit on your
[SPEAKER_02]: arm, would you be comfortable using a
handful of paper towels and just wiping
[SPEAKER_02]: that clean and then going about your
business?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you would.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never.
Never.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you would.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been lucky enough to go to Japan a
couple of times and I gotta say,
[SPEAKER_05]: I do love the bidet now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a small upgrade for your house.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to be tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like 30 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 bucks on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be clean the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's stop this pandemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be something shit related.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be and it could be because you're
not using bidets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And realistically, it feels much better
when you walk around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want an itchy asshole.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, nobody likes that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody likes that, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stinky fingers suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is definitely how I envisioned us
concluding this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to leave something for the younger
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be able to share some of my
experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hygiene grooming tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was life changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it was for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not lying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't idolize.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't pedestal and also clean your butt
properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And buy American.
[SPEAKER_05]: Buy American.
[SPEAKER_05]: And buy American.
[SPEAKER_05]: For glass.
Yeah.
Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I really appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you to Hamlet as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess that's it from Breeders
Syndicate.

[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Daily lifestyle sometimes, but it's a nice
community of great people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, check that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll add one little thing here,
which is that people who have been asking
[SPEAKER_05]: about Notso, you could join the Discord
and you get to talk to Notso.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's actually really responsive on Discord
and he hands out quite a lot.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

we're not at 10,000 subscribers yet,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can jump on the Discord and talk to
him.

these guys make themselves so accessible
[SPEAKER_02]: on that Discord.

everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all just a bunch of dorks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we'd be doing this anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you'd just be doing this anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the greatest deal in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to really get details about the
seeds you're buying from people that bred
[SPEAKER_02]: them and grew them out and tested them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a 40% discount on American
made glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and you get to basically commune
with a bunch of people that have the same
[SPEAKER_02]: exact interests as you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's not trolls.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really weird community.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like Instagram or Twitter or just
people sniping at each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never had anyone be fucky to me on
the Discord ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it happened, it would just be
self-policed.
[SPEAKER_03]: People take care of themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So get in there before I convince Matt to
raise the monthly subscription fee.
