[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_03]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_03]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_03]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_03]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_03]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am your host, Thousandfold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly today, we were meant to have Matt,
but something came up last minute for him,
[SPEAKER_04]: so we will be running the show without
Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: As an aside, I can only imagine that he's
not too disappointed to miss growing
[SPEAKER_04]: roundtables.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's expressed his indifference before,
but it's always fun to have him,
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's sad that we don't get him tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope he is doing okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, we welcome back Skristen,
Scarecrow, and Kyle from the previous
[SPEAKER_04]: Growers Roundtable, but for the first
time, we welcome Bumcat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this show tonight is actually going to
be about organic growing, and I wanted to
[SPEAKER_04]: state a qualifier here, which is that
organic growers, maybe somewhat
[SPEAKER_04]: ironically, tend to be some of the most
tribal dogmatic, scary people in the
[SPEAKER_04]: community.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not here to be, you know,
the people on this panel are not here to
[SPEAKER_04]: be authorities.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just here as growers sharing their
thoughts, sharing their experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: So unclench your fists, put your knives
away, take your hands off the keyboard,
[SPEAKER_04]: and just try to enjoy the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your opinions differ, feel free to
comment later on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so maybe since Bumcat is new to this
show, I want to invite him to speak on a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I'll get him to repeat,
because he told us a bit about this before
[SPEAKER_04]: we hit record, is what his recent,
you know, what his current growing
[SPEAKER_04]: situation is like, and secondarily,
why he wanted to do the show in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bumcat, do you want to tell us about what
you've been growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: You told us a bit about your situation
moving just before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I just ended up moving up to the
Rockies around 9,000 feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the last two years, I've been growing
in an apartment down in the Denver area.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was growing in a two by four,
which is a 300 watt light, just really
[SPEAKER_05]: small, really confined space to do my
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now I have a little bit more space up
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did just harvest last May,
a round of Trinity Bubba Kush from Two
[SPEAKER_05]: Dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had five potential keepers that
moved on to the second round.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them didn't end up cloning.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's down to four now that are going to
get moved on to the second round.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as for the second part,
I wanted to do the show mainly because I
[SPEAKER_05]: feel like it's a because you've said,
and many others will point out that
[SPEAKER_05]: organic growers are really tribal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really hard to find a good
discussion, in my opinion, where people
[SPEAKER_05]: can actually be fair and not be overly
biased to one side.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I kind of wanted to have this
conversation more just on the grounds of
[SPEAKER_05]: being able to actually talk about these
ideas and share these ideas with others,
[SPEAKER_05]: because I feel like going organically is
kind of pitfalled.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of hard ways to find
information.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like we between three of us can
really guide some people and help provide
[SPEAKER_05]: some information and helpful tips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you so much as well for
initiating all of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you spoke to me about this like a
year ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took us a little bit to get to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think once we I think once we knew
we could get Scrooge and Kyle as well,
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of forgot that we had more people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that we have more organic growers,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just took me a little bit to kind of
like think of who might fit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I appreciate all of you being
here again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Bumcat, last question for you is how
long have you been growing and how long
[SPEAKER_04]: have you been growing organic?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a little bit of a mixed career.
[SPEAKER_05]: I started in organics and I've grown
everything at home.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been organics.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the last two years, almost two years,
it'll be two in September.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've worked for an MSO here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll keep the company name for later for
you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, I've actually really enjoyed
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kind of call it it's weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: I call it a mom and pop MSO because the
owner is like an old forum head who ended
[SPEAKER_05]: up getting some funding from some friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's a really good guy and really
loves and like has a passion for genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a lot of it's a lot of fun for me
to be able to like bounce ideas off him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's been growing for 30 something
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I personally have been growing since
2019.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really like to count that first
year because it was so, so horrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can get to that one later.
[SPEAKER_05]: But everything that I've done,
which the first two years were outdoors,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then I bought a tent and really fucked
that first round up as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I've just kind of slowly learned
everything I could from resources from
[SPEAKER_05]: Build a Soil YouTube channel to Jeff
Lowenfeld's Teaming With series and all
[SPEAKER_05]: sorts of other podcasts that I can go on
and on about it later.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, that's kind of where I've been
at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kyle and Skustin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe start with Kyle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, you guys have been on the show
before.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, just as an icebreaker warm up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe tell us again about what you've been
growing recently and your setup and style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for having me again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do TLO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly it's the rev.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it's kind of all his stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's TLO.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everybody thinks it's like a kind of
it's one one thing, but it's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do different kind of tenets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Styles within that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I just kind of do that and I
kind of mix it around just based on what's
[SPEAKER_02]: going on at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I'm going in the garage,
my environment changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just kind of I'm always kind of doing
different stuff right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have see I got some Santa Cruz wreck,
some Blue Dream S1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what else do I have in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's oh, I got some this is
Black Poison from the rev growing in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to do some reversal stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kind of playing around doing a
whole bunch of different things,
actually.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too much from the last episode,
really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just same old, same old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just keep it chugging along.
[SPEAKER_04]: One question I had for you was how much
how much experience you have with
[SPEAKER_04]: synthetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I only know from seeing other girls
and that's my experience mostly from my
[SPEAKER_02]: family in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did a lot of depth and outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mostly it was mostly a Synganic type of
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They basically would pick up whatever was
at the grow shop because they've been
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was the type of the grow
shops would, hey, we have this,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would throw it out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically, I know from that and
they've always grown really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But obviously, I found out later on,
you know, when you do that outside,
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't really affect stuff because the
decomposition of so it doesn't really
[SPEAKER_02]: matter which book is a decomposition.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just kind of gets rid of anything
that's bad because it's outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the microbes and stuff are eating away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it doesn't really matter what you
put outside type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not really Synganic.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's kind of hard to explain,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's the only thing I don't
I've never did Synganic anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure we can get into some of the
details later on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kristen, tell us a bit about what you've
been growing recently and your experience
[SPEAKER_04]: with organic, your setup kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just recently harvested a skyline
from H&L and I harvested a pea berry and a
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble berry V2 for Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my other flowering space,
I have garbage cloud from from pack going
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: My setup is, I mean, it's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one four by four for my veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that I have one of those chrome
racks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have like three layers to be able to
move plants through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have two, two by fours for
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: One for flowering and one three by three
for drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simple, small space, but I'm still able to
go through quite a bit of numbers just by
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping things like small.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in terms of like the synthetic organic
thing, you know, in your experience,
[SPEAKER_04]: how much have you how much time have you
spent with either approach?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first started trying to grow,
I was doing just like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: soil that I was stealing from around town
and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, I never harvested anything or,
you know, like other than some wispy
[SPEAKER_01]: bracks and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I started, like,
actually, you know, buckling down when I
[SPEAKER_01]: got back back home in 2011, I went to
hydro just because.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got an Ed Rosenthal book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And was like, fuck it, I want to try flood
tables, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when, like, I actually started
cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that till 2015, early 2016,
and I had to take a little bit of a break
[SPEAKER_01]: for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I came back, I wanted I wanted to
try out organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been doing doing the whole like,
quote unquote, living soils stuff for the
[SPEAKER_01]: past four years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I grow I want to preface all of
this whole episode by like, I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: that any one style has supremacy in terms
of like smoke and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more so however you grow best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am not a good hydro grower,
but I am a good organic grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only reason I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not because of some weird dogma or
anything like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of us, I think, just grow relative
to, I don't know, arbitrary arbitrary
[SPEAKER_04]: constraints in our lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the space that you have, the the
products you have access to at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, there are lots of like
arbitrary reasons why we grow the way we
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, like I was saying to you guys
before we started recording, I think
[SPEAKER_04]: really the value in hearing from different
people is is hearing about the different
[SPEAKER_04]: conditions that they grow under and why
things may or may not work under those
[SPEAKER_04]: conditions, rather than just trying to
state like, you know, silver bullets,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, oh, yeah, this is just good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like an abstraction of anything that's
never true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: With growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this is just a broad invitation
to to all three of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three of you to think about your
experience, think about why things may or
[SPEAKER_04]: may not have worked and for what reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think talking about tech tech and
strategy in that way is a little bit more
[SPEAKER_04]: generous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're not just saying,
oh, we just we do this because it's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do this because it's the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that that's never that's never
really true in isolation of everything
[SPEAKER_04]: else.
[SPEAKER_04]: With that qualifier, I might bring it back
to Bumcat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one thing I guess now we're kind of
getting into the the the actual meat of
[SPEAKER_04]: the conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a point here about how one
might try to define organic growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's another phrase that you use,
Bumcat, that was kind of intrigued by,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is the great compromise.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe do you want to kick us off with
some of that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what are your thoughts around,
you know, what what is organic growing and
[SPEAKER_04]: why do you think of it as a great
compromise?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's get into the meat of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: So first, I'm going to kind of define at
least from everything that I've read and
[SPEAKER_05]: my anecdotal experience, the kind of key
differences between salt and organic just
[SPEAKER_05]: on a very simple level.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot more depth that we can go
into this later or another time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But salt is essentially the most basic
form of mineral that a plant can absorb if
[SPEAKER_05]: it's held in the right place.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a suspension for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And organics is creating and utilizing
like a relationship, a symbiotic
[SPEAKER_05]: relationship with fungal networks and
microbial networks within your actual
[SPEAKER_05]: media to facilitate an exchange of sugars
from the root zone in the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: With those microbes, it will exchange
those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: The great compromise is a very growing
organic plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an artificial light source.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're using more often than not potting
soil that's coming out of a bag that's
[SPEAKER_05]: being mixed by somebody at a facility and
not using traditional amended earth,
[SPEAKER_05]: although that is a possibility if you have
the space and are willing to commit to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the great compromise really centers
around what an indoor organic grower has
[SPEAKER_05]: to do when they're growing, because you
are never going to actually follow nature
[SPEAKER_05]: 100% when you're adding in artificial
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in my instance, I was growing in an
apartment in a two-by-four for the last
[SPEAKER_05]: two years, and I wanted to run through
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to see as many different phenos
of many different plaques that I could
[SPEAKER_05]: see.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I spent the last two years just really
going at it, and I never grew the same
[SPEAKER_05]: plant twice.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really taught me a lot, and it forced
me into growing smaller-sized plants in
[SPEAKER_05]: that space and using one-gallon pots,
which ironically goes against a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: living soil kind of principles and ideas
with the small pots.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm going to get attacked for that
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not living soil, but I made it work.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very much possible if you just really
pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you know what you're using and you
understand the system fundamentally,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can appropriately size your plants
prior to flower with the right amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: veg time, and you can make the system
work.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use things like enzymes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use all sorts of ferments,
different things like that that can aid
[SPEAKER_05]: and catalyze different processes within
your media to really get the full use out
[SPEAKER_05]: of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've tried growing in 20-gallon pots
in a two-by-four, and you can only fit two
[SPEAKER_05]: of them in there, and it gets really
crowded really fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was forced into a much smaller
compromise with smaller one-gallon pots in
[SPEAKER_05]: my space, but largely the compromise is an
individual compromise for every indoor
[SPEAKER_05]: organic grower who's trying to follow the
general organic system of growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bum, I have a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing for nutrition?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using fish hydrolysis to feed
them, or are you just top-dressing a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one gallon is small, so how do you
compensate for that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was using a lot of things like
fish hydrolysis and
[SPEAKER_05]: top-dressing a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was also using things like Build A
Soil's Big Six Micro's.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to name drop a handful of
companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am by no way sponsored in any shape.
[SPEAKER_05]: This podcast is not sponsored in any
shape.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't not get paid for this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We would love a check though, so come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was using a lot of things like that and
top-dressing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a big fan of Clackamas Coot,
actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the Build A Soil ideology,
which is a lot of things that taught me
[SPEAKER_05]: the fundamental living soil system
principles, are derived directly from a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of the things that he was talking
about on the forums back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's really big on things like
vermicompost, which are just essentially
[SPEAKER_05]: worm castings.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other things like sprouted seed teas.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really brew teas just because it
was really difficult and they absolutely
[SPEAKER_05]: stink in apartments.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of really inconvenient for
when you're actually growing in a confined
[SPEAKER_05]: space where you're not allowed to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The way I was growing, I was doing a
week-long veg.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would go straight from clone into a one
gallon pot of Build A Soil soil just any
[SPEAKER_05]: run of the mill.
[SPEAKER_05]: Essentially, when I would mix the actual
pot and when I was transplanting,
[SPEAKER_05]: I would add probably about one-third of it
as worm castings.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'd take some lava rock, which are
just essentially really porous and add
[SPEAKER_05]: aeration and add about a third of those
in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I would just grab about two pinches
worth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm more of a kind of just dump and you'll
see kind of cook at the end, but I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: really use a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of measurements.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get into this later when we talk
about pH.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be a fun one too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was taking things like HashiBlend,
which is a fermented grain product that is
[SPEAKER_05]: really rich in things like nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was using other things like that to kind
of catalyze my process.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of followed a really intense
dryback push for the first couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_05]: of flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would really allow my roots to get
established within that media.
[SPEAKER_05]: Depending on what I was growing in the
length of flowering time, I would top
[SPEAKER_05]: dress sometime between day 14 and 28.
[SPEAKER_05]: If things are going like 11 plus weeks,
the longest thing I have anything I've
[SPEAKER_05]: grown is 13 weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would do something like closer to 28
days.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm doing something shorter,
like a eight to nine week, I'm going to do
[SPEAKER_05]: something more along the lines of day 14
because I don't want a large amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: nitrogen going into the later flowering
period.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would rather have the plant try to pull
as much of it possible in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it's actually using nitrogen,
I would do that in the earlier stages of
[SPEAKER_05]: flower rather than getting an over
nitrogen fed plant towards the end of
[SPEAKER_05]: flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember KT talking about pulse feedings
being a thing from TLO.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have anecdotal experience of that really
well for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would do something like on day 21,
I would do a really high dose of like,
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say it's two teaspoons per
gallon of fish hydrolysis and like a dose
[SPEAKER_05]: and a half of what's recommended for the
micronutrients from the big six.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just really hit them hard for that
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then that can would usually last me about
two days.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be like day 21 and 22.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would get a really intense feeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I would literally just be water only
with a handful of really small additives
[SPEAKER_05]: like Kuyaha extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or like a horticultural coconut oil or a
freeze dried aloe vera powder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything like that that's rich in saponins
that will help aid with like minor terpene
[SPEAKER_05]: production and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although that's kind of based on theory.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen anecdotal evidence in my own
grows of it helping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kyle, you also grow in relatively small
containers, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Any comments on this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, right now I'm doing one gallons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started out in twos and threes,
but I wanted to look through more plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've slowly adapted to where I'm able
to do one gallons with the TLO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since everything runs pretty hot in TLO,
I'm able to do the one gallons because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's enough food in there to where I've
only done water before.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to get yield,
but that's not what my importance is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care about yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: I care about just good smoke for myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's not really a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done all kinds of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like I said, within TLO,
there's different stuff you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a micro pond strategy you can use,
which is like after watering, you can add
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say like alfalfa meal, you can add that up
until about halfway through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So say about day 28 in the morning,
you could stop something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of weird for people because I
know they think that will cause a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: herms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's a big thing with the
tricantinol.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that's how you say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not exactly sure because I always have
to read.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never hear people say words.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always have to read it myself,
so I'm not sure what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know that's a big thing with alfalfa
meal, people think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's just other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done top dressings and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spikes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all the different kinds of stuff
you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just kind of utilize depending on
what's going to happen in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now I'm running really,
really super hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to make sure I have a lot of
food.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this time I did spikes and I'm doing
the churn.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit of micro pond.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just doing different kind of stuff because
everything's messed up right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because nothing's going right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm everyday switching, especially in
California heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bumke, did you have any prompts for Kyle
or Skrewston based on what you were
[SPEAKER_04]: saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions for them in turn?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let you know if I do, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you want to move on to next?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a fun one.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go back to the first round
table of you, Spindle, Earn and Local.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to touch on the...
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go back.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to touch on the higher floor
and higher ceiling than salt topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going back to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to talk about this.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to say really clearly what was
said in the episode?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the conversation that you guys had
really centered around the concept of
[SPEAKER_05]: organics in general, having essentially a
higher ceiling and a higher floor than
[SPEAKER_05]: salts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really have mixed feelings about that
statement kind of as a whole.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel it's a slight misnomer because I
feel like the level of entry to find
[SPEAKER_05]: really good knowledge can be quite
difficult for a new person.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have... Sorry to interrupt you,
but yeah, I would have thought maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: higher ceiling, lower floor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's definitely what I would have
said because I myself have grown some
[SPEAKER_05]: absolutely horrendous organics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to get Katie's and Skrewston's
opinion on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for me, I feel like once you
understand the basic concepts of how these
[SPEAKER_05]: systems work and how you're kind of
utilizing the general relationships of
[SPEAKER_05]: microbes and fungus within that root
system, it's pretty easy to manipulate.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I feel like getting to that point
takes a little bit of more dedication and
[SPEAKER_05]: actual time researching and understanding
general concepts within organics.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I wanted to get the other two's
opinion on that because I feel personally,
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of organic growers are so tribal,
they're not willing to admit that you can
[SPEAKER_05]: grow bad weed organically.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know from firsthand experience,
it's very possible to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you go back to Skrewston before Kyle
and Skrewston, what's your experience in
[SPEAKER_04]: terms of the best and the worst?
[SPEAKER_04]: How is it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow bad organic weed,
I promise you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the top end, that I'm a little iffy on
because I've had really, really good pure
[SPEAKER_01]: salt run stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe like shelf life, I definitely
noticed that even my friend group down
[SPEAKER_01]: here, some of them do grow both ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there seems to be a longevity bonus on
their organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality seems to stay a little bit
longer with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't, I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's because it's just
more well rounded, like, while growing or
[SPEAKER_01]: what.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there's a lot of really bad
information about organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't it's, I don't know,
it's hard enough, as someone new coming
[SPEAKER_01]: in, even when you get, you know,
good information, it's hard enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: start kind of actually applying it
correctly and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's like, there's a lot of real,
you know, you could always just go off of
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'm going to get A and B.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this dude told me to get, you know,
a cow mag supplement and just go by the
[SPEAKER_01]: the rates that it says on the bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're probably going to do pretty all
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think that's a really good
observation, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think Bumcat did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, all of you have alluded to this in
some degree or to some degree.
[SPEAKER_04]: The notion that the resources that you
have access to and the information itself
[SPEAKER_04]: is kind of like, not it's a I was going to
say it's a problem, but like, it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: technique.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, yeah, if you if you can't even
get reliable information, then you're not,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, how do you even start properly?
[SPEAKER_04]: Kyle, what's your experience of the floor,
quote, unquote, and ceiling of organic
[SPEAKER_04]: growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I only grow really great stuff,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've obviously grown some bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's that's that's kind of
silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody has bad growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care who you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody has bad growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody who doesn't is I think they'd be
lying to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty bad growing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, hey, it happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, I always say I always have
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always I'm always trying to fix
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens, you know, open your tent up
and it's like, oh, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: What what what have I got to fix today?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking, oh, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just water and now it ends up into,
you know, 45 minutes of something,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, trying to fix something or,
you know, what happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to figure out why why that
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, why is this color on the leaf
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why what type of thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as resources, what I found was
best to great organic resources or older
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like Rodale's Rodale's organic
composting Rodale's organic gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are really great books because
they're older and they don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: that corporate growing type of stuff
thrown in there type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always found the older stuff is
always better to go back, especially the
[SPEAKER_02]: books.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Rodale's always found are pretty good,
too, for especially for organic stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: going back for for starting out,
because it gives you not just it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: just cannabis, it's growing organic all in
general, which is great because it gives
[SPEAKER_02]: you the whole spectrum of all plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found that was that really helped me
out understand before I even started
[SPEAKER_02]: growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That helped me understand the basics of
what was going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eventually, once you get you got
to be consistent with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once you get consistent with you
kind of just fall into your own method.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like me, like some of the stuff
I do, I just kind of don't even have to
[SPEAKER_02]: measure type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of know, oh, this is what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, you just kind of get
into your own method and then you just
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have said this earlier when I
introduced this whole episode,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I'm not an organic grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe one thing I wanted to and it's
probably a bit of a tangent for now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one thing I wanted to ask for any of
you, really, but maybe I can direct it to
[SPEAKER_04]: Bumcat to begin with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you able to generalize for me what the
major differences between the,
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, popular systems are that you guys
have discussed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, you mentioned what is
this, like TLO, KNF, like Living Soul.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there broad distinctions that you
could draw that might help people
[SPEAKER_04]: understand what these different approaches
are?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are all kind of systems that have
been founded by different people in
[SPEAKER_05]: different areas for different needs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Overall, living soil, no-till,
there's a lot of academics that are like
[SPEAKER_05]: very, very highly educated on soil science
and soil biology and like the makeup of
[SPEAKER_05]: soil and all of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of them are really pushing the
living soil, no-till type of systems for
[SPEAKER_05]: larger scale, like agriculture to help
preserve and feed more people without
[SPEAKER_05]: essentially destroying the environment
through commercial agriculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a whole argument in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: TLO, I am not the most familiar with.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll probably definitely defer to KT on
that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for KNF and JDOM, they are kind of
offshoots of each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe KNF was the original,
but KNF stands for Korean Natural Farming.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's largely centered around being
able to farm in a system that is entirely
[SPEAKER_05]: closed looped to anything outside your
locale.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're not using anything commercial
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything that you're using is
essentially fermented and then used within
[SPEAKER_05]: dilution rates or varying dilution rates
for different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many different types of
ferments that have offshooted out of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there's JDOM, which I believe I could
be wrong on this one, but I believe JDOM
[SPEAKER_05]: was written by the author of KNF's son,
who focused more on less heavy food within
[SPEAKER_05]: the ferments and more focused on microbial
and bacterial growth and using those
[SPEAKER_05]: fungal and bacterial systems within your
soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have smaller little
cannabis-based offshoots from those
[SPEAKER_05]: systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard people talk about Pacific
Northwest natural farming.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all sorts of different kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: But essentially, each one was founded by a
different group or individual that all
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of are slightly off and different
from each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like salt and organic salt in
the broader sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Each system is a little bit more
applicable and easier for certain
[SPEAKER_05]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a couple of buddies who are
absolutely phenomenal KNF and JDOM
[SPEAKER_05]: growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything they do is focused around
fermenting and harvesting within their
[SPEAKER_05]: locale, using all sorts of crazy stuff
like horsetail, nettle, and fermenting
[SPEAKER_05]: those in different types of sugar
solutions.
[SPEAKER_05]: With water, you can do all sorts of
different stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they are all different systems within
the larger category of growing
[SPEAKER_05]: organically, with living soil kind of
being the most traditional amended earth
[SPEAKER_05]: style of organic growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You did really well because I kind of just
fired that at you on the spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we return to that, like the floor
ceiling conversation, was there anything
[SPEAKER_04]: else you wanted to add on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw that in the outline.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had an analogy, skiing, snowboarding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that yours?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So at least I can't speak for everybody on
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for me, I've done a little bit of
both.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I picked up snowboarding really,
really easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had a really hard time picking up
skiing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But once I picked up skiing, I found it a
lot easier to actually do ski and do that
[SPEAKER_05]: instead of snowboard.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I found it much more difficult to get
better at snowboarding than I did at
[SPEAKER_05]: skiing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for me, it's a really clear reference
that for some people, growing within
[SPEAKER_05]: organics is definitely going to be the
better way.
[SPEAKER_05]: For some people, it just fits their
individual system of how they understand
[SPEAKER_05]: to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some people have a really hard time
with organics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some people have a really good time
with organics the same way with salt.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to reiterate a point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that both KT and Kristen made
earlier that there is no individual way to
[SPEAKER_05]: grow everything universally better.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really comes down to the individual and
their preferences and their understanding
[SPEAKER_05]: of the systems that they're using and the
time spent to actually understand what's
[SPEAKER_05]: going on and how those processes work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any comments or questions from Kyle or
Kristen at this point?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not that I can think of.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you were talking about this skiing,
snowboarding thing, it kind of brought to
[SPEAKER_04]: mind, do you think an implication here is
also that if you can understand organic
[SPEAKER_04]: growing, what I put it, do you think it
necessitates having a finer understanding
[SPEAKER_04]: of the plant and its needs and the
ecosystem and all that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Seems like that's kind of what you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it definitely, yeah, I want to say
yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to say that with absolute
confidence.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for me personally, at least from my
observations, it feels that like I'm at
[SPEAKER_05]: least in my friend group, I'm a little bit
more in tune with having to deal with like
[SPEAKER_05]: individuals on an individual level and
kind of aid to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I feel that, yeah, it kind of forces
like a more keen eye and like a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: more centered focus on like each
individual as opposed to kind of being
[SPEAKER_05]: able to run a system where in salt,
it's a universal recipe that you slowly
[SPEAKER_05]: adjust over time for those individuals
once you've actually understood them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of goes back to the idea of like
organics.
[SPEAKER_05]: The plant feeds individually within an
organic system as it pleases, pulling what
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrients it desires out of its soil
within that facilitation of exchange of
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrients for sugars in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in organics, the plant actually is
doing all the work for you in the root
[SPEAKER_05]: zone.
[SPEAKER_05]: All you need to do is give it little
things here or there to do, like
[SPEAKER_05]: essentially as additives.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's at least my perspective on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna say, well, I think it's more
of like a, I guess, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: without being offensive, it's like a trust
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, no, no, no, but you're
basically an organic, you're letting,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's more of like tail though is like
basically all natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's as close to mimicking mother nature
as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're trusting that the plant knows
what it knows to do for tens of thousands
[SPEAKER_02]: of years compared to say synthetic,
you have to feed it every single day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me that you're not having trust in
what the plant does type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you wanna have control over
everything that you're feeding it and
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to organics, you're just having
trust that what you put in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant is gonna know what it does type
of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very well said.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about, I don't know,
Bunkhead, did you wanna get into like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you kind of went towards mechanisms like
uptake and in the outline you have a point
[SPEAKER_04]: that's like comparing nutrient uptake
between organic and soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is that what you just highlighted
essentially?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, more or less.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can kind of go, I refer back to my
outline real quick, but essentially,
[SPEAKER_05]: all right, I wanna phrase this correctly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Organics is creating and utilizing the
relationship symbiotic relationship with
[SPEAKER_05]: various fungal and bacterial systems in
your media that facilitate that exchange
[SPEAKER_05]: of sugars.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's actually called the
rhizophagus.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a relatively newer scientific
discovery.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanna say it was first written about
about 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can look more into it, but that
essentially is where the actual exchange
[SPEAKER_05]: happens with the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're feeding chelated nutrients to
a plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: the actual, I'm sorry, I wanna phrase this
correctly, but the actual bacteria that
[SPEAKER_05]: are creating that exchange in the root
zone start to die off similar to how
[SPEAKER_05]: muscles work.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the best way I've understood it.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you don't use a muscle over time,
it dies off and it atrophies.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's essentially what happens when
you're feeding chelated nutrients to a
[SPEAKER_05]: plant's root zone.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're using an organic system,
what's going on is through that
[SPEAKER_05]: rhizophungus, the plant is forced to
exchange sugars for that nutrition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, the plant doesn't have the
ability to actually uptake the nutrition.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's within that actual symbiotic
relationship, which is where the exchange
[SPEAKER_05]: of nutrients occurs for the plant to
actually feed itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that really highlights the main
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Second big difference I've read and seen
is that through these relationships with
[SPEAKER_05]: fungi and bacteria, you can more easily
access secondary metabolites, which can
[SPEAKER_05]: aid in producing a higher quality product.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is no guarantee that is what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is my understanding from my reading
that I've done on this subject.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very nuanced and very complex
subject with a lot of arguments and a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of different perspectives on this side.
[SPEAKER_05]: But from everything that I've read and
gathered, this is essentially what's
[SPEAKER_05]: happening in your root system.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying that if you're growing in
an organic system and you're applying that
[SPEAKER_05]: trust of the plant to do everything that
it needs, you are ... I'm not saying
[SPEAKER_05]: organics is better overall because of that
exchange.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can still grow absolutely phenomenal
product, just like Skrewston said,
[SPEAKER_05]: with salt nutrition.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do it at work every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: We grow great product.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easy to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that this is where the highest
echelon of highest quality cannabis can
[SPEAKER_05]: come from, but it's not a guarantee in any
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It still requires all the effort and the
individual attention of the grower to
[SPEAKER_05]: actually get that done within that system.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just believe the system can help you
more easily access it once you have a
[SPEAKER_05]: better understanding of it as a whole.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm very impressed that you can ...
I'm walking a fine line.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm going to get some DMs about
this, but everything I'm going off of is
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff that I've read online more often
than not coming from academic sources.
[SPEAKER_05]: I majored in English in college,
so I have no issue reading.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will dive head first right into a
60-page paper if I need to understand
[SPEAKER_05]: something, just so I can make my life a
little bit easier in that actual
[SPEAKER_05]: understanding of the process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say this as well, going back to my
earlier qualifier, we're not here to ...
[SPEAKER_04]: distribute theory perfectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not really the point.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here to talk about our experience
and opinions on these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We may not get it perfect, but I think
people are going to get the idea at least.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else on this, on mechanisms?
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, what would you like to talk
about next?
[SPEAKER_05]: We can touch on cation exchange.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to get into that with cocoa
versus a traditional potting soil type of
[SPEAKER_05]: thing, I have a rough little paragraph on
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe before ... Yeah, that sounds good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we jump into that, Kyle and
Skristen, what different kinds of media
[SPEAKER_04]: have you guys used?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've only done the rough stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, I'm doing my recycled soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've just been recycling and
re-amending.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the beginning, I did use cocoa as a pH
buffer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, we'll get into that later,
but that's in there for aeration.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't use that anymore, but I could use
cocoa because it does decompose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, that's obviously good for what
I ... in my thing for the decomposition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, it's a pH neutral.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's basically it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only used the revs, re-amended soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skristen?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mix my soil up, just like your simple,
quote unquote, coots mix, which is just an
[SPEAKER_01]: augmented Cornell mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: In one of my beds, I used black leaf mold
instead of peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in the other bed, I used your
traditional sphagnum peat moss as the
[SPEAKER_01]: base.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both work fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both have been working fine for years
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just use a regular ... not out of
preference, but just because it's what's
[SPEAKER_01]: at my local hydro store, I get the Build a
Soil 3.0 for my veg stuff, since that's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually moving through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Bumcat, we can talk about cation
exchange, nuution uptake, soil versus
[SPEAKER_04]: cocoa, if you want to kick it off.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, soil has a higher cation exchange
than a media like cocoa.
[SPEAKER_05]: In my opinion, that negates the whole
concept of the individual plants having a
[SPEAKER_05]: preferred rate of nutrition over the
course of veg and flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something to do with a media like
cocoa that acts more like a direct inject
[SPEAKER_05]: IV, where everything that you're watering
into the media itself, if it's in the
[SPEAKER_05]: right suspension, the plant is free to
absorb all of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing stopping it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas in soil, because you have that
relationship with the microbes and fungus
[SPEAKER_05]: that the plant uses to eat, it allows the
plant to actually dictate which nutrients
[SPEAKER_05]: are uptaken and which nutrients will not.
[SPEAKER_05]: The roots of a plant grown in a salt
system lose that ability to pick and
[SPEAKER_05]: choose which nutrients are being absorbed.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's in the right suspension,
ultimately the plant is going to uptake it
[SPEAKER_05]: as a whole.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like a good way to describe this is
that salt gives the grower a lot more
[SPEAKER_05]: control to be able to choose what's
available when for the plant to eat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas in soil, you're giving that trust
in the plant the actual control to grow
[SPEAKER_05]: and choose what it wants when.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've watched firsthand at work.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use Athena 3.0 recipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: We run that high efficiency.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a production facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've watched firsthand at work that plants
will not be happy and will not react
[SPEAKER_05]: happily to a high feed if that's not what
they want.
[SPEAKER_05]: A great example of this would be any puck
type genetics that I've seen or puck
[SPEAKER_05]: hybrids for that matter that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are not particular fans whatsoever of
any high nutrition.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did a little anecdotal experiment for
myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: My boss was kind enough to let me take one
of those home that didn't make the cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was curious and I ran one of them just
in the tent just to see, I wonder if this
[SPEAKER_05]: plant will grow a little bit better if
it's just not getting pushed as hard by
[SPEAKER_05]: being forced fed things that it doesn't
necessarily want at this time.
[SPEAKER_05]: The plant at work was about two feet tall,
little individual bracts stacked right on
[SPEAKER_05]: top of each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: At home, in a one gallon pot with a really
heavy top dress on, I think it was day 17,
[SPEAKER_05]: it turned out phenomenal and it grew to
about a three and a half, four foot plant
[SPEAKER_05]: in a one gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoked great, looked way better,
smell was way more pungent.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just kind of more of my anecdotal
experience of actually seeing that plants
[SPEAKER_05]: don't always like being forced fed certain
things at certain times.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know local prior in one of the round
tables has kind of brought up that in like
[SPEAKER_05]: Jax, I believe it's nitrogen is tied to
calcium.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's voiced that before he's had a hard
time with certain plants not just not
[SPEAKER_05]: wanting that much nitrogen, but they need
a little bit more calcium at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those two being tied kind of can cause
some problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is just from my general
experience and things that I've been
[SPEAKER_05]: listening to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Karl and Kristen, any anecdotes from
your own experience on this topic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, from my understanding, when you
feed, well, at least liquid shinganics,
[SPEAKER_02]: the way I understand it is, but the
preservatives and additives that get added
[SPEAKER_02]: that keep it for shelf life, that is
actually what feeds the nutrients to the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and it's all force fed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my understanding of what I've read
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously that's not anecdotal,
because I've never done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's why I think shinganics works is
overfeeding and the plant just takes what
[SPEAKER_02]: it can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's actually from the preservatives
and additives.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not actually the nutrients that's in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know about the nitrogen and
calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as I know, calcium has to be
delivered through the plant in the soil or
[SPEAKER_02]: through water because it's not mobile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't actually know about that part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of what I was thinking about
while he was mentioning all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kristen, any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Any comments?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think that I am smart enough to
have that type of conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say that in hydro, it felt like
whatever I ended up selecting was
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially whichever one ended up best,
which that's normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my soil runs, while I'm sifting
through packs of seeds, it's a lot easier
[SPEAKER_01]: for me to, even if I can't nail it,
like nail a plant to really fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: perform best, I still get a much better
baseline that I'm able to end up with a
[SPEAKER_01]: product at the end to decide on,
hey, is this worth keeping moving forward
[SPEAKER_01]: and trying to get it to its best?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking, well, Bumcat was giving us
a really nice account of the various
[SPEAKER_04]: mechanisms that I guess there are a couple
of different ways that someone could
[SPEAKER_04]: approach this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could, I imagine, make changes purely
based on your observations without really
[SPEAKER_04]: knowing the theory, which is a process of
trial and error, heuristics.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're basically just watching the plant
and trying different things and seeing
[SPEAKER_04]: what it does, which is a different way of
looking at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more of a black box kind of approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe come back to Bumcat,
I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you were getting into this,
I imagine at times your experience and the
[SPEAKER_04]: theory wouldn't always be in step.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you find that you had to do a lot of
experimenting on your own outside of the
[SPEAKER_04]: theory to actually refine your approach?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm still experimenting,
to be completely honest with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every run, I always learn something new.
[SPEAKER_05]: This plant never ceases to teach me
something that I thought I understood.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, my growing career has been a lot
of trial and error and just trying
[SPEAKER_05]: different things and seeing how they
react.
[SPEAKER_05]: Being forced into the two by four is
really kind of forced me into actually
[SPEAKER_05]: being able to understand and run through
plants like the way that I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I needed to understand what was happening
with the actual mechanism.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was forced into very much reverting
back to just the same books, re-reading
[SPEAKER_05]: the same passages over and over again,
just to make sure that I fully understood
[SPEAKER_05]: the concept and that I didn't misread or
misunderstand what they were actually
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to communicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing with the build a soil videos.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because organics tends to be in larger
pots, it's been a constant, OK,
[SPEAKER_05]: what do I need to do to adjust for this?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that, for example, diesel plants
are really heavy eaters.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that if I put diesel in a one
gallon pot, that's over eight inches when
[SPEAKER_05]: I flip it to flour, it's probably going to
end up close to three and a half,
[SPEAKER_05]: four feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to be really, really
hungry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know I need to feed a little bit more
within my top dress or maybe add in even a
[SPEAKER_05]: second shot of fish hydrolysate early on
in flour to kind of alleviate the pressure
[SPEAKER_05]: on the media doing all the work.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's been a constant run.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of trial and error, little things here and
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, let's try feeding one plant the whole
way through flour and see what happens
[SPEAKER_05]: with no flush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do one where they're going to get
just water only.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do one where I'm going to do a
little bit of pulse feeding with a top
[SPEAKER_05]: dress.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's it really comes down to the
individuals as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Certain plants don't like certain things
like I ran a Sensei Star Puck,
[SPEAKER_05]: a couple of phenos of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of them did not like anything to
do with a mustard meal that I used in my
[SPEAKER_05]: top dress, which kind of catalyzes the
microbial processes and.
[SPEAKER_05]: Within the top dress to break down a
little bit faster, it made the soil a
[SPEAKER_05]: little hot and the roots freaked out and
the plant just died like and that was on
[SPEAKER_05]: day 23.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a constant trial and error of new
ideas like, OK, what about this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's try this here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just it's constantly just let's do
little adjustments one at a time to see
[SPEAKER_05]: what happens and how the plant reacts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and why I wanted to gesture towards
this is because I think it highlights
[SPEAKER_04]: really well that despite there being a lot
of theory and a lot of theory that one
[SPEAKER_04]: could go and consume, there's obviously
going to be a limit to how much that can
[SPEAKER_04]: apply to your specific situation,
your specific individual.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, there's there's a necessary
limit to theory and how much it can do for
[SPEAKER_04]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to point that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you can absolutely you can
absolutely drown in the theory online.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's everybody has an opinion and
everybody thinks that their opinion is the
[SPEAKER_05]: most based in fact.
[SPEAKER_05]: My biggest recommendation would be to
check them against other sources.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do the little bit of extra work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do that half hour of reading.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really going to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go a long way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to save you a lot of time and
headache.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I I think about this in not just
in organic growing, but like in all facets
[SPEAKER_04]: of of this plant, which is that you can't
take theory for granted.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no there's not going to be any
theory that's comprehensive enough to tell
[SPEAKER_04]: you everything you need to know about your
your plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's just not reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's always going to be some
experimentation and experience necessary
[SPEAKER_04]: for you to, you know, really get really
get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kyle, do you want to say something about
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say a Socracatic caretick
is like how I like to think of myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know enough to know that I don't really
know anything, but I'm still going to kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of do my own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I just that's how I always
look at stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when when Skrusen was talking
before, I mean, I think has been really
[SPEAKER_04]: self-deprecating by saying he was smart
enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I for me, I think that the theory is
really intimidating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I can see why people would be like,
look, I'm just going to work with what I
[SPEAKER_04]: have, see how it goes, you know,
tweak it as it goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll keep an eye on the theory,
but it's not going to like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, fully informed slash overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just want to point that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in my opinion, honestly, the theory is
a really good general guide.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nothing that's going to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: 100 percent of the time, all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's you're still going to be going back
and checking small things, doing small
[SPEAKER_05]: differences that are going to be better
suited for your needs at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and there's something else you
mentioned earlier as well, which is if you
[SPEAKER_04]: have the patience and time and effort to
go and look at as many different
[SPEAKER_04]: perspectives as possible, that would be
very valuable, because then you can at
[SPEAKER_04]: least compare and you can see where they
overlap and where they don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that would be a lot more
constructive than just like borrowing into
[SPEAKER_04]: once buying into like one single theory
and like committing everything to that
[SPEAKER_04]: that single theory.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got another topic for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pot size.
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard Kristen mentioned earlier that he
does beds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a couple of questions for him.
[SPEAKER_05]: What size beds are you running in the two
by four?
[SPEAKER_05]: And how often are you reamending those?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have been, you know, attacked about
it before, but I run two by four beds in
[SPEAKER_01]: my two by fours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, the entire bottom is soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I do take like my plastic solo
cups that I use for pots for seedlings and
[SPEAKER_01]: clones and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have those pushed behind the bed so that
it creates like a air gap there so air can
[SPEAKER_01]: still be drawn through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I reamend them.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I flip, I usually add about a cubic
foot of compost or casting, depending on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if I have enough from my worm
bins or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I don't, I usually just use,
you know, like Malibu or Olie Mountain,
[SPEAKER_01]: either of those two, just because they're
pretty solid and consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I add some bat guano and some insect
grass in that top dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then about two weeks later,
I add what's called soft rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, what I'm trying to do is give
it just a base of food to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then depending on where I'm at in the
cycle is what I'm adding dry amendments to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of steer it a little bit for down the
road.
