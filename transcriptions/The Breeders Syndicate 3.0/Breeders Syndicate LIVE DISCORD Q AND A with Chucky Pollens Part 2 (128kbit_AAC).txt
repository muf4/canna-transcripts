[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_00]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_00]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_01]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_01]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew, and this is my near and dear
friend, Chuckie Paulins.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, guys, gals?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a second attempt.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought we were live when it started,
and it didn't really work out so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying not to cuss super fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about your weekend or your week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I wanted to say thanks for everybody
tuning in last episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool to be on the show and
finally getting some credit for what the
[SPEAKER_03]: credits do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to ask you, before we get
started, because you didn't give me
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity before we started,
are you sending me a check for last
[SPEAKER_03]: episode?
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about it after this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about it after this,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do obviously need paid for your hard
work.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to say thanks for all the
support.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got a lot of haters in my DMs,
too, talking about, I don't know what the
[SPEAKER_03]: hell I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a bum and all this crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to all y'all, I love y'all very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we didn't cover the Q&A's last time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole point of the show last time,
Matt, was the question and answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we're live, guys, gals, if you got
questions, drop them in the little chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't see the chat for some reason,
Matt, but drop them for Matt in the chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to go over some questions
from the Discord as well that we didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: cover last time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got some new ones as well today.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I was wondering,
did you get any naughty pictures?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a couple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mainly just dudes' balls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to see me the ball picks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lift the sack so I can see the dudes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The TPA.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to work with this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He called everything, well, maybe we
shouldn't say that on YouTube,
[SPEAKER_03]: actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I digress.
[SPEAKER_03]: But got butthole pictures, got some guys
wanting to do some collabos.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's great because I'm trying to break
in and drop my seed drops on you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got some big projects in the works,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But mainly, yeah, a lot of ball pictures,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you appreciate those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you a fan of writing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Over this weekend, it's the most balls and
buttholes I've seen since being locked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it took me back to a place maybe that
really isn't a positive state of mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, mom's always telling me,
like, keep your head high, just like you
[SPEAKER_03]: did, bro, before I went into jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay positive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you know me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get holding in on that shit,
that ADHD shit, like, oh, fuck,
[SPEAKER_03]: I get in on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I get on Instagram's and I start
making posts, like, like nonstop posts and
[SPEAKER_03]: shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I when I when shit ain't going
my way, like when you when you say shit to
[SPEAKER_03]: me sometimes, like, you know, I get wild
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I'm just I'm just I just
want to say, praise God, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm holding my head up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, just I'm glad to be here,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad to to, you know, be here on his
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Praise his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see this hat you have on.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this hat?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I had a lot of hate.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's in my chat last time saying,
I don't know, deal is shit about nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I figure, you know, I'm one of you
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to I'm one of y'all mad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here to shine the light on the game
where the light needs to be shined on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got three stages, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into some of these questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough about me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people, you know, had enough of me
last week, Brandon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get in these questions, Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, if you've got some questions,
drop them in the mother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we cuss now, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to probably get
blocked no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because of you.
Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get in these questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got some questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drop them in the chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try to hit them as we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, let's start off a little cabin
in the hood.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, if you could pick one for the
rest of your life, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kim, Sauer, OG Typer or Hayes?
[SPEAKER_01]: OG Typer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you answer first on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you pick?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it seems obvious to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kim, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wouldn't expect any less.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to waste our time with these
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but you go ahead, Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you pick?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably go OG Typer.
[SPEAKER_01]: OG Typer, because I can go back and get
some bub up out of it if I want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the OG Typers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I would probably pick OG Typers
this second.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to rock out for the Kim.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you're having a chill and
chillaxing Friday, Pinsir says.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you all are too straight out of
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chuckie the foot pollens.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, let's move on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Squirrel says, when you got the real dog,
the real D, a real high flower Hayes,
[SPEAKER_03]: why pop seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think at the end of the day,
if you're growing and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's really important to always
pop seeds if you got the space for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, me personally, I like to find the
new stuff when I can or I'm looking for
[SPEAKER_03]: that new thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it does get boring cropping out
the same shit over and over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's be real.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's fun for a couple of cycles,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it's like a treasure hunt,
Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you look out over at beautiful
horizon, you think like, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: is the grass greener over there?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like always.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What if I pop these seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some of the best shit in the
world was created by accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think to myself like if I pop these
seeds, maybe, you know, I find something
[SPEAKER_03]: cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's also, you know, when you're
talking about like the Breeder Syndicate,
[SPEAKER_03]: some of these guys, they make seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So being able to pop some of their work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, be some of the first people to
check that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these people like H&L and pop,
you know, goat farm seeds and stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they they really know their
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a lot of experience in making
seeds and working with genetics and have a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's be real, like I'm chucking the
fuck pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really, you know, I look to them guys
to kind of guide my hand and where I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: going, maybe not to my destination,
but just, you know, you know, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, we can, you can also
talk about sharing clothes and sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like trying to share your cousin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get those diseases that pass back
and forth between you and your friends
[SPEAKER_01]: real fast.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Viruses, STDs, viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What have you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got cold sores at the yin yang.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need no more shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit's rough, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, you're, you're less likely to
find, you know, the hop slate and viroid
[SPEAKER_01]: in seed pops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really know the seed transmission
rate, but it is a lot less than playing
[SPEAKER_01]: with clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there is that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's that, that we,
I mean, you know, just as well as me,
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt, I mean, just in the last few months,
I've seen a few cases of diseases and
[SPEAKER_03]: viruses and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, it ain't a joke,
you guys don't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_03]: With these clones dropping 300,
$400, $500, $1,000 on a fucking clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you get germs bro, bugs,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to tell people if, you know,
if someone's selling you clones,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very likely they're not in the
position to have the clones that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: selling, or they would be kicked out of a
lot of these trade circles where those
[SPEAKER_01]: clones exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if someone's doing that, it's usually
like a last ditch effort or all out of
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's scary saying money to someone
who's all out of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you never know what their jam's
going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's just a lot of people making
false scarcity on their elite selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually those elite selections are a
seed pop of three maximum.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is always that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's like, you tell me, Matt,
you give great advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said there's only like a handful of
people to have access to most of the
[SPEAKER_03]: clones out there, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, are you really, do you
really got what you think you got or do
[SPEAKER_03]: you just get scammed?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, it's math, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably got scammed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a lot of people buying the
diesel cut off of a, an individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I got so many messages about that
and it was, it was a bummer because every
[SPEAKER_01]: single time I'd have to be like,
bro, I hate to break it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was always the bearer of bad news,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't like doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't be, let me spend his stupid money
on clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go pop some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, they're very rare clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: A clone is like dog shit where everybody
that smokes it kind of universally agrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: They dig it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I could pull that out of
the air because I mean, even diesel,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of people who don't like
diesel because it burns and it's a pain in
[SPEAKER_01]: the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, just cause I like it,
don't mean you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, dude, just pop seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to put, you know, to put a,
put a period on that, there's so many
[SPEAKER_03]: good, there's not so many, I should say
there's, there's a, there's a solid core
[SPEAKER_03]: of people, especially like in the discord
that are making cool shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, I don't know why not pop
their stuff, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're working with a lot of the
clones that people are hyped about anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see some new cool shit anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get them from someone vetted.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Pac says, uh, also, or he says,
what is the Canon Illuminati anyways?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess for new people watching,
they don't know what the, they hear you
[SPEAKER_03]: saying Canon Illuminati be a part of the
sit at the table and they don't even know
[SPEAKER_03]: what Canon Illuminati might be.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I only thing they need to know about
the Canon Illuminati is that the Don is
[SPEAKER_01]: Denali.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all they need to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like fight club, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is, what is fight club?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never heard of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, also says, I'm assuming he's
talking to me, possibly you.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, tell us how you feel about
meeting your heroes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't be me.
[SPEAKER_03]: My heroes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you got to meet some, you got to go on
one of the trips.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the secret trips.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to go on a secret trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: All my jelly little haters out there
probably wish it was him, but it was me
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't shed no tears for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll catch you on the back and hold you
real tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell you everything's going to be all
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, uh, you know, I appreciate,
uh, you know, through some good,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's just say some good, good luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to get on one of the little
Canon Illuminati trips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little secret meetups was super cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the people that got me on
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really the dudes that keep the
discord and the breeder syndicate
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they invited me on this trip where I
got to meet everything was like eight
[SPEAKER_03]: other dudes, seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't count, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was fucked up the whole trip,
but I can't share a lot, but I will say
[SPEAKER_03]: that, uh, Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there the man, the legend,
uh, got to meet him, party out with him a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, he rocks out.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, he could party just like a young cat.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, dude, just getting to spend time
with people that have more experience than
[SPEAKER_03]: me, you know, and, and, and ain't,
you know, I've been locked up in the
[SPEAKER_03]: majority of my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, I can't call myself a real
grower or anything, bro, other than maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: a smuggler, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So smuggling around, being around these
guys was a dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come true and little fan boy ish maybe,
but Hey, I suck dick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not afraid to admit it, but anyways,
yeah, it was awesome to getting to try
[SPEAKER_03]: some good buds grown by the hand that made
the buds, the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You couldn't ask for a better trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we got to fish.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to smoke good, good buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to try a bunch of hazes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to lay in bed for three fucking
hours a night, wondering like where my
[SPEAKER_03]: life is at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I smoked too much band-aid haze and
I'm like, everything's flashing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get to sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoked some, uh, uh, uh, H and L's
electric mango, uh, haze or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: man, uh, same effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had some rank stranger off camera right
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt's seen it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he knows I ain't fucking lying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to show it, but he says,
you know, that's what gets these shows
[SPEAKER_01]: banned.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were on a tight, we're on a thin
rope right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just say that we, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the show to continue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be asking for the menu anyways,
but yeah, it was a great trip,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got them, you know, felt super corny
getting them, uh, Rob to sign my books,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I got him to sign my books.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's corny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty corny.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave us some sweet, uh, artwork from,
uh, like labels from the LBs back in the
[SPEAKER_03]: day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, man, it was a great trip,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once in a lifetime opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, meeting my heroes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, um, I think in the weed world
it's been rather lackluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some people like high and lonesome
first time I met him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he was already a good friend by
that time, but, um, getting to meet him
[SPEAKER_01]: was special.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several people that have been
quite, quite amazing when we get to meet
[SPEAKER_01]: him and, uh, not disappointments,
but guys like DJ short.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he told me that I didn't even own my
own company.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, Oh, I think someone else owns
your company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a nice dude that he was
referring to, but I was like, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, uh, that's, that's mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty sure I'm the only one that,
um, pretty sure I'm the only one that,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, owns this horrible company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I don't think people would take
credit for it, but yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and trying to talk to him about his
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It became evident that he wasn't at least
at that day, that time he wasn't too into
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about anything having to do with
his own strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, you know, if someone knows
your lines as well, you would see they put
[SPEAKER_01]: in the time and effort to ask good
questions and you would respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, no, he wasn't into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was like, dude, I get to meet,
talk to DJ short, spend time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's at my booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, no, it was, it was
absolutely horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to meet NCGA, uh, North tall girls
association.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a old school head from back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, he was cool, really cool shared.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the first person to share a peace
space with me at Emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, there are times when it's cool and
there are times when it really sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe you don't want to say their name,
but what's, what's, what's one time maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: that you had an impression of somebody in
the game and it ended up being the
[SPEAKER_03]: complete opposite that you would like the
coolest cat you ever met in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: The coolest cat I ever met.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CSI, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I met him, in person,
we had already been at kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say at odds, but we didn't
talk to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for damn sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I didn't have my impression of
him was that he was probably a conceited
[SPEAKER_01]: Dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it was too cool for school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I walked up to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, she was at the booth next to me and I
walked up to him, just shook his hand,
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced myself and left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that we were best friends
because it was weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He ended up being the coolest guy on earth
and not, not a conceited Dick at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite the opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's really cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: He seems really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I, I'll be honest, if it wasn't for
him, I probably wouldn't even know about
[SPEAKER_03]: like the breeder syndicate for real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause he, you know, I seen him on a panel
like years ago and kind of when I got out
[SPEAKER_03]: of jail or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just like, I had to be locked up for
a minute or whatever, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know, I didn't, I hadn't
really fucking looked at the internet for
[SPEAKER_03]: a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got on YouTube and I was looking up
weed stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know, trying to, trying to gain
some knowledge and they gained,
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to find, you know, shed the light
on, on everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but I was trying to figure out what
was going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I seen him on a little podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like, for some reason, when I
clicked his video, like the next time I
[SPEAKER_03]: got on YouTube, your fucking face was
right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, who's this dick?
[SPEAKER_03]: I started watching you and that one guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even 20 years ago or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, but yeah, I mean, dude,
just like that's an aspect, getting out of
[SPEAKER_03]: jail, seeing you guys fucking talking
about shit that I grew up smoking and
[SPEAKER_03]: smuggling and dabbling and Kim's and sours
and OG typers and hazes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I think it's this bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not good with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: She said she went to the dollar store and
got some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course it ain't working.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can y'all hear me?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we can hear you.
[SPEAKER_03]: The headphones suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't ever listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Need to get a better mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you talked to any new women in your
life?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any new women in your life, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than, I mean, some girls that they
try to holler at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the time, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying they, I mean, bro, they see the
gold gym shirt on and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know what it's game time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where you're at, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I used to live in California,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like not on base, but like close to Kent
Pendleton out there, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, like really out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: My, my dad was in a Marine and he was out
there and he met my mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out there in the Navy, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had been the machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I used to live out there, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember it, but I was out there
for, I was like three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did your mom get along with the women in
your life?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep it on the DL, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It beat up around here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Women run around anyways, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, we, we get off crazy topics here,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to rant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is a weed pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just reel it back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll back in.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, as they won't do some of these
questions here, uh, you guys, you putting
[SPEAKER_03]: on some fucked up questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could read these on, on,
uh, the YouTubes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think, think we will go legal next
year federally?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I doubt it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on who's president.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even then I doubt it until they have
it all lined up so they could take it from
[SPEAKER_01]: the mom and pops.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got to get their money first,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, let's see how much dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even, y'all are fucking with me
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't read all these dumb questions on
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all are trying to get us canceled.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in here saying it says,
uh, George Jetson says on top or top
[SPEAKER_03]: plants preference for cropping versus
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I guess that's one thing on top or top
plants preference for cropping versus
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a squat little Afghani,
you don't top it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, otherwise, I mean, for breeding,
you want to have as many sites as you can
[SPEAKER_01]: get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can fill up, uh, all those nice
little bracts with seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just depends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and then the second part was the plant
that got away.
[SPEAKER_01]: The original still LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: The LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an old, uh, Afghani one cut,
um, from the LA moon posse tribe,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was like, uh, electronic DJ crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they were always who was attributed
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came via them, but it was a old Afghani
number one, according to what they said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just really dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, almost like ammonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when you smell it and burn your
nose hairs, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, it was one of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People still, uh, uh, pass around the
public cup that they call LA AFI now,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this was much different than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, uh, why are you say favorite
blueberry?
[SPEAKER_03]: I X cross from at the Hill grower from the
crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the one you recently dropped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one that I'm really looking
forward to that bitter just put out and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be probably in the,
in the Patreon discord, $50 to your packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: When those go out next, probably two
months, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's going to be the strawberry cough,
blue and cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very looking forward to that one only
because, you know, strawberry cough has a
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy berry nose to it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, different than blueberry,
uh, different genetics in blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I have some going myself soon,
but those are going to be in the 50 tier
[SPEAKER_01]: for the people who are a part of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe if there's new people watching,
what's the 50 tier?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, 50 tier that's when you're in the $50
a month, you get a pack a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: For each month that you're a part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually every three months we send out
the packages since yeah, it's expensive to
[SPEAKER_01]: send out fucking 50 plus packages a month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and also exclusive drops and shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually like if one of the breeders,
uh, in the discord, like POC or H and L
[SPEAKER_03]: are working on stuff, sometimes they'll
put their new stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get to see it before everyone
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: The TGA stuff with CSI just, uh,
was dropped last time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it's like with the competitions and
shit that we're working on, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: with H and L, the, the, the ones that
we've been doing, it's like he released,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, to the mango haze and he said he's
probably not ever going to fucking drop it
[SPEAKER_03]: ever, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, this is cool shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to be in on the early stuff,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, let's see here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a couple of ones here from
biscuit flipper.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says origins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Story slash background on the Sharon cut
of white widow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you want me to keep reading the rest
of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause he's got a bunch of stuff here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, I, I read it was from Lone star
and it was, and was wondering when it came
[SPEAKER_03]: about, have a buddy who's trying to track
it down and is wondering if it's the one
[SPEAKER_03]: he had up near Dallas back in the mid
nineties, he might just pay 500 for the
[SPEAKER_03]: cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: If so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off, I will say there's been some
debate about someone selling the cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't say the, the gentlemen and gentle
woman's name, but be careful who you buy
[SPEAKER_01]: that shit from.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one for sale that you can buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like a fucking Bubba Kush
cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not fucking Sharon widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sharon was really fucking ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, really, really hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the leaf curl.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just never fucking happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big, huge colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a short squat, little Afghani,
not super frosty, not really resinous,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, came from Lone star originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, mid two thousands early,
early to mid two thousands out of Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what white widow cut,
what I don't think Lone star was passing
[SPEAKER_01]: that cut around openly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I doubt it was just some cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone got as white widow in Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much doubt that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, right now the only person I know with
it for sure is crazy composer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he's got great pictures of it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to see the real Sharon
widow, go check out his Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, other than that,
like I don't really know anybody passing
[SPEAKER_01]: it around or selling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't go buying cuts of Sharon widow
unless you get it directly from composer
[SPEAKER_01]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can fall back on the HLV
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know what has what who's keeping
their rooms like separated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who can identify HLV in the first place?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, be careful guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your sticks on the fucking ice,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, this is from Chakra Zula Zulu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, also when you guys speak on,
I don't know why I said also let's just
[SPEAKER_03]: come further.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, when you guys speak on the open
pollinating, do you use one male or
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple ones?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you use multiple, how do you go
about moving forward or back crossing when
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't know who the daddy is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Also speak on reversing of males to
females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So open pollinating means you're taking
every seat you have and getting every.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every male with every female,
that's, that's open and pollinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, uh, how do you know what daddy was
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to take it forward,
you don't, you go by traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you won't know what daddy hit what.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like saving clones of each one
is advisable, uh, of the males when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing an open pollination, because you
can't just think, Oh fuck, that was,
[SPEAKER_01]: that made some heat, you know,
cause you just won't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you could do an open pollination and
then also take, be very careful with the
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen from each male and, uh,
hit a clone of each female.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go that way, that's also
directional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, if you want to work it forward,
you just work it forward by traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't work it forward by, um,
what potential male hit what potential
[SPEAKER_01]: female it's all about trait work at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what was the other question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Male, male reversals onto females.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so people, people have this weird idea
of reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, males don't, if you reverse a male,
it's not going to just turn into an all
[SPEAKER_01]: out female like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not really going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like, uh, a few bracks on a male,
like female bracks on a male, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: making seeds with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a novel fun idea, but like there's,
I don't really know anybody's ever found
[SPEAKER_01]: anything at a male reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually you're doing that just to check
out any traits and any visual or sent
[SPEAKER_01]: traits from the male side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you run the progeny, um,
of anything from that plant, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a not reversed portion, you can see the
traits come through and you'd be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, this is from the male because I saw
that the terms, but it doesn't always mean
[SPEAKER_01]: that those traits are going to pop up just
because you can identify them or,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, or you've witnessed them at one point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we got another one from stone or stone
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fucking pizza rolls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mom made me killing me, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can I really tell the difference?
[SPEAKER_03]: Between pistols Browning due to
pollination versus pistols Browning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a new grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: If this is a dumb question, it's not a
dumb question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, it's just all depends on
timing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it's a week after you've hit all
the plants, then you hope that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be from pollinating, but yeah,
they pistols Brown, they die off that they
[SPEAKER_01]: die off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's actually stigma is not
pistols, but, um, yeah, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, it's, it's that, and then,
you know, if it's pollinated, you'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: the Brack slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We start to swell and then you'll know for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're not pollinating at the end
of a, uh, a plant's life cycle,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're going to be seeing Brown
Browning hairs or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, you're, if you're going to be
hitting something with pollen,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're usually doing it within,
you know, uh, we anywhere from depending
[SPEAKER_03]: on what you're growing anywhere from like
two to like week four, maybe even longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're fucking with other shit,
hazes and longer flowering types.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, you're not, there's majority
of the time, all the hairs are white.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you hit them, usually within a
couple of days, depending some,
[SPEAKER_03]: some take a week, some, some are two days.
[SPEAKER_03]: You start seeing some kind of coloration
or I'm dying back or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess a little bit, but yeah,
it's, it's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, screws him.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't answer or we can't, we're trying
to keep this a good show, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to get banned here,
bro, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drop some likes, drop some supports.
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask questions too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask questions if you want, you know,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask Matt, you got Matt here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a rare opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also while we're talking about these,
some of these questions we've have been
[SPEAKER_03]: asked before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know some people tune in our big
time, fucking big wiener experts and are
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking these are little newbie
questions, but guys, we got new people
[SPEAKER_03]: coming in every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to help them on their, on their
journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the end of the day, I would
recommend those new people go back and
[SPEAKER_03]: watch the old episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know, a lot of these questions
are on the old episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just watch, watch them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a weird question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never heard this term.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you used DLE design of experiments to
choose your males?
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, have you had, you have five
females and two males.
[SPEAKER_03]: You hit each male to complete set of
females.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take serious pollen control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't play with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't play with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't play with multiple male,
unless I'm doing an open pollination and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's only then I don't use more than one
male because yes, take serious pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: control and pollen contamination is,
it just doesn't take much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, I only do one male to females.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, like there's, there's one
thing that none of us ever really talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is what happens when a plant herms
in a room, in a room that you've,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, dusted with a male.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the question I got, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So here, so you're a breeder, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing your little chuck or whatever
reversal or whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a herm in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You realize after you made all this seed
at the end of the day, say you got a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: room full, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You realize at the end of the day,
as you go into these buds and stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're seeing maybe some little plant in
the corner that you didn't notice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she hermed out and it's the pollen's
fertile, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point, you don't know what the
fuck you got money invested in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people are probably just going to
send it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, have you ever experienced where
you had to throw it all away?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe you're not throwing away,
you keeping it for yourself and running it
[SPEAKER_03]: and just checking and just see if you pick
up traits, you know, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at that point, you just carry it
further to work it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or what would you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you, how do you handle that kind
of stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, like I experienced that with
the fucking Aussie bastard that looks some
[SPEAKER_01]: bitch stuck in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so obvious because those leads
are so obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's in the first round,
you know, it was from, uh, a herm
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially, because it wouldn't show up
if it was from the, uh, I, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's only if it was a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, those I just kind of pretty much
gave away or put on deep sale,
[SPEAKER_01]: like $20 a pack and let people know,
Hey, there was pollen contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about all the best you can do is
shit like that or toss it one or the
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I would imagine most people that make
seeds would just send it out because you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, you're going to get, unless it's a
totally different line, it'll be super
[SPEAKER_01]: obvious, which I've seen many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one of those plants, like a Girl Scout
cookies will end up in a pollination of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, above across the OG or that's
kind of bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like Bubba and blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden you see some Girl
Scout cookies popping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, someone had a Girl Scout cookies
Herman there and just let it go,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but, um, yeah, ideally you'd
hope they wouldn't and that they would
[SPEAKER_01]: make it known, but that's not always what
we see.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it goes both ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, I guess from a new breeder's
perspective, you know, it's trying to get
[SPEAKER_03]: into the game or whatever you want to call
it, the industry, you know, if you,
[SPEAKER_03]: it is your, ideally you've kind of built
up to this point, but I was just thinking,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, like, what if you are new and you
are trying to get into it and you do have
[SPEAKER_03]: a, a fuck up, how do you handle that?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I guess maybe like you said,
just be transparent as possible and let
[SPEAKER_03]: people, let them fucking know what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some of us are going to see that
shit and we're going to know where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew what that shit is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, bro, I, I come from the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to figure out how it
works.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, uh, I'm smoking dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some of this Irene S1 from,
uh, CSI bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking nice, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like the craziest potency in the
world or nothing, but the turfs and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything are on point, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Irene's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very nice cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, another old party.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, uh, is SDS or colloidal silver
better for creating reversals?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an old technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know anybody who uses it
effectively for, um, yeah, I just don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know anybody who uses colloidal silver
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an old technique on the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would talk about mostly,
um, there's been science papers where they
[SPEAKER_01]: use SDS and put it against colloidal
silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's found to not be as effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we just went straight for SDS with
my spray, which you can find on sale right
[SPEAKER_01]: now on riotteats.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good, bro.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm assuming there's other stuff
people have used in the past too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe even currently, uh, to maybe
cause the reverse reversal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything else you could kind of
talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, um, um, cobalt chloride is another
one, um, that's been used by Hyde.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I think it's, it's a secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't fucking know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, cobalt chloride or using just
silver without the, without the
[SPEAKER_01]: thiosulfate, uh, thiosulfate helps a lot
with, um, what's it called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just say that because I'm not going
to fucking use a big word right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cobalt chloride is another good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll burn the fuck out your plants though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you need a plant, there's some
plants like, like TK that you almost have
[SPEAKER_01]: to kill to reverse to get it to drop
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, whereas a lot of other plants,
you want them at peak health and don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want them to be burned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, this is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was, it was cobalt green,
cobalt green, if I remember correctly,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what we ended up, uh, running with,
but yeah, cobalt chloride is another one
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can use.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just buy my Matt rise brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmer Dan's got to spray too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmer Dan to shadow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get him selling it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we move on to Ari dragon.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, or they say, she says,
whatever them maybe, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, hell, uh, did you ever get any of
those Alaskan blueberry Rob mentioned in
[SPEAKER_03]: the video?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if so, are you planning on breeding
with them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know that Rob still has access
to that, but we have, um, there's another
[SPEAKER_01]: cut that's made it back in the circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Davi blueberry that I really
want to work with again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, do you ever sit on the shitter,
bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're just sitting there thinking,
I know you're, you've been talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: moving on from maybe a blueberry lines and
stuff a little bit, but do you ever sit on
[SPEAKER_03]: the shitter or, and you're thinking like,
what if there is one more out there that I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't, I didn't get to try or one more
out there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I can constantly constantly,
dude, constantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I mean, that's cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I appreciate that you so into blueberry
lines that we have to have somebody that
[SPEAKER_03]: is, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if it wasn't like, you got to
carry the torch, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's short, you know, kind of,
he brought the, the blueberry to the
[SPEAKER_01]: table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there might've been other
blueberries before him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but for a lot of people, including
myself, there was a lot of disappointment
[SPEAKER_01]: in buying a really expensive pack of seeds
called blueberry to not find one thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that was blueberry like turps turp wise or
taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, like I think most people
have that experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but then there was some great BC
blueberries, um, from the BC era guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, working with blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've crossed it to a lot of stuff,
but like, I could always run more of each
[SPEAKER_01]: of the things that I've crossed it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a few more that I'd like to go
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just found another pack of poodle nuts
today, which is, I thought I had given the
[SPEAKER_01]: very last of those to, um, um,
little Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he popped him and he was stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh shit, that does look
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, yeah, this is the best of the
poodle nuts, but I didn't save any cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found the very last pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, I think it's the last pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who fucking knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I am, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found like random packs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I didn't have any more of,
or, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I do some, I wanted to, before I forget
my home fucking scattered ring right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, something is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about earlier about clones
and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it made me think like, why the fuck
would uncertain stuff, especially,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, you know, trying your ex out,
it made me realize like, man, I don't need
[SPEAKER_03]: no cut of this when I can just have it in
a regular form, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: A regular sheet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that, I'll only pop the one pack and
every female that I got was some form of
[SPEAKER_03]: blue or blueberry or, or blueberry jam or
blueberry candy or some kind of mix of
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, like, like I said the other day,
going like two months in bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it still smells just like the
blueberry, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got them in the jar right here,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the idea with the, the in-cross
line was consistency, um, to have
[SPEAKER_01]: consistency in a, in a seed pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like ideally, I think even as new seed
buyers, we think, you know, we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: go buy a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says it's like this specific thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always say, oh yeah, it's exactly
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pop those seeds and we don't get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's pretty much, you know,
I mean, uh, and yeah, like that as a seed
[SPEAKER_01]: buyer from when I started to now,
the goal has always been consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being able to say it's like this high is
going to be like this for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it'd be like that for
everyone else, but the Terps are like X,
[SPEAKER_01]: Y, Z, you know, it looks like X,
Y, Z and, uh, being able to provide that
[SPEAKER_01]: was very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the most important thing I could
have done in my career was make something
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent several years.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really are too, even the way they
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had a question for you about them,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they, did you ever, at one point,
I mean, you're, you're bringing them for
[SPEAKER_03]: consistency, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them you're working with our
shorter plants, but did you ever see a
[SPEAKER_03]: tall blueberry IX or any kind of blueberry
that will run a little bit taller?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like all the ones I had,
they perform like what they're supposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, short and more of a squat
Afghani dominant types for the most part.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Terp profile was stuck in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you would, you really weren't finding
that Terp profile, at least in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the, in cross lines and, and the
bonnet, you weren't finding any of these
[SPEAKER_01]: broadleaf types.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are narrowly types shooting out huge
blueberry turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I did make one cross with the
blue satellite that kind of took it in
[SPEAKER_01]: that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: More narrow leaf, bigger Cola,
taller, lankier, but, um, for the most
[SPEAKER_01]: part, yeah, it's, it's, it's kept in the
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoy growing a man or easy grow
pretty quick flower, everything,
[SPEAKER_03]: man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I got, I made seeds with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to run some and find, you know,
a better expression, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the main thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're bringing out the blue when you,
when you outcross it, because it's a true
[SPEAKER_01]: B true breeding line in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: More, more, more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you, have you figured out where
you're going?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I ask you this every week,
bro, but have you figured out what
[SPEAKER_03]: direction you're going to go next?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm biting at the bit to know,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, like I wanted to do more
diesel work, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But me and CSI did some of that in fem
lines and he, he crossed it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more shit than I could have ever
imagined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the strawberry stuff, I got rid of
most of my strawberry stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trying to go back and rework my
strawberry stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have much of the strawberry stuff
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of passed it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the P 91 stuff I passed on to other
people who were doing work with the P 91
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's, and people seem to dig it and
that's rad, but, um, yeah, I don't quite
[SPEAKER_01]: know what I would do next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I really need to sit down with my big
fucking bag of collection stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like the only thing that really
appeals to me, like there's the Maduro,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was an Oregon purple tie line,
which is just more blueberry parentage
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of, um, shit, I don't, I don't really
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to do more sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to do more super skunk stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think I've done all I can do with
super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's hard to say I've got to do fem
work though, because that's all that sells
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, going back and being redundant
on blueberry and doing like a feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: blue and cross now that that would bring
out so many recessives and mutants that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that's even a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it, in theory, it sounds great,
but yeah, I don't know how it would,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, present speaking on that Maduro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I think it was, I always forget the
name bro is fucking was it black cherry,
[SPEAKER_03]: black cherry, white rhino to anyways,
I ran those out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just called it the Maduro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just cause it was easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate, I fucking can barely read and
write, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, anyways, I ended up with two
females out of like the six seeds of the
[SPEAKER_03]: real old seeds you sent out with the
patron shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I popped them, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got two females out of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the one was just a little,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: She just was kind of didn't really,
I ended up chopping her.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I ran the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I first tried it, dude,
I was like, this is all right,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's that classic case of like,
I let it cure for like a month and I had
[SPEAKER_03]: smoked other shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was smoking the skank dog and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I go back and smoke it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was fucking pretty nice,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I can't at the end of the day,
I threw it away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but I ended up growing them out,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember nice, but I didn't get a male.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just ended up checking it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot in that parentage of those
seeds, which is the only reason I never
[SPEAKER_01]: ran them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I want to just find the Maduro stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that, that was already a special
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the, the Maduro stuff I remember came
from the same dudes that the, the Rose
[SPEAKER_01]: flow came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I see Alkaline man or elevator,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always get the two confused,
but yeah, it's interesting shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rose flow is one of the hardest grows I've
ever had in a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was never fucking happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't a good line in itself,
but when you out crossed it, it made
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing F1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's the thing I'm learning,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of getting out of the jail and shit,
like fucking all these new lines and shit,
[SPEAKER_03]: man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't, you realize like not all lines
are the same, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like some shit or not all everything,
some shit fucking grow great for you in
[SPEAKER_03]: one way and you put some else in their
same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't grow with the fuck, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom grows better than I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think sometimes, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a, here's an Instagram
comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what is better is to breed with
official pollen from plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good, good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Official pollen from plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's official?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to fucking whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking paid dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's official.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Kevin 20 here and I'm official.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing a Q and a again, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, herbs as D says, uh, is P Hayes going
to take over the world?
[SPEAKER_03]: P Hayes con coming soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people seem to like P 91 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there, I didn't make a ton of the S
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still a few left that,
uh, some people have gotten ahold of,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, bitter did a bittersweet did
amazing work to, to pull up the best,
[SPEAKER_01]: the better than what I saw it just in the
S ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he found some really, really cool
expressions and made what we call the
[SPEAKER_01]: sweet pea and other people have used seeds
from the sweet pea and crossed it like a
[SPEAKER_01]: little Lope crossed it to Andy Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say to make the P Hayes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's going to be out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I got a tentative right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show y'all, but we'll get banned,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get banned again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some of that going right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like not, uh, anyways, it's going,
it's going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, you know, when the, the P 91
first came out, nobody gave a shit about P
[SPEAKER_01]: 91 except San Diego people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a few of them and bitter was
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I gotta say anything that I've smoked
that has the P in it, bro, is,
[SPEAKER_03]: is good, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, how we were talking about
last episode where we're out, we're off
[SPEAKER_03]: some tangent on autos versus, uh,
traditional stuff, but we're talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: how, you know, you, you grow out of pack
and maybe like one, you're not really
[SPEAKER_03]: doing yourself just as growing out one
package.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're really trying to fuck with that
plant and good, but the, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, shit, bro, the Irene hit me,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't forget what I was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was going to say, I was going to say
I'd fucking went blind down, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, you know, anything with the P in
it, let you run that I've ran crosswise or
[SPEAKER_03]: it's been crossed into it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every packet, every plant in there is
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: If something, you know, it might be not,
maybe one don't have a structure,
[SPEAKER_03]: the right structure, whatever,
but the actual smoke, the flavor,
[SPEAKER_03]: the turps, anything with PF smoke comes
out pretty good, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's P. Like, I mean, I think it's at the
end of the day, like we like it and it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's in our group, but it's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like to like random people,
it's, you know, maybe I think it just
[SPEAKER_03]: comes down to probably the name,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Gregory Smith asked, did I grow up in
Nordal?
[SPEAKER_01]: If so, how was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I had some herm issues early on with
the Nordal, but it's one I'd like to go
[SPEAKER_01]: back and touch on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the few, um, Afghanis that
Shanti Baba put out that I would mess
[SPEAKER_01]: with, um, at least that I would try to
grow now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a lot of the Afghanis from him,
I did not like, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: he has some of the best, uh, narrow leaf
type plants, like the mango haze,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, um, super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's more, you know, you know,
you know what he has.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I'm looking here through some more
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Shy Guy says, how do you choose which
plant to reverse in a feminized cross?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever one reverses easier and more
consistently.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stagger guys, stagger your fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be in there yodeling with one
thinking you'll make it work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like God, dude, put it, stagger.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's anyways, go watch the old episodes,
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, you talk about this guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people putting joke questions in
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got like, we're funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like playing, like this is a game or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see, uh, PK ask where, uh, will thousand
fold be joining tonight?
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's too, too cool for us right now,
but he will be back eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's coming back guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got actual work to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't want to play while he's
working.
[SPEAKER_03]: Work bombs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I can't, I can't hold a job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even apply for a job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have an idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't do shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just sit around with moms all day,
kick, you know, kicking it, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watching prices, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_03]: When she not around, I get out like porn
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, uh, I think we ran through most of
these questions here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we got a couple more here.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you, uh, as Sean says, if you could go
back to one line, you made and start a new
[SPEAKER_03]: project from it, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_01]: The strawberry switch plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a, I, you know what, to be honest,
I can't even remember what was in that son
[SPEAKER_01]: of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the East coast, our diesel
strawberry cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was the double black Doja,
which was also a poly hybrid, but it just
[SPEAKER_01]: made for this really, uh, magenta looking
very strawberry scented Afghani type plant
[SPEAKER_01]: is gorgeous, consistent and a super
strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would probably be a one for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a, this, this goes to Jabs question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was my favorite Bubba hybrid I've
ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a, um, above a hybrid with
killer queen, like the original BCGA
[SPEAKER_01]: killer queen seeds that I popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one was fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked that one a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Serve a boy 47 says, can you tell us about
dog shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Also what sour was used with G.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in your and CSS collab, I'm growing the
dog shit, uh, X times sour X man.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't fucking read.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, dog shit, like I've only run it a few
times, so I don't really, I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really speak on it like well, you know,
I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the history on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other people who know that it was,
you know, some glass blowers from
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere doing something, bringing it
around to somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as far as the sour, that was the sour
that came from your, um, who was on
[SPEAKER_01]: another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go back and check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as far as history on it, like he has,
he has, he had it a long time ago.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came for the dog shit name electric
Boogaloo, you know, only because it would
[SPEAKER_01]: annoy the shit out of someone that I don't
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep calling it dog shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just because of that,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got Matt, I got a little beef with you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last episode, my mom was, me and mom were
kicking in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you hit me up earlier,
like asking if I could, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: jump on this podcast room, whatever,
real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was talking to mom about,
I was like, man, my mom, like real
[SPEAKER_03]: excited, like you get me back home and
he's getting mad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's finally coming through for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's like, yeah, but did you see last
episode on the fucking video thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: he spelled Kim dog with the fucking w bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, no, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd get on there and looking at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm thinking Matt's fucking ass over
here trying to play me or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want him to get it clear to all y
'all out there that I don't spell no
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking Kim dogs, no goddamn W's.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do fix AC units part time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do it because I need to do the
money or nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I like to fix AC units and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't make money from the game and
shit, but I really care about the.
[SPEAKER_03]: Home pink growers, you guys, you know,
our five acre farm that we call a farm
[SPEAKER_03]: that is actually not a farm, but for our
kids shit like this, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the industry, genomic projects and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, I will say that the first person
to spell it, the AWG is P bud,
[SPEAKER_01]: who was one of the people who was a,
you know, golf jockey or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the fuck he was,
but he was one of the people that was
[SPEAKER_01]: there when Joe brand sold the pounds or
weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the fuck he sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sold something and he spelled it DAWG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as I'm concerned, Kim dog is
spelled Kim, DAWG dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's pussy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the fuck with that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should have a Z at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I, if I had my say this, me and you,
after this podcast, we're going to get it
[SPEAKER_03]: straight.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to figure it out, but do you,
trust me, he's not your homie,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_03]: CK six says, do you plan to remake any
blue crosses with the IX instead of the
[SPEAKER_03]: blue bonnet?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you have any tips for getting the
best flavor and smells from the blue
[SPEAKER_03]: crosses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, make sure you cure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, you'll get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, hold on, hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I'm just enjoying the guy with the
facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: He thinks he knows some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the blue in cross, I would like to
eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, I still have more of the
original bonnet seeds to pop though and go
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that always interests me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, that's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and then his other question was,
oh, you answered both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, my bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just slow down the cure,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as far as like bringing up the
blue turps, I mean, you see the blue turps
[SPEAKER_03]: even on crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think it was at the,
I mean, of course it's called the blue
[SPEAKER_03]: hype.
[SPEAKER_03]: The great blue hype had it in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see now after growing,
uh, the IX, you can find really great blue
[SPEAKER_03]: turps in almost any of Matt's work that
had, you know, that has the bonnet in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not too far from the IX.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's fucking pretty spot on dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like y'all did a great job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I think we kind of ran through all of
our questions, guys, all of them,
[SPEAKER_03]: all of them done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we done?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, double check.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make sure we were sharing
everybody's questions and showing love to
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we got one more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: One fresh one heirloom Afghani remake
feminized Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like it had its long round and
then people got mad because it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't make a lot of them and I sold
them for a lot because everybody wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I have some left could, could do,
could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked the, um, I don't know the
process with it that I liked, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, I mean, it's just, uh, an old super
stunk type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's even better super skunks
than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nice, but yeah, it was also highly
variant, which, which isn't something I
[SPEAKER_01]: love.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's my biggest, um,
my biggest annoyance is variants in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in lines, uh, poly hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a, remember the Afghan 90s we talked
about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some of those going, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, a couple of men, when you rub the
stems, dude, I know it's not always a tail
[SPEAKER_03]: sign of everything, but they have this
really like kind of similar to the IX in a
[SPEAKER_03]: bit, but a little different, more or sharp
sharpness to the nose on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's just real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like two of them had this like almost like
blueberry kind of berry smells really
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't started flowering them or
nothing yet, but they're really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they had, um, you can go to the
real seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to check those out real seed
company, um, quick seeds, K W I K seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: The homie Angus runs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some amazing, amazing stuff on the
real seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of you that want to find good land
races.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the dude's been in the game forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has good sourcing on his shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't say something else about him
or about, about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is in the EU, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's you gotta make sure someone I ordered
on them, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I think it was more than what I
thought it was going to be because the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the transfer or whatever, the money,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so fucked up, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been drinking beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been, you know, but now, uh,
anyways, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's basically it guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any more questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Throw them in chat real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, yeah, give them a few minutes for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone asked, uh, if I smoke skunk six.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't know anybody who's,
uh, currently smoking skunk six.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been dead for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same cut as the VA super skunk
that came out of VA, which was from the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder from the breeder's mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: In all five Hayes, um, super skunk F2
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's been dead a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what the fuck JJ he
happened about fucking skunk six.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, he didn't have skunk six either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what the fuck he's talking about,
but then again, someone hands him a clone
[SPEAKER_01]: named skunk six.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always said, I'll, yeah, I keep the
name, whatever someone gave it to me as,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then he'll sell the seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So gotta love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love that, that hard work and integrity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he says it publicly though,
that he doesn't give a fuck, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to read you out, you know,
discord about my question last week show
[SPEAKER_01]: about sub Rob Maddely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reach out, reach out right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you trying to ask?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all smoking skank dog right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got some skank dog, uh, love.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you dude, honestly, out of what I've
grown in the last few months, it's
[SPEAKER_03]: probably my favorite thing so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got, I mean, the particular one,
I mean, uh, I mean, they all kind of smell
[SPEAKER_03]: similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones that ran the one that I really
liked.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you won't really that care that much,
there's some pictures, I think somewhere
[SPEAKER_03]: in the discord or just look up skank dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but, uh, it's just kind of a rancid
like coffee smell that, uh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: coffee skunky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like not really like spearmint,
but like a slight little bit of that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that kind of mint mint tinge to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, just like a bitter smell to it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how to explain it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really pungent, like really nice
on the, and that's what you taste too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I like about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You taste that and you know how sometimes
you put weed in a blunt or joint or a
[SPEAKER_03]: bong, whatever, and it doesn't taste like
what you're smelling, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I like about this and it
tastes, I taste what I smell.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For people asking about skunk six,
it was some people in Colorado had it as
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk six.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was passed around as skunk six back
then it is dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if people are trying to sell seeds of
it, they're selling you a fucking a myth
[SPEAKER_01]: and a dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been, the people have been doing that
with fucking super mass, mass super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't mass super skunk for ever
since I've been around and no one's
[SPEAKER_01]: produced it, the VA super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: The closest thing that was used with it
would be sour, you know, sour was used
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you're going to see the
progeny of any skunk six or VA super
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk, AKA mass super skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since it was the first one that they
renamed a mass super skunk and later they
[SPEAKER_01]: popped sensei super skunk seeds called
that mass super skunk two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't call it number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just called it mass super skunk as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's how them cam doggers do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that some old Greg?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Greg.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the shiny bits down below downstairs
mix up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think I've been thinking about
just why I'm taking shits and stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to drop stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe like modern shit ain't from Matt,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Modern stuff ain't for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's got to be something about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's got to be something out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could, we could, you can make a cross
of bro that gets more because I think we
[SPEAKER_03]: need young people in the space,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need not younger people to lead us,
but we need the next generation,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're dying now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, whether we like it or not,
we're dying out, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: There not many of those left, you know,
people talking about cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: There ain't even people that really got
the cuts when them fuckers are gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then where are we going to be?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be mylar cookies,
all that dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we got to get the people hyped,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Positivity, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love is love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love is love.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a, you know, there's only a few
younger cats that I've met that I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, this dude can carry some shit,
you know, like they care enough and to get
[SPEAKER_01]: it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I mean, once, once a few of us are
gone and you know, it's going to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody's really going to give a fuck about
what's what, who had what.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that shit's just getting me drowned.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, even if you don't give a fuck about
Matt or, or blueberry, like the fact is
[SPEAKER_03]: that no, hold on.
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact is you're a keystone,
a corner piece of our community and the
[SPEAKER_03]: broader community in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, bro, you brought so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anything, you bring everybody together
and you give us, you know, like D and a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple other guys, y'all bring us
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think if we could just stop arguing
about how important your color of your
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking ash is, bro, and focus on
important topics or whether I'm smoking
[SPEAKER_03]: weed out of your fucking butthole glass
style.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's, you know, we need to focus on the
bigger issues, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that butthole glass style might be
painful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to my question.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we working with in the future?
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to get something.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to come up with something,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to come up with something that I'm
going to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have to work with anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I just quit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Start growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Game over.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the ultimate.
[SPEAKER_03]: If Matt starts throwing auto flowers,
y'all know it's game over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I do it again, if I do it again for a
second time, yes, I have done it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You made them great.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time you could come back and
make them great again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make them great again.
[SPEAKER_03]: White widow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Auto flowers was on that auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody said, what are you doing
with that shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is it at?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: H&L asked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did Matt smoke all the auto flower I gave
him?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'll have to look.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I smoked all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't smoke all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't the worst smoke I've had,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent me a tricker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't tell me what it was and said,
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did because it's H&L and it was,
it was a tricker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it had a high to it, which is more
than I expect from fucking auto flower and
[SPEAKER_01]: people that call a fucking normal plants
photo period.
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm here to shed the light on the
game.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say this.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I went to that meetup, I just had
moved, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the, all my stash, I lived in a,
let's just say, I lived in a place where,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, I just didn't want to carry all this
shit across lines, state border lines or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause some of these states had crazy
penalties.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I gave all my, my stashes away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for like a few months, I was smoking
wreck weed up here, like a little weirdo
[SPEAKER_03]: feeling like depressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't even look myself in the mirror
and make love to my fucking wife,
[SPEAKER_03]: dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my point is- You got a wife?
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a few wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna play it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm out here doing it big, you know,
trying to, anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, you got me off topic talking about
random shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was I talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't tell you where that was going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, here it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gang of green horns.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, I have a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested in preserving big bang
slash making a strain out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a big bang times diesel as an S one
clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you use to breed it back to big
bang?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's got number one, LL one,
NL one and then El Nino.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is never a day I would try to
preserve a greenhouse seed strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't believe in Ariane?
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ariane?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't mean to be a dick,
but yeah, for me and my, for my liking,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is nothing I would buy from
greenhouse seeds because they sold many
[SPEAKER_01]: things as big bang.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're getting, it's not
necessarily skunk one, NL one and El Nino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it may have been skunk one,
NL one haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have been any number of things
that was sold as big bang because they
[SPEAKER_01]: would buy from places like buddha seeds,
not big buddha seeds, buddha seeds bang
[SPEAKER_01]: and buy bulk and use that for whatever
lines they had and just be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: these dipshits won't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no point in, um, preserving
stuff that you don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you really, really like it for
yourself, as far as preserving a strain
[SPEAKER_01]: for like the future, that's one of those,
those tough ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you like, it comes back to,
if you like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as far as preserving it for the
future, you'd be preserving something that
[SPEAKER_01]: we just don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing when you're working with,
with any of this shit lines or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: or you're making seeds or whatever,
like if you don't know what the fuck it
[SPEAKER_03]: is, like, I don't even want to work with
it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because it's, I mean, it is,
you don't know, you're shooting yourself
[SPEAKER_03]: in the foot from the get-go in a way,
or it feels like at least, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: as far as starting some kind of breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and not to even just say that it's
greenhouse, even though they're horrible,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, at doing this, you know, Barney's
farm, Nirvana, every one of them all did
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta be careful what we say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get knocked off the fucking YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I know who is doing the breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no one doing breeding compound
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's buying seeds from other white label
seed makers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some of the people he buys them
from, uh, early on, I'll even put this up
[SPEAKER_01]: on the fucking screen early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my buddy, why yeast was making the
seeds for him until he stole from white
[SPEAKER_01]: yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about Chris compound,
AKA tiger trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, that schmuck doesn't know shit
about shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go listen to his podcast and you'll see it
for yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's what he does burst people's
bubbles out there, but making seeds is
[SPEAKER_03]: easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, I've done it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did it in the fucking bathroom from
jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's mobile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pinky sent me shit into in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Must make one of my chem 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he made some crosses with that shit
and do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go buy some seeds, put them in a
mylar bag and sell them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the model.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised more people don't talk about
compound in the scams because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: scared of getting sued or they're
definitely not scared of him.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they've ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Met him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them dudes are so out of my
fucking spectrum of like what I should
[SPEAKER_01]: have never known this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got someone was going to hire us to
work with them, both of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is when why East still a part of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to spend a weekend and then
