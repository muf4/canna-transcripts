[SPEAKER_02]: Ready, go!
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Breeder Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Breeder Syndicate and today we
have CSI Humboldt and our co-host,
[SPEAKER_05]: Notso Dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope everyone's stoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be a good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to be talking today about
breeding goals.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so you want to take it away and run
with the topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, the last few episodes or
whatever, we've been chatting a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about like breeding history and various
aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked a little bit about terms and we
thought maybe it would be better to chat
[SPEAKER_00]: about something that's not talked about
too often, which is like, what are your
[SPEAKER_00]: goals when you take two things and you
cross them together?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you hoping that each parent might
give the children of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then talk a little bit about like sort
of the state of where things are and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's popular and methods and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, that's kind of where
we're going to bring it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, this is the first time we've
had three people on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super stoked that our buddy was willing to
come on and join us because he is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most prolific breeders that I know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has lots of experience of success,
failures, all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're pretty excited to have him on and
to be able to chat it up about this
[SPEAKER_00]: subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to kind of get
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe we'll talk about like,
for instance, Skittles for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Skittles comes out,
Skittles starts winning a bunch of awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Skittles crew held on to Skittles
pretty tight for a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get Emerald Cup and some different
other events.
[SPEAKER_00]: People buying hybrids of it was literally
the only way that they could get a hold of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one of the things that
drives breeding in some instances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something gets famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be Skittles, could be Cookies,
could be Kush, could be any number of
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then most people don't have access to
that cut because maybe it's hoarded or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the circles are still pretty tight
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the pricing and the desirability
for people to buy seeds of that thing
[SPEAKER_00]: become pretty high.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supply and demand, how it always works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supply and demand, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is driven, actually,
a lot of breeding because you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: offering up, you know, hey, you can't get
the cut, but maybe you'll find something
[SPEAKER_00]: in Skittles by TK that you'll like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that drives a lot of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of been like one of the
modern ways that people do things is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're mashing together a bunch of famous
cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and maybe Caleb can jump in on
this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, when you're looking at two
different things, right, if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to cross Skittles by this, what are you
hoping that maybe each parent might give
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds, might give the children that
you are excited about?
[SPEAKER_00]: When people cross things, what are the
ideas and what are the hopes behind what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're looking for each parent to give?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the traits they're looking or
their hopes for that the parent might
[SPEAKER_00]: give?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so one of the things that
one of the things that kind of I think
[SPEAKER_00]: separates CSI from a lot of other people
is that a lot of people cross things and
[SPEAKER_00]: never test them and they just release them
to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go back on CSI's page,
you can go back years and see him running
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses of his own hybrids for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that does is that actually gives
you an idea of what the parents you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using throw in their progeny and how they
breed, how they breed, which ones are
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent breeders, which ones are a mess
and are all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's some things out there
that it might be amazing clones that breed
[SPEAKER_00]: like crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they don't transfer the
qualities of the mother cut into its
[SPEAKER_00]: children very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so breeders naturally, when they find
things that work, they tend to go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, most people generally want what I
consider mythical plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want plants that are high yield,
high potency, extremely flavorful,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like you were talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they want everything in one
plant and not only one plant, but they
[SPEAKER_01]: want all the seeds to be everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not the reality of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like with your Skittles example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if I'm breeding with Skittles,
my goal is to take the best
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics of Skittles, which would
be the flavor and the smell, and hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporate that into something with
another desirable characteristic from the
[SPEAKER_01]: other parent, which would be maybe like
yield or potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's the other lines you've worked
with that you feel are special for
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding for your purposes?
[SPEAKER_05]: Say what?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's some of the other lines you've
worked with that you feel have special
[SPEAKER_05]: traits and characteristics that maybe
maybe they that breed true for it that you
[SPEAKER_05]: really enjoy, that you've found over the
years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I mean, you know, I love the love the
Urkels, the whole family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love Triangle Kush, you know,
OG Kush in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just, you know, a great
building block.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the chem family, you know,
which, you know, most people know my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just really chem 91 and
everything past that is a chem hybrid or
[SPEAKER_01]: polyhybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a delicate subject,
but I think that, you know, plants don't
[SPEAKER_00]: lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you've grown a lot of these chem
plants for a long time, and especially
[SPEAKER_00]: cross them and see what's in them,
it does seem that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the things that came from
me, but I don't think anybody has used it
[SPEAKER_00]: more than Caleb is the Mendo perps is
probably a good example, because the Mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: perps is it's fairly fast finishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got crazy colors in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got very unique terps, but it's
pretty low potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in regard, and so, you know,
one of the, you know, one of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that he released that, you know,
got a named cut was this Obama Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: where he married Mendo P to Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Bubba added a bunch of frost,
it added a bunch of structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: it added much more potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Mendo P seemed to add a lot
of pretty color and gave the Bubba some
[SPEAKER_00]: different unique smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the really good example of like
taking the strengths from one plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing it to something else where those
strengths or weaknesses, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, and then, you know,
there's things that, there's things that
[SPEAKER_00]: interest people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I always recommend people do when
they're breeding, because breeding is a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of work and it's time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a certain amount of failure
involved is if you have goals,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you're passionate about certain plants
you're using, then that to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the coolest kind of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're like, I want to take
these traits from this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to see if I can get these
traits and these traits from these two
[SPEAKER_00]: plants into one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, when you're passionate about
something, you know, as, as Caleb just
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, he just rolled through,
you know, favorites and he might be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to explain at length why each one of those
strains you know, why, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's probably a combination of traits
that he likes in each one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also probably a combination of
not only those traits he likes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they pass those traits onto the kids,
you know, pretty consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe you want to like,
one of the things you've told me in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past, Caleb, is that of a lot of the
things that you use, the Chem 91 seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: be one of the most consistent breeders for
adding potency to its progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, on that one, I also think
that, you know, and I've told you both
[SPEAKER_01]: this, you know, plenty of times,
I have a strong suspicion that I think the
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem 91 itself is an S1 from its original
source in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that might have something to do
with the, with the, you know, its
[SPEAKER_01]: propensity to pass on that strength
because it's, it's kind of like a
[SPEAKER_01]: bottlenecked S1 already, you know,
and you know, anytime you go, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: S1, S2, et cetera, et cetera, you know,
things I think are more stable and easier
[SPEAKER_01]: to pass forward as long as they're not
like a recessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's very consistent and up in the
potency on whatever you cross it to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whether it's you know,
feminized or regular seeds or whatever,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are some of the traits you like about
bubblegum?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that's one you use extensively and
your advice, I used it for the
[SPEAKER_05]: bubbleberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm super stoked on it, how it breeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I love the bubblegum cut because
it's one of the best plants I've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: grown outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just almost mold-proof, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's extremely frosty, has a sweet,
you know, bubblegum smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a nice all-around plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, does it, does it compare with
today's, you know, hypey stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Eh, probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, for, you know, somebody
who's farming outdoors and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for something, you know,
that's, you know, fairly stable and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, mold-prone or mold-proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, those are some of my
favorite characteristics of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the things that we
should probably mention too is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: so if you're really, if you're passionate
about breeding and you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: combine certain traits, I mean,
amongst us, you know, we might back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth a lot of different ideas and get
excited about a lot of random stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also this thing in the back of
your mind in which in order to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: successful breeder, people will have to
want to buy your stuff and have success
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these practical traits,
like you was just talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: great outdoor plant, highly
mold-resistant, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things can be really important,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, people want,
like as Caleb was mentioning earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: people want, buy a pack of seeds and that
to be the best growing, best yielding,
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest structure, crazy terps,
you know, super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want all the beans to be that way,
which is rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if, even if it had that,
but it molded like crazy, people would be
[SPEAKER_00]: pissed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so if you, if there's problems
inherent in a line, like high mold or
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodism or something else like that,
you can better believe that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to focus on that rather than this is
the most potent, flavorful, fastest
[SPEAKER_00]: growing thing I've grown in forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found four bananas and a couple of the
big, of the biggest colas rotted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I think it's a shit cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it makes it difficult,
you know, because there's a certain amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of commercial satisfaction that's
required, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And oftentimes it's the environment that
causes the problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, or, you know, I can't,
I can't even imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a, I'm not a public breeder,
but both Matt and Caleb are the amount of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the amount of responses they get
of like, Hey, these seeds didn't pop
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they died a few days after I cracked
them or they turned out like, like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I blame you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, most of the time,
sometimes, sometimes it is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the seed maker, but a lot of times
it's breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's user error.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never, I've never gotten any comments
like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine, everything's always perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's always perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, and we don't need to,
we don't need to name names or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's not the point of it,
but there was a super famous line that was
[SPEAKER_00]: released a number of years ago that was
very expensive and very hyped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that made it didn't even
bother to do a germ test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a germ test for people that don't know
is if you're a breeder, you take 50 or a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred or 200 of your seed and you pop
them a few times in paper towels or dirt
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That there's nothing funky and they
germinate well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's occasionally crosses you
make that don't germ well, forget about
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was, there was a line that
was released that they didn't even do a
[SPEAKER_00]: germ test on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people bought expensive seeds and
then 70% of them didn't even pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was so consistent that it wasn't
really user error because when you start
[SPEAKER_00]: getting just hundreds and hundreds of
complaints about the same issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, a germ test is something that takes,
you know, less than a week to really
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think causes a, you know,
poor germination rates like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, the, I mean,
Matt, you can speak to it if you want,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, what's it called?
[SPEAKER_05]: The sperm that's in the, uh, in the shell
might not be developed properly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wasn't getting proper food.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be minor cracks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all kinds of fucking reasons,
but some of it would probably be what
[SPEAKER_05]: recessive genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are calling it out in the comments
because it was obvious what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was candy rain and I'm not trying to
diss anyone, but one of the things,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the things that I was going to say
is that you can inbreed in cannabis more
[SPEAKER_00]: so than you can in other things a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but when you start inbreeding too much
and your, and your hybrids are a mishmash
[SPEAKER_00]: of the same four or five cuts over and
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over again, you will on occasion start
to get undesirable recessives or
[SPEAKER_00]: undesirable traits that pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those traits could be like some
mutant funky seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, yeah, but you know,
Caleb can talk about it too, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because he does a lot of S ones and he's
even done some S twos, but as you start
[SPEAKER_00]: going to S three, S four, S five,
things start getting significantly more
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants start getting way weaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: The germination rates become a lot
tougher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there's a real limit there,
uh, you know, in, in how far you can
[SPEAKER_00]: inbreed before you start to hit problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I haven't inbred that deep,
but, uh, Caleb, Caleb has a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more than I have in terms of
experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, uh, yeah, there's,
there's issues with inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can combine undesirable traits and
have them become a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even, even in S twos, uh, there's a lot of
plants that will not produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they won't, yeah, they won't
move forward when reversed, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, reversals, reversals
have become sort of the norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's flipped in this, in the sixties,
seventies, eighties, nineties,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the first decade of the two thousands,
uh, the, all breeding for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, was, was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we call regular breeding using males
and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, the only feminized breeding
that happened was typically accidental,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, hermaphrodism or something
along those lines, bag seeds, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, and then the revolution
happened, uh, you know, 13, 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 years ago, where the technology on how
to reverse cannabis became more well
[SPEAKER_00]: known.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I would say it's flipped and the
percentage of people that uses actual
[SPEAKER_00]: males is extremely low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vast majority of the seed game
today is feminized in some way,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's a really, it's a really
valuable tool, but as both of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, my co-hosts today can express,
uh, you know, we were joking before we
[SPEAKER_00]: came on live is that, you know,
when I use traditional males in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: my breeding, I never had a single breeding
failure, um, where when you reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: things, you can have failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have not very much pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have sterile pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have the pollen sacks not open,
and you have to go through a lot of manual
[SPEAKER_00]: labor to extract using screens and stuff,
the pollen from the pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, in the old days,
you have one male in a room, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: guaranteed you're going to pollinate the
entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and today, in today's world,
uh, you know, Caleb was just chatting
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might use 10 or 12, uh, females that
are marked for reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the hopes that a few of them are
pretty, you know, dump a lot and some,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of them dump some, and a few dump
a little, and then you've got a few
[SPEAKER_00]: failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so it's, it's, uh, it's pretty
difficult because it's not consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, people have great success
reversing a plant once and they do the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for whatever reason, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, uh, the, the, you know,
we have a lot of theories as to why,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, is the mix too strong or too weak?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a range of, of the mix that leads
to, you know, pollen dumping with some
[SPEAKER_00]: strains versus others, but it's mostly
like observational because we'd all don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have labs to really analyze why the
failure went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and, uh, you know,
it also leads to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in some cases, uh, you know,
people get mad at hermaphrodism,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's some plants that don't herm
and therefore they're a bitch to reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like I was telling you guys,
uh, you know, just, just a couple of days
[SPEAKER_01]: ago, I had to chop down a whole room at
four weeks flower because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I reversed eight, you know, nice big
bushes of old Betsy and none of them
[SPEAKER_01]: produced any pollen whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way I do things, I, I don't really
have a fallback a lot of the times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if it fails, I just have to chop a
whole room down and start over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the price of doing
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it old Betsy not reversing kind of
made me sad because she's one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite old girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so, you know, there's some,
there's some lines, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of
people, uh, that have tried to reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: various diesel and sour cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're notorious for not giving you
commercial viable amounts of pollen to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a bunch of people have had and
having really great results with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb's TK crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, Caleb can speak to this,
but I think he failed two or three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when he did even have success,
it was probably like a fifth of the
[SPEAKER_00]: success that he would normally have.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a good reversal.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, so there's, there's a lot of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a, there's, there's failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of, a lot of breeding failure used
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You breed something and then the progeny,
the children don't give you what you were
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in feminized breeding, there's a lot
of actual failure to fertilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that goes on even by extremely
experienced people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That do it all the time and for a living
and have real good techniques down and
[SPEAKER_00]: have done it a bunch and had a lot of
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'd like to add to though,
um, that when breeding feminized,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you tend to have a better idea of,
and in general, kind of more consistent,
[SPEAKER_01]: better results with your feminized,
you know, progeny than like a normal,
[SPEAKER_01]: a normal breeding where, you know,
you can observe certain things about a
[SPEAKER_01]: male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really can't see what it's going to
pass forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with the femmes, you, you know,
your girl on the left, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: your girl on the right, you know,
it does tend to kind of give you a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit better of a idea of what you're going
to get, you know, on that F1 hybrid,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, so like, if you were to talk
to breeders, say that we've been talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, you know, in the last few podcasts,
in the eighties and touch on the nineties
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff, I think most of them would tell
you that the most important, the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important plants they had in their rooms,
uh, were the consistent males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like once you found a consistent male back
then, you tended to cross it to everything
[SPEAKER_04]: because you were so stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a recent example would be,
you know, uh, Matt found a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was really happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was really happy with the,
with the traits that it passed onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and because males are so much harder
to find ones that pass the traits you
[SPEAKER_00]: want, they tend to get used over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to move on sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets really hard to move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, you have, you can look
at some of these old seed banks,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, Neville stuff or some
stuff in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they have a, they have a
handful of males, um, really a handful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they use those handful of males with
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, failure, you know,
failure and means that like you get
[SPEAKER_00]: something that the customer doesn't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just ends up being a big Ziploc
in your fridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, or you, you test
something out and you feel like it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: too many herms and it might affect your
reputation, even though you think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: good weed and you don't want to deal with
all the complaints out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ends up being a big Ziploc in your
fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe it'll be a project you
want to use later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, uh, one of the big
aspects of this that we want to chat about
[SPEAKER_00]: is that, you know, the term breeder is
used loosely, uh, and this isn't to diss
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone, but it encompasses basically
anybody that wants to cross and make
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's some people,
um, you know, there's not very many of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, uh, but both uh, Caleb and Matt are
two of them that they are actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: they actually do what I consider to be
traditional breeding in the sense that
[SPEAKER_00]: they take plants that they found from
previous breedings and they use them in
[SPEAKER_00]: further work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot, there's a, you know,
and everybody listening right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can have the power to affect breeding,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the breeding game right now is
crossing a lot of hybrids together and
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing them to the public with
absolutely no work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of breeders are crossing famous
things to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're giving them a sexy name and some
good packaging and they're releasing them
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're not actually popping them
themselves.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not doing any further work,
which is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then what happens is, is that when you
take somebody like, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb who runs a bunch of his own work,
he gets to see what varieties in my
[SPEAKER_00]: collection breed well and which ones
don't, which ones throw traits that I like
[SPEAKER_00]: and which ones are all over the place and
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that knowledge informs the next steps
you want to make a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so for instance, um,
you know, uh, Caleb has a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, they call T 1000, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, which is, uh, you know, it's,
it's a named cut from, uh, from one of his
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's Urkel and TK, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triangle Kush times purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triangle Kush times purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he found, you know, it was found in
hunts of that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I, I saw on his Instagram
and he's told me and stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's reversed that he's taken that cut and
he's used it in further work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of my, that was my,
one of my buddy, Tigard farm selection,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, from, you know, up there in Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, sometimes, sometimes it's
stuff you find in your own work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's stuff your buddies find in
your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, he, Caleb liked that one
enough that he's now doing further work
[SPEAKER_00]: within his own lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the most effective and the cheapest
and the most profitable way to grow seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, sadly, is to make the cross,
give it a name, give it some cool
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging and sell it and never do any
further work yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's a pretty profitable path.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other path, which is you test and you
grow rooms full of your own stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you try to look for traits amongst
that stuff that you want to keep working
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's a lot more sustainable
breeding, uh, because it gives you the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to, you know, uh, do multi-stage
breeding, which is real, what real
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding is really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's time consuming and it's
costly and it takes a while and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a goal in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, and in that regard,
and so, you know, I don't know if he's,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I don't know if you're,
are you selling, you're probably selling
[SPEAKER_00]: the T 1000 hybrids now, aren't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made them a while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, he's got, you know,
how many breeders out there are doing two
[SPEAKER_00]: or three or four step processes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's real breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at dog breeders or you look at
fish breeders or you look at corn,
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the idea that you just make
hybrids and sell them and never try to
[SPEAKER_00]: like advance in any way is not normal in
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most breeding has goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my favorite projects, you know,
that I'm working on now, um, are the S two
[SPEAKER_01]: projects where, you know, I've,
you know, grown out a hundred plus,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, plants of, you know,
at my S ones and made selections from
[SPEAKER_01]: those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm doing, I'm doing S twos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm doing back crosses to the moms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making hybrids between, you know,
S twos of the various, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, S ones like, you know,
taking the percol S one cross it to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, triangle coach or chem dog S one
and, you know, kind of making new versions
[SPEAKER_01]: of those same hybrids that I did with the
original parent cuts, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to be unique and hopefully a
lot more, you know, stable and uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, versus the previous generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of work, you know,
going into all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: New shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we could, you know, maybe one thing
we could talk about, and these are,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are also observations from Caleb,
but he's running out a bunch of,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, uh, chem 91 S ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we all think that it,
it already is an S one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what leads us to think that is the
lack of variability in the line,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It passes potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It passes looks that look very similar to
it, or there's a small range in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you kind of, you kind of get what
you get with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then he's also done a thing and I got
to go up and see it where he's reversed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Mendo P and he's grown out a
bunch of Mendo PS ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that has so much diversity in it
that, you know, he's made comments to me
[SPEAKER_00]: in the past where you could give out seeds
as ones of Mendo perps to various
[SPEAKER_00]: different people and they could make their
own selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lines would be extremely different
from one another because there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so much variation in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, you know, and then maybe we
should make a comment about S ones because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so many clone only elites and
there's not, um, there's not lines
[SPEAKER_00]: available of many of these things anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, most of the stuff that we hold,
uh, in our collections, you only have one
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting of that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have any sisters of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have any boys of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have any way to look within the
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the benefits, um,
of doing S ones with that kind of thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really the only way to look within
the genetic without another genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, genes coming in there and
altering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, so that's why we didn't know
how narrow the chem 91 gene pool was until
[SPEAKER_00]: he S one did and grew out a few hundred of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that it was narrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know how wide Mendo purple was
until you did that and grew out a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you were like, Oh my God,
there's a different stuff in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so S ones, S ones give people,
selfing gives people an ability to look
[SPEAKER_00]: through a line when they only have one
example, one female example of the line
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so it's one of the ways that
modern breeders get to save and preserve
[SPEAKER_00]: old lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of famous stuff that Caleb has
run recently, like Mendo purple or,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, snow or Trinity or chem 91 or,
you know, Urkel, or you go down the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't S one it, it's really
hard to see what's in it by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can out-cross it to other things and
you can see what traits that are dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: that pass to the children and out-crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you really want to look within a
line, um, most seed lines today,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, most clone only is are that
they're clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of these cuts, we'll start to
interrupt all of these selfing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there, there are all cuts that
are, you know, as you well know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Mendo purposes over,
you know, you sprouted that seed over 20
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and a lot of these cuts are 30,
40 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we don't, you know, stash away some
S one seed in that fridge, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: before it was too late, before those cuts,
you know, disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, we'll, we'll lose those genetics
on that tangent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to redo the, the,
the old bets?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to make another attempt at
it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see real old bull rider stock
pulled out of those S ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: My, my, my problem is, is I don't,
I have, I only have rooms that are three,
[SPEAKER_01]: four and six.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, um, it's hard doing some of
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had like some single light rooms
to do these things, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, cause then it wouldn't be so
much of an expense to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time, every time it fails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might be, that might be something
good to talk about is that it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing how much cool stuff we have to
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: These days, considering like most,
most normal breeders from other walks of
[SPEAKER_00]: life would laugh at the limited selection
pool we pull from, uh, how many plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many plants we get to run to make the
next generation selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, prohibition and things
like that have made a lot of breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: happen, especially in America inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inside means you have electricity,
you have a lot of lights, you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time, all this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most breeders have a million ideas
in their head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the ones that are passionate about it
and their ability to realize those ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: is quite limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, maybe you might have a
fridge full of, of ideas and passion
[SPEAKER_00]: projects and whatever, but most breeders,
you know, you have to sell enough stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: while you're doing your passion to fund
the passion part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, you know, when I was
doing a lot of breeding in the late
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties and early two thousands,
it was a terrible financial decision,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, because I wasn't selling any seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just giving it away to friends and
it was just for my personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then cannabis was super
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at least other people made money off
your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but whatever, but that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just the matter of, it's just the
matter of like most people back then
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't willing to take a four light or
when you could get, you know, when we'd
[SPEAKER_00]: was 4,500 a pound or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of getting six or eight pounds
of sellable cannabis out of that four
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter to get thousands of seeds that
you, you know, uh, you know, didn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: have an outlet for, um, you know,
and that's another thing that we should
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about too, for a second is the fact
that most seed breeding in America did not
[SPEAKER_00]: have an American outlet to be able to get
it to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot of private breeding
going on and there was a lot of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there was some passion going on
and different things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the public's asset access to it was
tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nineties and the, and the early
two thousands, which is when I did most of
[SPEAKER_00]: my stuff, I don't think there was American
small American seed companies that were
[SPEAKER_00]: getting it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would, you would have to make them
here, send them over to Europe and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they would have to send them back to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was companies like there was
companies, that's why like certain
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans partnered with Europeans do
worst decisions I ever made in my life
[SPEAKER_00]: over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, lots of American breeders think
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, I mean, for instance,
in the nineties, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the blueberry stuff, DJ short,
you know, he partnered with sag Martha
[SPEAKER_00]: first and then Dutch passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it doesn't sound like he was very
pleased with either one of those things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, you know, it, uh, it at least
allowed, if you didn't partner with
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody in Europe, nobody had access to
your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The forums changed it a little bit because
it at least allowed private DMS and some,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some low level trading and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even like, yeah, even Matt,
back in the day, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you, you would have a web address that had
the Netherlands that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll comment on that real quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in the day, I get this question all
the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only reason that I have a dot NL
address.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't because I was going to get more
traffic because of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously nobody types anything dot NL.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you live in the U S.
[SPEAKER_05]: But back then it was just a, just one more
step to keep people from looking at me in
[SPEAKER_05]: the U S.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and nowadays it's, it's irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's funny when people still Americans
use dot NL cause they think it's some kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of special thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but really, you know, the,
the IG era and you know, the forum,
[SPEAKER_00]: the forums a little bit, and then
Instagram and then loosening laws and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allowed a lot of very small time,
private breeders to be able to,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, to get out there, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there was some people back in the
day, 20 years ago, uh, when, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when Caleb and Shaw and some others,
and I first met, um, at some harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: parties and such, you know, the people
that were internet famous back then were
[SPEAKER_00]: like Vic high and, uh, DJ short and you
know, the, uh, the, you know, the brothers
[SPEAKER_00]: grim and the C 99 work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they, well, they got famous
because there was, there was such a,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was such a limited pool,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, it, you know, there was some,
there was a few Canadians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was a few Americans,
it got famous on the forums, but there
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't now it's like anybody can,
you know, can breed seeds in their closet
[SPEAKER_00]: or a bedroom or something, and they can
have an IG handle and they can get their
[SPEAKER_00]: work out there and they can spread their
work to friends and they can so test grows
[SPEAKER_00]: and people can see pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now it's become, it's become a lot
more common, but 20 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, uh, the vast majority of
breeders, I knew in Mendo and humble stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: were private.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had, if, unless you've met them,
you had no way of getting access to any of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, like zero, you know, if you were in
North Carolina or Illinois or Colorado or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, like you weren't
going to meet the people in the triangle
[SPEAKER_00]: or the people in Santa Cruz or the people
wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so I, you know, the combination of
reversals and the combination of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Instagram and some other forms
of communication really exploded.
[SPEAKER_00]: The small seed breeder in a way that it
never happened before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, I don't even know that,
you know, people would even know who CSI
[SPEAKER_00]: or riot would be without those two
innovations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still don't know who riot is,
but it's all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, we're, we're about,
let's see for, uh, 50 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to start doing some
questions that are, uh, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you want to start answering any,
Caleb, we could do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you want to talk any more on the
breeding topic, we could do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm okay with whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can tell you, dude, that,
uh, uh, questions for you predominate the
[SPEAKER_00]: questions this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll try to do every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, to be honest, yeah, even, even the
weeks that you're not here, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a bunch of stuff that people want
to ask for us to ask because they know
[SPEAKER_00]: you, um, so maybe, uh, you know,
let's see, let's talk about, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's a, here's a basic one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your very first cut and what,
what, what is one of the cuts that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could say you hold closest to your heart
amongst your current collection?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my very first cut, um, was a
Northern lights from my dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, he, he gave, he gave me that cut
in, in, uh, in 94.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I had that one all the way up
until I think 2002 and then stupidly lost
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, the, the, the closest thing
to that anymore is like chem number chem
[SPEAKER_01]: dog, number four, you know, that stuff is
very similar to the old Northern lights I
[SPEAKER_01]: got from my dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as far as favorites go, I always talk
about it, you know, just, just in case
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody has ever come across it,
but you know, my dad also gave me,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, around the same era, this Uriah cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, that one is still one of my
favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it might be possible to
recreate something like it with like,
[SPEAKER_01]: say a pine tar Kush, a bit of OG Kush,
and maybe something super, super just
[SPEAKER_01]: piney lemony, blah, blah, blah,
even more so than OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know, but, uh, as far as what
I have, uh, still, I mean, I love,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, the purple Indica that,
you know, my, my good buddy Fletch,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, got in the early 2000s and I'm
pretty sure that cuts dates back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, up there, up there in
Portland and Washington and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that one's, that one's extremely
unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, uh, you know, you're,
you know, I'm a fan of the purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I absolutely, you know, love Mendo
purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, uh, you know, uh,
you know, um, I've, I've had Urkel for
[SPEAKER_01]: damn near 20 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, she, she, she's,
she's a tried and true favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I lost any of those three,
I'd be a little bit upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's super simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, can you please confirm the timeline
for super skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I can it's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was released by Neville in the
final year that he owned the seed bank
[SPEAKER_00]: outright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so super skunk was released to the
public in the 1990, the seed bank catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he took a maple leaf Indica,
uh, which is supposedly called Afghan tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he crossed that to one of,
uh, Sam skunk man's skunk lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that put the funk back in the
skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it became a, it had a,
it had a great name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a great look, uh, became super
popular in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so super skunk was, uh, when people
talk about, oh, I had, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: mid eighties, super skunk or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that there wasn't skunk
aromas out there, but the actual super
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk name came about in the 1990,
uh, uh, seed bank catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this one is for Caleb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, do you feel that males have a place in
modern society?
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis breeding or reversals the
future and why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I absolutely do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm, I've never been one of those
types to rule out anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a place for feminized
seeds and, you know, feminized breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's just a value as
valuable a place for regular breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, I, I, I started out
doing just as much regular work.
[SPEAKER_01]: As feminized work, I just didn't really
capitalize on selling, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: much of the regular work because it kind
of just took an aside because you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: select out all those damn males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, the next question, I'm not
actually not going to have Caleb answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to make a joke about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's nothing against the,
it's a great question, but could Caleb
[SPEAKER_00]: please talk about interesting things he
learned from any or every line he self.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to wait for
Caleb's 10, 10 volume, uh, office on every
[SPEAKER_00]: line he's self because, uh, he's
constantly, uh, selfing things over the
[SPEAKER_00]: last 10 years or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's such a, that's a, that's,
uh, we could just talk for hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's just dozens of cuts that he's
done that too, at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little too wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a good question, but boy,
it really is a novel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I will say, I will say I take,
uh, pictures, um, and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they help with mental notes on more or
less every single S one I grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I think I'm headed up to about 2
million pictures strong as far as,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the, the S one has one pictures
are going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll ask this one again, because it got a
lot of votes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to try or continue to try to
reverse the Irene Kush?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you get, when you get 20 S
one seeds from half a half of a light,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, that's a little right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and also, I don't know if people
know, but, um, the, the Irene,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for half a thousand watt light
produced 20 seeds, but the, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the triangle Kush, uh, that got the side
pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: From that in the bed next to it produced
like 750 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the pollen was viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't pollinate itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and that's an interesting statement
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, um, even when people get viable
pollen, uh, there's some cuts out,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some cuts out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mac would be one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's some others that Matt could
talk about that you have viable pollen and
[SPEAKER_00]: it pollinates everything around it just
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't pollinate that female plant
very well at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plants that have very few pistols
on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pistols don't seem to be doing a
very good job of transferring that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that pollen grain to, um, where it needs
to go to fertilize the egg and create a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there's some interesting stuff in
that, uh, this is another really good
[SPEAKER_00]: question for Caleb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, uh, it's pretty valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested to hear inspectors speak on
growing large populations in relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: small spaces.
Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, ideally I like to do no more than
36 plants per light when I'm growing large
[SPEAKER_01]: populations of like feminized seeds out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'll do that in a four to
six K room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'm, I'm doing a hundred to
200 plants generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it just, it just gives you a better,
better idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what's in that genetic pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have done like single light,
you know, rooms where I pack in like 80
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, you know, under the one light and
I flower them out, you know, at,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, four or six inches tall,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I mean, you know, for,
for anybody limited on space, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's an excellent way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, especially if you're doing them in
like small six inch pots where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you can make selections out of
that larger pool, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, then you can pull them out and,
you know, um, you know, re-veg them and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, actually have, you know,
have fairly heavily selected stock to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you don't have to grow your
plants out in a five gallon pot or 10
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon pot or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to grow them big to know
what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, if you're looking for
potency, uh, smell, flavor, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, any of the, the really main
criteria, you don't need just big plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you're expecting them for
structure or hemp, maybe you need a little
[SPEAKER_01]: more room, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll add to that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Caleb has a little bit different style
than I do in the, in that he grows,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, small seed plants like that,
fairly tightly packed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just so people know when he's talking
about doing 36 plants a lot, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: that generally it's, it's on like a,
a slight, you know, one of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, old tables, like a four and a half by
four and a half kind of area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so it's kind of a six, it's kind of a
six wide, you know, six deep type of
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're, I used to do it slightly
differently than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would, I would grow out a bunch of
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take cuttings from that seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, as soon as multiple cuttings and
rooted, I would ditch the seed itself
[SPEAKER_00]: because I found when you were growing
regular stuff, the seed energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to know what it did as a
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to know what it did as a clone,
because sometimes that can be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to see its growth structure
as a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and what he mentioned is, is that when
you grow up things too big and you flower
[SPEAKER_00]: them and all of a sudden you get 10 or 12
pounds or something and you have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: books, uh, or at, or average, not every,
not everything is, is a, is a home run,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, even among the lines that
produce great plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a lot of, you know,
and so then you end up with a lot of ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would do is somewhat similar to
him in that I would throw away the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and then I would pack tables with,
you know, four to six inch tall cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would flower the cut because as
Caleb just mentioned, if I got a half
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce or three quarters of an ounce or an
ounce off a plant, and I got to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: the cola looked like there, that's all I
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, and you, you, you would get
enough of the turps, you'd get enough of
[SPEAKER_00]: the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could, you know, if you have a
quarter, seven to 10 grams to smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll give you enough indication that
you need to, um, that you can go back and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow some of those selections,
uh, in a, in a larger, in a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario, grow more of them, grow them
bigger, see their, see their, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that way, if you get a bunch of
bunk, it's only five to 14 grams a bunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Per per plant, you know, and you get
enough and that's what you need to start
[SPEAKER_00]: doing in order to really run through
numbers, uh, in that regard and have it
[SPEAKER_00]: only take up so much space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other issue that happens and,
you know, I have a different method than
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb, but it's a universal problem is
when you start growing out large numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: to test and you don't want to lose
something, you end up needing to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: backups of the things you're flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't lose them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's basically two methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either keep backups, which is time
consuming and takes up a bunch of space in
[SPEAKER_00]: your veg, or you can start pulling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow in pots, you could start
pulling out small pots of things that you
[SPEAKER_00]: think are amazing when they're only part
of the way through flowering and then
[SPEAKER_00]: revert.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a European method and kind
of, and start reverting them back to veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, but you know,
it's, you know, it's a real issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, because you know, it's happened to
Caleb talks to me about it all the time is
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, uh, you know, I grew a
room of 240 plants and my two,
[SPEAKER_00]: my three favorites, two of the cuttings
didn't make it by the time I realized it
[SPEAKER_00]: was my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so trying to save copies
that you can go back and actually deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with and the space involved is a real pain
in the ass for lack of a better way to put
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it takes up, you know, you want to do
a big hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to keep that thing around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you got a big batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I fully agree with not so on,
uh, taking cuts off of the seed plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: growing the, the cut, the cuttings versus
the seed plants, because seed plants will
[SPEAKER_01]: never give you an accurate representation
of what that clone is going to become past
[SPEAKER_01]: the seed stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's really, I fully agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason to grow the seed plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's themselves when you're just
selecting for future, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, clone stock, that's going to
give you the best clones don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: taproot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be lankier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have some more life energy in
different ways and them than the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since you only get one shot at the
seed, that's why a lot of people like back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the day would want to grow seed outdoor
because the vigor contained within a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: plant would give you, could give you a
larger plant, a bigger plant than a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's some famous clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my Maui cut does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue dream does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, green crack does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some famous clones that despite
being clones will give you huge plants
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you went back to the two 15 era,
five or six years ago, a lot of the big
[SPEAKER_00]: giant gardens you would see on Instagram,
uh, in terms of outdoor were all seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got an eight or nine foot tall
root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Room with, you know, a thousand watt
lights or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden you got some seed
energy and the thing wants to be seven
[SPEAKER_00]: feet tall and you're doing bending and
trellising and corralling of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a huge pain in the ass,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's the, you know,
Caleb actually has had a pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: method of taking clones off of plants when
they're a couple of weeks into bloom,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, which a lot of people wouldn't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but in that regard, it, it,
they, the plants kind of freak out for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while because they're into flower,
but that's actually a benefit because one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the things you're trying to do when
you're keeping clones in a different room
[SPEAKER_00]: for veg is you want to keep them kind of
small until you figure out which ones are
[SPEAKER_00]: worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there might, you might have 180
clones and like, you only care about six
[SPEAKER_00]: of them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know which, you don't know which
six.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they're, when they're in flower,
it takes, uh, you know, a good month,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe even six weeks or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before they start vegging out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you buy yourself some time keeping them
in those flats.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, we actually just took a 12 flats of
clones this week of TK ABC F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yippee skippee to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I should mention just
because Caleb's told me about it a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: is that when you start judging plants on
growth and structure and weight and frost
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that, those are good things to
judge on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of the times, uh, he finds out
his favorites end up being some shitty ass
[SPEAKER_00]: run, uh, that wasn't very impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't look very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't very happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never thought much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, him and his crew end
up testing it, which is actually the part
[SPEAKER_00]: that matters at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, Oh man, this is special,
but you never would have thought it was
[SPEAKER_00]: special growing because it just looked
like a, it just looked like a run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like it was odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had funkiness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have the greatest bud structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course that's going to be like
the tastiest one with the best time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a huge fan of runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, you know, I would say too that
we could mention this because,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, he laughed about it,
but really if you look at like Caleb's
[SPEAKER_00]: work with freak show, or you look at the
ABC or you look at, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: runs, and things like that, like what he's
really talking about is like, he's a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: fan of outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a huge fan of things that are
abnormal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that pop up in a population that
might be rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that, you know, uh, might not be
that common, but then it popped up and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, Oh, look at that little
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what direction could I take
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And strangely, you know, we should mention
this too, is that, so I'll, I'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stretch it out a little bit,
but if you go into the store, any
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable you buy in the store,
whether it's a tomato or a zucchini or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever else, that thing has been picked
to grow because it yields well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for instance, let's take a tomato,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important thing for a tomato for
tomato growers is weight color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the skin break?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it rot in transit?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all these, can you stack it in
transit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it bruise easily?
[SPEAKER_00]: All these factors are huge taste and
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And texture are way down on the list.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole reason why heirloom tomatoes
made a comeback is because these things
[SPEAKER_00]: actually taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where when people were growing things for
production, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, zucchini, anything, you name it,
they're grown because the producer,
[SPEAKER_00]: it, it grows well for them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces a lot for the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is pretty unique in that the
stuff that becomes really popular became
[SPEAKER_00]: really popular because consumers enjoyed
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one would ever in a million years pick
any kind of OG Kush as a production plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viny, small buds doesn't hold itself up a
pain in the ass to grow a weak root
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those things would prevent you from
ever seeing it in most normal agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: because they would eliminate it because it
didn't have the qualities needed to be put
[SPEAKER_00]: to scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: People would want every, you'd get blue
dream, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a fast growing, vigorous
thing that yields a ton, doesn't take that
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so cannabis is a bit unique in that
even like something like sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, sour diesel is kind of tricky to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of people find it finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have too many bud sites on sour
diesel, it'll give you a lot of feathery
[SPEAKER_00]: almost wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, there's a lot that goes on
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of very famous strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That have really, really crappy production
traits, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The pump, you know, all kinds of things,
you know, um, you know, and so,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so there's the, you know,
Matt way earlier in the thing was talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about root structure, which is not a very
bread for trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's certain plants that you grow
in the same room that some plants drink
[SPEAKER_00]: like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll use OG Kush as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of OG Kushes have typically weak
root systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't grow vigorous root systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, they can only drink so
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, they only grow so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's a consideration too,
is that cannabis has been, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you guys a funny story really
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Skittles first came out, uh,
Skittles is notorious for growing slow,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Caleb and I had, had a mutual friend
that made an IG post where he was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in, in October, he's like,
I'm edging these Skittles for my next
[SPEAKER_00]: year's light depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they'll be three, hopefully
they'll be three feet tall in six months,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where Skittles might be like winning
awards for its turps and winning awards
[SPEAKER_00]: for its extracts and everything else,
but try to get the thing higher than four
[SPEAKER_00]: feet tall outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a slow growing bushy little hedge of
a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my point to that is that most of
the famous strains that people like either
[SPEAKER_00]: for their turf profile or they're high,
wouldn't make the cut in normal
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture because they don't have the
growth traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really, really difficult because
that's what I was, that's what made me
[SPEAKER_00]: think of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was joking about Caleb's love for
runts is that a lot of times the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the freak, the mutant, the one that grew
short, the one that was a pain in the ass
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the one that tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that will get people
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one that was like five feet tall
and three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that grew huge colas all over it
and grew like a champ and barely required
[SPEAKER_00]: any work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one ends up being a little bit more
boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, man, I wish I could merge
those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can talk about that for a
minute, Caleb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear the biggest, biggest girls,
at least biggest feminized girls I grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: they always seem to have a little
persuasion to hang in the balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've noticed that,
but the big girls.
[SPEAKER_05]: Women say that about me all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a question for both of you that,
that I'll follow up with on after,
[SPEAKER_05]: after I asked you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Hayes brothers and me and Caleb
actually talked about this yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think me and me and not so talked
about it a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know crybaby was a part of that Hayes
brothers, vintage California Kush 1980s
[SPEAKER_05]: picture in high times in the 79 issued,
they talk of a new hybrid known as USH
[SPEAKER_05]: Kush in NorCal across between Hawaiian
hash plant and tie, specifically calling
[SPEAKER_05]: it Kush by 79.
[SPEAKER_05]: They already knew of Hindu.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what the fuck is this Cali Kush?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it pure Kush?
[SPEAKER_05]: The picture does look like the Malibu in
the article.
[SPEAKER_05]: They straight up say Afghani skunkweed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been driving me crazy for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Caleb, anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can make a couple of general
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kush is a general term, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a huge mountain range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the second tallest mountain range in
the world next to the Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it runs through Afghanistan and
Pakistan down to the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's called the Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we talked in a previous
podcast about how names are relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back in the day, people talked about
people named things per their region of
[SPEAKER_00]: origin, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Hawkin mentioned Siwa Khan,
Panamanian, Hawaiian, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: various, various aspects like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They rarely had names that weren't
regional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kush could literally be anything
collected from the Hindu Kush mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Hindu Kush mountains could be as
low as one or 2000 feet above sea level
[SPEAKER_00]: and as high as five, six, seven,
eight thousand above sea level and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these big valleys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and then secondly to that,
and what he's probably really asking is
[SPEAKER_00]: that there are a few plants that popped up
and became famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody mostly knows the story,
but if they don't, there's a Bubba Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: line and there's a Kush line that has
various origin stories, but is most likely
[SPEAKER_00]: a mix of Northern Californian and European
genetics that popped up in Florida,
[SPEAKER_00]: came to LA, became a craze.
[SPEAKER_00]: People got extreme amounts of money for it
and then it became very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what most people today know is
Kush, you could classify as TK or Ghost or
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what most people know because
that's what became popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's been traded on forums and
traded on IG and everybody else and bought
[SPEAKER_00]: in clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what most people today know
of as Kush, but that's a lot narrower of a
[SPEAKER_00]: gene pool than shit that came from the
Hindu Kush.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go all the way back to Hindu,
you go back all the way back to 1979 and
[SPEAKER_00]: you have Matt and I might do a short about
this soon about the hippie hashish trail,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you have some, you have some euros or
you have some Americans come back from
[SPEAKER_00]: India, Nepal, Kashmir, you know,
Pakistan or Afghanistan, and they bring
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds back to their buddy and they're from
Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: What date was that article from again?
[SPEAKER_01]: 79?
[SPEAKER_05]: 79 issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: They talked of a new hybrid known as Kush.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, remember I was telling you
how they were hating on Humboldt back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the seventies, I think it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was probably that same issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all bitter, you know,
that Humboldt's all popular because of
[SPEAKER_01]: their Indicas or their Kushes,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they were upset that their
hazes, you know, were getting downplayed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, like we've talked plenty
of times back in 78, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was roughly the year that pretty much
it seems like everybody around Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Trinity, all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a huge influx, you know,
of purple Kush seed, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and obviously just like not so was talking
about that's that's just Hindu Kush seed
[SPEAKER_01]: and the purple, of course, the purple
pheno or purple genotype of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm almost wondering if they didn't
just get a hold of some of some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: seed and incorporate it into their hazes
to kind of, you know, up their market
[SPEAKER_01]: value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is very possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I could add to that is that
in modern breeding today, that same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: holds true, which is a cut becomes famous
and everybody breeds that cut into
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the last 15 years, the amount of
people that have used cherry pie,
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl Scout cookies, five or eight
different Kush cuts, Gittles, you saw you
[SPEAKER_00]: name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it became famous and desirable,
people would blend it into everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things, you know,
you see people out there that are like
[SPEAKER_00]: pumping up their various hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, some of the stuff you see
Caleb do that people might be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, why the hell is he working with ABC?
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's funky freak shows fucked up,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why the fuck you messing around with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it is like, honestly, with the
amount of work that's been done with
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry pie and cookies and Kush,
what new and exciting do you think is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to pop out of that that someone
hasn't already done in the last 10 years?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you take two hybrids that are
mostly a mishmash of those things all
[SPEAKER_00]: smashed up together, I'm not dissing
crossing kushments with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are you going to find that's not
something that's already somewhat similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to a lot that's out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to find novel and new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people people have been ever,
ever since the name game came around,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ever since popularity came around,
like Caleb was just mentioning,
[SPEAKER_00]: people might be crossing these Afghans to
their hazes to increase its popularity,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been doing that for the last
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's increased dramatically in the
last 20 years, where it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there was a I mean, this is a
funny example, but there's no Kush in
[SPEAKER_00]: Blackberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In this sense that Kush, for the most
part, like the reason why people added
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush to Blackberry Kush was because people
wanted to buy Kush, you know, sour gets
[SPEAKER_00]: added to a lot of names or diesel gets
added to a lot of names or names get
[SPEAKER_00]: changed because there's a desire to sell
certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the desire to feed that market
either makes a lot of breeding happen
[SPEAKER_00]: around a few select cuts, and you're
trying to get a hybrid that you can call
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's a famous, there's a
there's a good cut up here called Doc's
[SPEAKER_00]: OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that it's it's not the
greatest guy that doesn't have very much
[SPEAKER_00]: OG flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have very much in the way of,
you know, the the high that I like,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it looks like a traditional Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it yields like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then people are going to grow it
because it produces well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can call it Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm looking for Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, I have a ton of Kush here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy this Doc's Kush.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happens.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, and I'm not even trying
to diss them or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is that is that, you know,
these names get added on to things because
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as it's desirable and easy to buy,
for instance, you know, Caleb has become
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty famous with his Urkel crosses in
0405 0607.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that you know, eventually
there was probably literally thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers in Mendo and Humboldt that had
lavender, Urkel, grape ape, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half a dozen of these different cuts to
meet the purple craze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the purple craze phased into
the sour craze and the Kush craze and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cookie craze and the Skittles craze,
it ends up like there's like six dudes
[SPEAKER_00]: that held on to the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 15 years ago, how many people did you
know in Humboldt that had some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was popular and a lot of buyers
wanted it, which means lots of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: produced had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as the market shifted,
so did the holding of the cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before that, before that, it was
Salmon Creek, Big Bud and train wreck and
[SPEAKER_01]: snow and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what happens is, and this is sort
of the thing is that when things are
[SPEAKER_00]: popular, everybody has it and everybody
wants it and people want it from their
[SPEAKER_00]: friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as it becomes unpopular,
the percentage of people that are willing
[SPEAKER_00]: to hold on to old cuts when there's no
financial value to it becomes tiny.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, then you have a bunch of
people, you know, now we have a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff going on in the community where most
people, there's legendary strains that
[SPEAKER_00]: very few people relative to today have
actually seen or smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so fakes proliferate because they get
passed around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe the person passing it around
doesn't even realize it's a fake because
[SPEAKER_00]: he never had it in 1998.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he doesn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so he's passing it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, oh, I think I am real snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to trade you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he doesn't have snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was real snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was given to me by my buddy who's had
it for forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he swears it's real snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you talk to somebody like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Caleb or whoever who actually grew snow
back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, someone who's held it for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snow is a bad example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen a fake cut of snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, yeah, it might have been a bad
example, but like maybe maybe the Trinity
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a better example or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an excellent example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that might be an act because people
will get mad at me because they would give
[SPEAKER_00]: me their Trinity and they'd be like,
oh, man, I gave up the farm for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'd smoke it and I'd be like,
it's not even a hybrid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what I did to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, dude, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's some cuts where it's like,
I mean, one of the things I have no idea
[SPEAKER_00]: what sour cut I hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I lost it, I've collected six or
seven or eight different sour cuts in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last four or five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of them are the cut that I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means that if I lost it,
me trying to find it again would be would
[SPEAKER_00]: be would be shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what happens to a lot of old
cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get arguments about whether
it's real or whether it's not real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a group of collectors,
you know, there's three of them on this
[SPEAKER_00]: call right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's not that many people that are
willing to hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a joke of give me your old and
unpopular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, having a big mom room
is a huge pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of trying to keep plants
healthy and bug free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of and then, you know,
98 percent of it isn't commercially
[SPEAKER_00]: viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're holding on to it for preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're holding on to it for maybe some
future breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're holding on to it because most of
the stuff that I hold, I hold it because I
[SPEAKER_00]: personally like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the determining factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what the public thinks,
but most people you know, it's they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the will or they just want
to hold what's currently popular because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what works for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they think, oh, I know this is this is
how everything gets lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can always get it back from my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to chime in real quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we get way too far from the
question of the California Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was actually given the seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's way far from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we were way far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whoever's question it was, we got real
far afield there for a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you do when you're a fucking
nerd.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a nerd now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was given seeds by a guy that was on the
forums named Walking Man.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people that were around back in
the day knew him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I sat on these seats for a long time and
they were labeled Hayes Brothers,
[SPEAKER_05]: California Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason I sat on them is because I
was like, what the fuck is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: California, Hayes Brothers, they're
fucking Hayes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so I sat on them for a long time
until I came across a high times issue
[SPEAKER_05]: that I have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was going through it and I see Hayes
Brothers, California Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, what the, you know,
and by this time, Walking Man's,
[SPEAKER_05]: Walking Dude's Dead, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm trying to figure out, you know,
what are in these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did pop them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did run them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say the closest thing they
look to is what I would associate having
[SPEAKER_05]: grown with Hindu Kush before.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're stretchier.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not like OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: The buds, the buds are dense.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're smaller, more golf ball,
more spread.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's stretchier.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is where the OG connection probably
ends with the California Kush that I have
[SPEAKER_05]: grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, are they the original ones from the
Hayes Brothers?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they were labeled,
but we did F-Gen those and let them out
[SPEAKER_05]: just in case.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you need to grow them so you can
answer the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty funny is, uh, Caleb,
why, when are you going to come back and
[SPEAKER_00]: why did you make everyone wait so long to
come on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll answer that one for him is,
uh, he is real busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, he's got a lot of stuff
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of being really a prolific breeder is
that that's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's a lot of work to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of work to run rooms and have
things come down and catalog and take the,
[SPEAKER_00]: what did he mention?
[SPEAKER_00]: The 20 million pictures that he has on
file and answer and answer, be responsive
[SPEAKER_00]: probably on his website and deal with life
and family stuff and eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I haven't responded on the website for
about three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apologies to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets, it gets difficult,
especially if you're a one man show and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, and you're holding on and you're
trying to do a lot of actual work and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to have a life and
friendships and families and different
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're really appreciative that he gave
us some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he's like one of our really close
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we chat like this all the time
about things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and, uh, one of the,
one of the, one of the aspects that Matt
[SPEAKER_00]: and I are trying to do is that some of the
most knowledgeable people are not great at
[SPEAKER_00]: self promotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and there's a lot of people
who are really good at self promotion and
[SPEAKER_00]: not that much great at everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Caleb's kind of the reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he's really, really good at
observation and breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has a long history of plants and
he's definitely a weed nerd and has a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of knowledge in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, public speaking and
making the time for this kind of thing can
[SPEAKER_00]: be relatively hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, so, um, you know,
we're super appreciative that he came on
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're hoping that we'll be able to
occasionally get them to pop back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say, you know, uh, be thankful
he's here and let's hope that he liked it
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, we'll get some other subjects
that interest them enough that he'll pop
[SPEAKER_00]: back on.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need to do some housekeeping.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, for Caleb's, anybody who's interested
in grabbing Caleb seeds, I've seen a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of comments about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find them on speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could find them on his website and he
has a lot of other retailers.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your website, Caleb?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're interested in HumboldtCSI
.com, I know speakeasy has got a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: great stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have our Patreon.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can join our discord via Patreon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we go in there chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I think we're doing movie night
tonight.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're fucking sit and watch movies
together or TV shows, just dick around.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we also talked about cannabis stuff
extensively.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put a lot of my catalogs online and a
lot of my, uh, collection of historical
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So pretty much anybody can access that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a part of our Patreon and I'm putting
up nudes of Caleb in the same folder
[SPEAKER_05]: tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two things real quick,
just cause I see questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see multiple questions about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I gave my, uh, my headband cut to
Caleb to breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's already released a few lines off
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, it's not very well spread out in
the community yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so since he's so prolific at breeding,
uh, and he has such a customer base,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, my main goal was to get it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's done some Chem D he's done some
TK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's, you know, there's potential
more work that he's going to do with it as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as it ends up being worthwhile and he
likes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so that's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then someone asked them some questions
about Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, Mexico is super close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, unfortunately, uh, the Mexican,
uh, the Mexican weed is controlled a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: by cartels and there's a lot of violence
associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not so much like the seventies
anymore where you can kind of go down
[SPEAKER_00]: there and like hang out with regular
farmers and maybe get seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit more sketch than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the violence has been quite extreme
for the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so.
[SPEAKER_00]: While Mexico does have a large and diverse
population of cannabis down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope that, uh, some more of it
comes our way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as simple as it was decades ago
to go down there, despite how close it is
[SPEAKER_00]: and poke around and get access to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything really worth, um, getting in
Mexico anymore, just with the influx of,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, European genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hardly doubt it, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cartel would have been trying to increase
production at some point.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they're not, they're not stupid.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's their main export other than meth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might, so that might be something
just real quick that we'll end it on is
[SPEAKER_00]: that, uh, sadly, one of the, you know,
I, I talked about how it's very difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: for us to penetrate Afghanistan and
Pakistan these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be a benefit, um, because it's
keeping their lines a bit more pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some of the European lines have
infested Jamaica, infested Mexico,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, Morocco, and some of these other
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these regions have been,
you know, have, you know, some of these,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Morocco, especially cause it's
close to Europe, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: they used to have a lot of traditional
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of different European seed
banks got super lemon haze now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff like that, that they bring down
there and breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there's a lot of regions of origin
that have been polluted for better or for
[SPEAKER_00]: worse, uh, by these other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not going to go to Jamaica and
find some 25 week lamb's bread anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to, it's not as easy to
find stuff in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as easy to find stuff in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's part of the issue is that the,
you know, global trade has good and bad
[SPEAKER_00]: parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the sixties and seventies,
a lot of these regions were untouched and
[SPEAKER_00]: they just had what they had from their
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's been a lot of cross
contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, yeah, you know, no one's going
to Morocco looking for super lemon haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: but sadly that's what they might find,
you know, or they might find some LA
[SPEAKER_00]: confidential or whatever over there,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and because those farmers,
