[SPEAKER_02]: I started, I ended, I killed, was offended
Got people and put their hands up up in my
[SPEAKER_02]: navel and mouth On my way to save the
world On my way to save the world Got a
[SPEAKER_02]: brand new set of words and they're growing
great and cheap I'm gonna stop for a
[SPEAKER_02]: second questioning fully The words
condescend, just in one sharp and blunt
[SPEAKER_02]: What's inside my wrist just doesn't stop
to do a buzz I started, I ended,
[SPEAKER_02]: I killed, was offended Got people and put
their hands up up in my navel and mouth On
[SPEAKER_02]: my way to save the world
[SPEAKER_00]: On my way to save the world Come on in,
yeah, come on in.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you tell me about that line?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that's what a striking picture on
the site.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, yeah So, I mean the one thing to
bear in mind is like Purple color,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's very common in cannabis I
think precisely for the reasons you're
[SPEAKER_03]: saying you like it people just do like the
color and it's really quite typical to
[SPEAKER_03]: find populations that with one land race
where like, you know half of the
[SPEAKER_03]: population or whatever is Purple,
half is green.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Kamauni is definitely, and the same as
with Highland High, so like Kamauni
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely like I don't know actually what
percentage it would be, but I mean I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: sure it's controlled by some alleles or
whatever, but of any field of a typical
[SPEAKER_03]: Kamauni field would there be like,
you know, a percentage of them will be
[SPEAKER_03]: purple plants Sometimes that's temperature
related and Kamauni, okay, so that's a
[SPEAKER_03]: very different type of plant from the
Highland High.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Kamauni is like a multi-purpose
Himalayan land race that's for fiber and
[SPEAKER_03]: for culinary seed and hand rubbed for
hash, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not intended for producing sinsemila.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no culture of that at all in the
Himalayas, in that area of the Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going to again break down into type
one, type two, type three chemotypes I
[SPEAKER_03]: would expect if you actually looked at the
fields and so some plants will be useless
[SPEAKER_03]: for smoking as bad and then others you
could begin a breeding project with to
[SPEAKER_03]: bring them up to being like strong type
one if you actually wanted to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think generally the males are what's
primarily used for fiber production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like these days like most people don't
actually in the village do the work of
[SPEAKER_03]: like retting the hemp and like turning it
into cordage or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be like a hundred plus years
ago that most people in the Himalayas
[SPEAKER_03]: would wear clothes made out of hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd make shoes using hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd tether all their livestock using
hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cordage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it was a really crucial plant for them
at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, one of these sort of social
status considerations that comes into play
[SPEAKER_03]: around cannabis is that having clothes
that were made from Himalayan hemp was a
[SPEAKER_03]: marker of not being like a high class
person in the Himalayas, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, typical, you know, kind of situation
where you have the original community of
[SPEAKER_03]: the Himalayas that we're doing would be
using hemp as their primary textile plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you have waves of immigration coming
up from the plains of kind of Hindu
[SPEAKER_03]: Brahmins and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have this kind of class
distinction that gets made between people
[SPEAKER_03]: who wear cotton clothes and people who
wear hemp clothes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so even in Khmer today, like,
you know, there's a if you look in the old
[SPEAKER_03]: 19th century stuff, there was a specific
kind of Kamauni curse or, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like sort of a swearing type phrase that
basically said, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope hemp grows all around your house,
basically, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a marker of being of a lower status
group.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the Khas or Khasavarya would be the
people who were associated with growing
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp and still do primarily do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: People would call them like Pahari or
Pahadi or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be the mountain local people who
mostly grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen friends of mine up there who
are from the more kind of landowner
[SPEAKER_03]: aristocratic type communities who I
sometimes would like have like bags of
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds I collected whilst I was staying at
their guest houses and stuff and would
[SPEAKER_03]: just kind of, you know, be chucking them
around the place on the off chance they'd
[SPEAKER_03]: germinate and they'd always like make a
point of like killing any of the seedlings
[SPEAKER_03]: because they just it wasn't even a legal
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like they're too posh to have
this growing around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's like really, you know,
it's it's a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, so Kamauni is like that type of
plant, essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know to what extent there might be
spiritual or kind of sacramental use
[SPEAKER_03]: associated with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But definitely if you go into some of the
Shiva temples, you will see like people in
[SPEAKER_03]: Kamauni who will offer, you know,
flowers of cannabis to Shiva and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: along with Datura and these kind of
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's definitely a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how old it is, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of these areas would have
been Buddhist if you went way back,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, before they were Hindu and some
of them would have been kind of animists,
[SPEAKER_03]: like kind of worshipping some gods and
stuff like possibly kind of Iran,
[SPEAKER_03]: Scythian type connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go into the temple in Kamauni,
like you can see the sun gods often have
[SPEAKER_03]: like these calf length kind of riding
boots, you know, which you don't see on
[SPEAKER_03]: any other kind of deities in the Hindu
pantheon.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the solar gods who definitely have a
connection to the Iranic kind of Central
[SPEAKER_03]: Asian cultures have these riding boots,
you know, which could be a connection to
[SPEAKER_03]: Scythian culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love I love learning about that specific
culture like Syrian, Sumerian,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Scythian, Scythian, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's the one ancient culture
where there's a very definite undeniable
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis connection, you know,
like obviously with Herodotus and the
[SPEAKER_03]: finds in the Pamirs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Altai, which are all unequivocally
Scythian like archaeology in the burials
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff, the materials.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's also the 500 BC ish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a, you know, so these are a
kind of culture zone of the Scythians
[SPEAKER_03]: really like went all the way from the
frontiers of China all the way to the
[SPEAKER_03]: frontiers of Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you've got the documentation
from Herodotus north of the Black Sea and
[SPEAKER_03]: what's sort of Ukraine and southern Russia
saying, yeah, these people are fumigating
[SPEAKER_03]: with cannabis, that's kind of 450 BC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you've got the very, very closely
dated sort of 400 BC ish, 450 BC ish finds
[SPEAKER_03]: in Pazirik and the Altai that are Scythian
where they actually have the tripod type
[SPEAKER_03]: kit exactly as described by Herodotus,
even though it's like thousands of
[SPEAKER_03]: kilometres east.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's again, Scythian territory.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you've got that's in Pazirik and the
Altai.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just south from there,
a few thousand kilometres, you've got the
[SPEAKER_03]: finds in the eastern Pamirs just near
Xinjiang of the fumigation devices,
[SPEAKER_03]: which again, definitely Scythian based on
the material in the burials, which have
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis all over them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then possibly you've got Stavropol as
well, which is southern Russia just north
[SPEAKER_03]: of the Caucasus, which again is Scythian
where you've got like cannabis and opium
[SPEAKER_03]: on these drinking vessels is probably what
they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, 400, 500 BC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got four kinds of finds,
which you can say, yeah, these are
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely Scythian and they're spread
right across the Scythian culture zone in
[SPEAKER_03]: the Iron Age.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then during that period, to get it
back to command during that period,
[SPEAKER_03]: you had the expansion of the Achaemenid
Empire, which was essentially a Scythian
[SPEAKER_03]: project, even though we call it Persian,
the expansion of the Achaemenid Empire
[SPEAKER_03]: right up into the Indus region of India
and probably across there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they installed all these satraps like
local governors who were Scythians.
[SPEAKER_03]: And during that same period, looking 500
BC, you have this finds of retting lakes
[SPEAKER_03]: suddenly becoming very active up in the
Ganges source rivers up in Kamal and
[SPEAKER_03]: Garhwal type area.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Garhwal, but it's the same bit of the
Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_03]: You suddenly have this massive increase in
using these lakes to rot cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: to make cordage or textiles using cannabis
fibers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is it connected to the Achaemenid
conquest?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who fucking knows, but it seems highly
plausible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And certainly Indian botanists are
inclined to think that it was Scythians
[SPEAKER_03]: who, or at least very, at very least
Scythians were involved in the rise of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis to become a widely cultivated
crop in the Himalayas, because it
[SPEAKER_03]: certainly correlates in terms of the dates
when you start seeing it appearing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Similarly in Nepal, it's the same kind of
period when you find these indications of
[SPEAKER_03]: people moving seeds around into the
Kaligandaki area, which is one of the main
[SPEAKER_03]: routes you would take to go from Central
Asia through Tibet down into Nepal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You suddenly find these fires with clears
of what looked like people eating seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff around 400 BC.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cool thing is all this is sort of
speculation, but there's going to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: whole bunch of genomics work coming out
next year that should be sufficiently
[SPEAKER_03]: granular to start seeing how these
populations fit together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there independent centers of
domestication?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was cannabis domesticated in the Himalayas
independently or was it introduced,
[SPEAKER_03]: as I suspect?
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, there's definitely a plausible
Central Asian... I mean, the Himalayas in
[SPEAKER_03]: a cannabis perspective is Central Asian,
but it's plausibly kind of quite closely
[SPEAKER_03]: tied to more northern groups, like Iranic
kind of groups like the Scythians.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I definitely want to ask you
about is some of the Greek accessions you
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not familiar with Greek cannabis at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some in the freezer,
but I haven't ran any.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you tell me about some of those?
[SPEAKER_03]: So Greece is another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny because it links into what
we've been talking about with the
[SPEAKER_03]: Scythians in the sense that... What I was
thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they documented the... Herodotus
documented all that Scythian cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: culture way, way back.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in terms of what you have with land
races that you can find in Greece these
[SPEAKER_03]: days or could find, they're a much more
recent phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I suspect, although again, this is one of
these things that you actually need
[SPEAKER_03]: genomics to really establish what their
ultimate origin is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But certainly the historical evidence from
the 19th century is that there was a big
[SPEAKER_03]: introduction of seeds to Greece by these
kind of smuggling networks that operated
[SPEAKER_03]: out of Lebanon and Egypt and places and
Turkey and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, there were seeds that were brought
in to give to farmers who were taught how
[SPEAKER_03]: to grow and dry sieve hash and stuff in
order to supply the market in Egypt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there was a huge, huge demand from
Egypt.
[SPEAKER_03]: The big centers of demand for cannabis
drugs were Northern India and Egypt in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of globally.
[SPEAKER_03]: These were the huge... Because there were
these huge cities like Alexandria and
[SPEAKER_03]: Cairo and there were some massive urban
centers where there was this big demand
[SPEAKER_03]: for hash and things.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a ban imposed on Egypt in Egypt,
which meant that the production shifted to
[SPEAKER_03]: Greece and they would just ship it across
from Greece to drop it on the coast in
[SPEAKER_03]: what's now places like Libya and then just
bring it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: The types of plants were basically the
types of plants that were being cultivated
[SPEAKER_03]: in Lebanon and places in Egypt and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would just bring the seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the evidence suggests that seeds were
brought from places like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: To Egypt and certainly the plants are very
closely related.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're semi-dwarf mostly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They stay under two meters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes some individuals can be less
than a meter even if you give them space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not more than two meters would be normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're definitely the same broad group as
what you'd find in Egypt, Lebanon,
[SPEAKER_03]: Syria, Turkey, Morocco.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing to bear in mind is that the sea
was the main way to move stuff around.
[SPEAKER_03]: These things did move around by land but
as we're thinking about tropical sativas,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Bay of Bengal, was this huge point at
which all these genetics were swirling
[SPEAKER_03]: around.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were importing cannabis from
Sumatra to India in the 17th century.
[SPEAKER_03]: Similarly, people were moving hash around
the Eastern Mediterranean a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Consequently, people who were involved in
making money out of it were sometimes
[SPEAKER_03]: moving the seeds around.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was definitely very, very clear there
was an intentional introduction of
[SPEAKER_03]: Levantine or whatever land races to Greece
by these smuggling networks.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like indicas basically in the
sense that we would think of an indica but
[SPEAKER_03]: they tend to be more narrow leafleted and
effect wise they don't have such a strong
[SPEAKER_03]: sedative tendency.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some aficionados call them compact sativas
because the leaflets tend to be on the
[SPEAKER_03]: narrower side.
[SPEAKER_03]: The effect typically tends to be more
euphoric.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that said, you can get very funky,
indica-y smells out of things like
[SPEAKER_03]: Maliotico and stuff, which is one of the
ones we've got.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other big thing to bear in mind with
Greek land races is that they've had at
[SPEAKER_03]: least probably getting on for a century
now of being used as a bud rather than
[SPEAKER_03]: hash because once the prohibition in the
late 1930s in Greece really got enforced
[SPEAKER_03]: quite heavily, people had an incentive to
use the plants as bud rather than hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you've got that culture of using the
plants as bud, you have a much stronger
[SPEAKER_03]: selective pressure for potency because you
keep the seeds from the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: In general, they're more potent compared
to Afghan land races.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're good for that reason for Western
growers who are wanting to grow Sensemila
[SPEAKER_03]: and then plus they have another advantage
which is they're very early finishing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They finish much earlier than Afghan
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real Afghan, real Hindu Kush plants are
not as early as people tend to assume.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason we have all these early Afghans
is because people have selected them for
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, if you grow a field of real
Afghan land races in a field of real Greek
[SPEAKER_03]: or Syrian or Lebanese, whatever,
land races side by side in 40 degrees
[SPEAKER_03]: north, whatever, the Greek stuff will be
finished by late August, early September,
[SPEAKER_03]: whereas the Afghans can be going right
into late October.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're good for that as well,
the Greek plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some indication that they may have
more complicated heritage than I've
[SPEAKER_03]: implied.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them could have been coming
through the Balkans from Turkey and places
[SPEAKER_03]: to Greece.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quite possible that there's a much
earlier lineage than the hash era.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I talked about bringing seeds,
we thought that was 1860s, 1880s era,
[SPEAKER_03]: whereas there's been Turkish
[SPEAKER_03]: influence, cannabis-wise, in Eastern
Europe going way back to the 15th century
[SPEAKER_03]: at least.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a big association between radical
Sufi, Dervish-type culture and cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: that goes way back to the Ottoman era and
the Turkish conquest of Istanbul,
[SPEAKER_03]: Constantinople, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bektashi's and the military units of the
Ottoman Empire were very, very strongly
[SPEAKER_03]: associated with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were a feature in places like Albania
going way back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure there would have been
cannabis growing back in Eastern Europe,
[SPEAKER_03]: like Balkans bits of Eastern Europe way
back, but we just don't know much about
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it's one of those things that the
genomics can piece together.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at Kalamata Red, it's one of
these Greek strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about how pristine that is
necessarily, but on the phylos galaxy,
[SPEAKER_03]: they didn't have anything else on their
database that is very closely connected to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't mean much necessarily because
it's not a comprehensive cycle of the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis genome, but it's another curious
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I suspect it's a more modern creation,
but we've got Moliotiko, we've got one
[SPEAKER_03]: from Crete, we've got one from the
Arcadian, which is really from the real
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of... Moliotiko is really from the
real kind of historic hash producing areas
[SPEAKER_03]: of the 19th century.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I recommend people check them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're much more suited to what most
people are growing for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they sound fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we've talked a lot about the
land race and heirloom type varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you also have stuff like some of the
Dutch stuff, like the 90s Master Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that a Positronix one or a different
one?
[SPEAKER_03]: I made this decision way back to put that
extra A in there, because it's just how
[SPEAKER_03]: it's spelled in Dutch, and that's how it
was written on the packet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was designed to emphasize that the
Afghan 90 was just designed to emphasize
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's like a Dutch Afghan,
rather than... But yeah, so it's a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of material that we got in the...
[SPEAKER_03]: On a trip to Amsterdam in late 80s,
early 90s, some of the people who I worked
[SPEAKER_03]: with were over there in that era.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's Positronix.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just don't know... The thing to bear in
mind is in that time in Holland,
[SPEAKER_03]: you could just go and just buy clones of
someone on the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally, the people would stand around
at festivals.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a video of it on the other side
of people just selling skunk cutting
[SPEAKER_03]: clones on the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could just go into the coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the coffee shops back then were
just like a caravan or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone just parked up a trailer and just
opened the coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: People would just stand around who were
working for some of the seed companies or
[SPEAKER_03]: had their own projects going and just
selling these under... I genuinely...
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody can remember what the brand was
that this was sold as, but it was a very
[SPEAKER_03]: low-budget freelance guy selling these
stuff just in his homemade packs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were all what was going around in
1989, 1990.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like Master Kush skunk special.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a skunk haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: All that stuff from that era that you
would see on the menus in the late 80s,
[SPEAKER_03]: early 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Durban skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we've got other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know from having been there from 92,
93, I guess would be my first... I'd have
[SPEAKER_03]: been 15 or something first time I went
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 14, 15, I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was all the things you would see
on the menu back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them have been branded.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tend to call them kushes and stuff now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you'd even see Chitrala, Chitrali.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Chitrali, but...
Chitrala.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, would be one of the ones you'd see.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you remember as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, there's just a certain
staple of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've got a pretty good representation
of all of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a question of how many of them
we can get to germinate now out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: packs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of them we've had to do as
feminized just because we just didn't get
[SPEAKER_03]: males and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still... You've got feminized now,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been working a lot more with
feminized stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just made a category for it because I
was getting tired of people writing to me
[SPEAKER_03]: asking, like, have we got feminized seeds
or do we do feminized seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just made a specific category for
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of it is just because some of
them, like the freak show and things made
[SPEAKER_03]: just because people want them feminized.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Dutch stuff, though, we've had to
feminize them sometimes because we just
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't get any males.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a handful of these to pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like what... I think in the
future we'll make some regular ones based
[SPEAKER_03]: on whatever we can find that's as close as
we can get to the... So for the Durban,
[SPEAKER_03]: we did cross it with the Nirvana Durban
Skunk because it just seemed out of all of
[SPEAKER_03]: the ones available, it was actually truest
to the original
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff that was in Holland back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's going to be interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'm going to try and get genomics,
proper hardcore genomics work done on all
[SPEAKER_03]: of those as well, because it could be
quite a useful reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the original Dutch stuff we've got from
the 90s, because it could be quite handy
[SPEAKER_00]: for mapping everything out if they are
It's super important for any genomics
[SPEAKER_00]: database to have that stuff, because it is
the backbone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and again, it would be good to
actually really get that spelled out as
[SPEAKER_03]: clearly as possible for some of the
younger folks involved, because I just
[SPEAKER_03]: think so many people come into growing
with this sense that all these names
[SPEAKER_03]: correspond to some botanical reality when
actually it's probably about 10 names that
[SPEAKER_03]: actually have any meaningful basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially as the Spanish got involved too
with the white labeling and that changed
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the Spanish stuff is good because
it is just good to have as much diversity
[SPEAKER_03]: of different people doing stuff,
but I get a little frustrated with the
[SPEAKER_03]: fact that so much of the ostensible land
race stuff that's going around in Spain is
[SPEAKER_03]: just stuff that's been hit with Northern
Lights or Skunk or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get that some people justify that in
terms of meeting their customers halfway.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, come on, my customers aren't
nerds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just tell them it's land race.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like, yeah, kind of.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also, there's an ecological issue
going on here, which is actually cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: is no exception in terms of the massive
loss of biodiversity that's probably going
[SPEAKER_03]: on and certainly is going on in terms of
what's cultivated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you've got to actually take a bit
of responsibility with educating your
[SPEAKER_03]: customer base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't expect them to spend hours
digging through the literature and just
[SPEAKER_03]: tell them straight up, this is actually
something we've out-crossed at Northern
[SPEAKER_03]: Lights and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That distinction is important,
especially if it dominates it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually had discussions with some of
the Spanish guys and they've been like,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, but we've taken it through five
generations since and it's all leans
[SPEAKER_03]: really heavily towards the original land
race.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, yeah, okay, yeah, that's
great, but still just put it in the
[SPEAKER_03]: description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How hard is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: They used to, but then there was a point
where suddenly the land race became this
[SPEAKER_03]: really big thing and they just fucking cut
it all out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, guys, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you wanted to highlight
specifically that you've been working on
[SPEAKER_00]: lately or any of the stuff that you've put
up recently or anything at all that you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to highlight?
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the really exciting things is that
there will be some papers coming out,
[SPEAKER_03]: studies coming out over the next half a
year to a year of really seriously high
[SPEAKER_03]: quality genomics work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've sent in all of the material I've got
to these projects and they will be
[SPEAKER_03]: producing what should be the first really
good quality pan genome for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole species essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the basis of that, we'll have some
publicly... It'll all be publicly
[SPEAKER_03]: available data and also some breeding
tools based on that that you can basically
[SPEAKER_03]: send in, you can use to really know,
you can really start establishing genuine
[SPEAKER_03]: pedigrees and this is ideally what will be
achieved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ultimate strain nerd shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so for just people who have just
to... There's an end in itself,
[SPEAKER_03]: the strain nerd stuff, but also actually
for the serious breeding work,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can use these things as well so you
can really know what you've got and really
[SPEAKER_03]: start catching up on the seven,
eight lost decades that cannabis has had
[SPEAKER_03]: in some respects compared to other crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be some really good tools
available to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, even if you're... You can have
the equivalent... This is again,
[SPEAKER_03]: ideally equivalent level of quality of
information about what you've got that
[SPEAKER_03]: Monsanto has, even if you're just a small
business, you can access.
[SPEAKER_03]: Access this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's hopefully going to level the
playing field for people who are involved
[SPEAKER_03]: in cannabis breeding, which would be nice
given how money has made the playing field
[SPEAKER_03]: very not fucking level already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely say that your company
caters to breeders, which I wish more
[SPEAKER_00]: companies would.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that should be coveted.
[SPEAKER_00]: To have actual breeders wanting your stuff
should... I think that lends a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: credibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, ideally that would be what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many barriers still which are
in the way in terms of to have the... Even
[SPEAKER_03]: for projects which have got big money
involved, it's classic kind of story is
[SPEAKER_03]: that a lot of drugs germplasm,
I'm talking other crops now as well,
[SPEAKER_03]: has just vanished over the years because
there's just sheer economics of actually
[SPEAKER_03]: utilizing this material.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really fucking challenging.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like if you've got however many acres
of land available to you to be growing on,
[SPEAKER_03]: how much of that are you going to set
aside to actually work a land race?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not just out cross and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are shortcuts now you can take like
this kind of pre-breeding where you try
[SPEAKER_03]: and move the useful alleles from one land
race into an established cultivar or from
[SPEAKER_03]: a feral population into an established
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: You try and basically take some handy
traits like drought resistance or disease
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance, like powdery mildew resistance
or whatever smell or whatever aroma you're
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can shortcut from the land race to the
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's very seldom you get anyone
actually just inbreeding with one line to
[SPEAKER_03]: create an heirloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we've got so few actual genuine
heirlooms now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as far as I know, X18 and
Deepchunk, as far as we know, are
[SPEAKER_03]: genuinely inbred from one land race.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to take genomics to actually
establish that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the general consensus is I've never
had anyone contesting that idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there aren't many genuine pure sativas
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even Hayes is a hybrid of sativas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then most of the ostensible Jamaican
or African things going around.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Spain, they've all been hit with
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think many people argue with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were asking about the Yunnan line.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's a skunk crossed to
something from kind of border lands of
[SPEAKER_03]: Yunnan.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a land race.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the best of my knowledge, there's no
historic kind of culture of growing
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis as a drug in that bit of southern
China.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you move across the border into the
kind of Thai areas, sure, you get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a kind of ganja culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Yunnan itself has no culture with
these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of what's passed around is anyway
just hybridized stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that most of the notionally
Burmese lines in North America are
[SPEAKER_03]: hybridized things.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Burmese line doesn't look anything
like the plants we've got direct from
[SPEAKER_03]: Burma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot of the Canadian
Burmese lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burmese stuff that I've seen that looks
just mostly Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and you just don't get plants in
places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plants like that just do not naturally
occur in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not in a monsoon area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just any tropical area.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many reasons why it's not
advantageous to have broad leaflets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and pathogens and broad leaflets are so
much easier for insects to work on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's all kinds of reasons why you
don't get that in the tropical population.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, that's the most interesting
thing, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully next year is going to be really
quite an exciting year in terms of the
[SPEAKER_03]: science of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And making life much more easy for people
who are doing reading projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to see what you do with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, it's not me doing the actual
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just submitted a whole bunch of...
Well, okay, I've done the work in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: collecting these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just donated a bunch of material to
some projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And see what they actually do in terms of
making sense of it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as I understand, they've got
really, really super high quality long
[SPEAKER_03]: sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the most important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phyllis didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did the short.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this is mega long, ultra high quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the problem with the genomics work
to date, aside from some sort of ethical
[SPEAKER_03]: issues and stuff, is that the reference
genomes that people have been using are
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're all kinds of different read
depths and all kinds of incongruities
[SPEAKER_03]: between the data sets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know two groups, one mathematician and
then another more kind of cannabis centric
[SPEAKER_03]: group who've done work on the existing
data and just got these completely back to
[SPEAKER_03]: front fucking results.
[SPEAKER_03]: This math guy is like, I'm just going
through all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, all the data is saying that
the modern hybrids are more diverse than
[SPEAKER_03]: the land races.
[SPEAKER_03]: The media reaction is like, well,
that's fucking what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, no, it's just this fucking
data is a fucking mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're looking at comparable kind
of crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a general point of comparison,
like if you look at other kind of land
[SPEAKER_03]: race comparisons to material, you're
looking at least like five times more
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity in the land races.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would expect with cannabis,
once you factor in like really weedy
[SPEAKER_03]: populations, it's way more fucking
diversity in them compared to the modern
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, so much dodgy work or just
limited quality work that's been done to
[SPEAKER_03]: date.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully next year would be quite a
big leap forward in terms of making sense
[SPEAKER_03]: of all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I truly hope so.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of us that could use that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's so much to be clarified.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just chatting with these people as they're
going through all the research.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of the first things of mine
that they looked at was like that Sudanese
[SPEAKER_03]: accession.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they basically were just like,
we're going to like basically have to
[SPEAKER_03]: rewrite our entire genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like, yeah, it's like the
first one they looked at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, yeah, case is like,
whoa, we just got like completely off the
[SPEAKER_03]: charts here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they looked at just even just the
Milana and Parbati accessions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not even really like a pure
land race.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, yeah, we're finding
whole new like sex markers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is for sex expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't even found before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like crazy examples of like mono
EC in the Southeast Asians and in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghan and in one of the Greek ones,
they was finding this like XY mono EC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like normally you find it on the anyway,
like males that were like genetically male
[SPEAKER_03]: showing mono EC and stuff, which is like,
again, super interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of future breeding possibilities
and stuff, because mono EC stuff is a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: easier for many reasons to breed with and
work with and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, it's all kinds of possibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like so much catching up to be
done with such an important crop that's
[SPEAKER_03]: just been held back massively.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it should be really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that sounds fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a few questions I want to go
through just from our Discord that people
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to go for the best ones because
there's quite a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so most of these questions we've
actually covered as a course of just
[SPEAKER_00]: conversing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one, I mean like almost all of
them we covered just by conversing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one that I think will be probably the
most asked question you'd probably when
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a lot is from a CCC and he asked
how to keep relatively pure sative as
[SPEAKER_00]: manageable indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any advice on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, one of the main tricks people do
that I'm aware of is you can use pot size
[SPEAKER_03]: to just control and because if it's really
like a pure straight from a farmer type
[SPEAKER_03]: sativa, they're going to keep rooting even
during flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can just pot up in the kind of
second week of flower or so still and you
[SPEAKER_03]: should find that it will still root into
the new compost, which can be good as well
[SPEAKER_03]: because it can mean that you don't make
the mistake of like overfeeding too much
[SPEAKER_03]: during flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing with sativas indoors
is to try to not overwater them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's a really important aspect of
traditional farming of ganja, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: cinnamon, whatever, is the right
irrigation schedule.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even these days, the good quality
production in places like Laos and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: is in areas where they've got access to
lakes or ponds or streams to irrigate on
[SPEAKER_03]: schedule rather than just allowing rain
fed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so in other words, the main good
quality crop is done from sort of sowing
[SPEAKER_03]: in mid-August-ish and then harvesting kind
of February-ish.
[SPEAKER_03]: So September-ish or whatever to February,
March-ish, basically six months over the
[SPEAKER_03]: starting at the end of monsoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can have a bit of rain whilst the
plants are in the veg, but really once
[SPEAKER_03]: you're into flower, you're looking to like
have zero rain ideally and just have
[SPEAKER_03]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the mistake people make indoors is to
overwater.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've already kind of touched on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other thing is you can,
if they're a real land race, you can prune
[SPEAKER_03]: back pretty fucking heavily if you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can concentrate the bud production
into exactly where you want if you prune
[SPEAKER_03]: carefully.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can prune like quite late on in
the cycle of growth still.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can't think of other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest with you, I'm not like an
expert grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just know from talking to people and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have like a huge amount of
opportunities to grow because of the
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of moving around I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, they're not well adapted to
indoors basically as the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really want to be outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: The type of land they want to be on is a
really important consideration.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the big ganja growing areas of India
in the late 19th, 30th, 20th century,
[SPEAKER_03]: there was quite a good documentation done
of that whole economy because it was
[SPEAKER_03]: economically very significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the land along the rivers along the
Ganges Delta area that was very loamy,
[SPEAKER_03]: like light, sandy loams that don't hold
water too much, but are very nutrient
[SPEAKER_03]: rich.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were really sought after by people who
wanted to get into commercial production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were techniques which are still
used of how you prepare the land.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they'll do this still in Southeast
Asia.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you create ridges, like raised beds,
like a kind of semi-circle type shade.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means that the water runs off the
roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the thing you're just trying to avoid
is to have the roots sitting in
[SPEAKER_03]: waterlogged land because that cannabis
just does not fucking like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will get infected and there are all
kinds of problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Parasites and pathogens that were already
very well known back in that time,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are even kind of a specific forms of
powdery mildew and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these conversations sometimes with
people who are like using these,
[SPEAKER_03]: what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Natural sort of, what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some kind of like people basically growing
in this like composting compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even properly composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Korean natural farming stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I get these kind of emails from
people sometimes and I try and be as nice
[SPEAKER_03]: as I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: On principle, I'm all for kind of
permaculture and anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Jesus man, like cannabis does not want
to be in that kind of fucking situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy writes to me like, yeah,
I've created this amazing system where
[SPEAKER_03]: like the soil is wet 24-7.
[SPEAKER_03]: No cannabis wants to be like, okay,
with hydroponics and stuff, maybe they've,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think over the last 50,
60 years, like cannabis in the West has
[SPEAKER_03]: adapted to all kinds of maltreatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But ultimately, yeah, you don't want to be
growing a land race in like soggy,
[SPEAKER_03]: incredibly rich compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially not with like stuff literally
rotting on the surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you send me like a photo?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he says this thing is like fucking
cooch grass, like growing in the same pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each their own, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, God bless them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any strange you want to highlight
that you currently have for sale right
[SPEAKER_00]: now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or anything else you want to talk about
and get in?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm really interested like,
and you can, I collected a bunch of stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: from a risk there, which is sort of just
south of Bengal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, which I suspect is quite
historically significant in terms of the
[SPEAKER_03]: development of, of sativas, like real
tropical sinsemila land races.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've been talking about there's
that book, the kind of alchemical,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's an alchemical book, actually,
the Anandakanda is the name of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: where they describe the sinsemila
technique that's from around there,
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of Andhra Pradesh, Barissa area was
where that was probably compiled.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I suspect those plants are pretty
interesting to look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: They seem to be like probably more like
five months from seed to harvest the ones
[SPEAKER_03]: we've got.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, yeah, and then planning to have
some Nepali ganja land races available
[SPEAKER_03]: soon as well, which I think will be pretty
interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just in terms of product stuff,
like I'm a big fan of the Southeast
[SPEAKER_03]: Asians, but the because of the aromas and
stuff, and I think there's been a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: hybridity between possibly like
independent centers of domestication south
[SPEAKER_03]: of Yunnan with the East Indian center of
domestication.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, this is just a hunch,
but anyway, I think these actual South
[SPEAKER_03]: Asian land races like from Arissa and
Andhra Pradesh and the Tarai regions of
[SPEAKER_03]: Nepal are worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got already some like Dakshin
Kali is the name of the one from Nepal,
[SPEAKER_03]: we've got this kind of, you could say
like, being domesticated, it definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: has been domesticated for uses,
but not just as hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the Arissa one is very much
specifically for bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: And both of them, I think will be really
interesting to look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice aromas from them too,
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And types of effect are really good,
like very stimulating and positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm quite keen to see what the
genomics work discovers about them,
[SPEAKER_03]: because my hunch is that probably the East
Indian Nepal and East India are kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: where the city was really originated
first.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to see that all work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where should people go to buy your seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the website?
[SPEAKER_03]: The realseedcompany.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for the modern stuff is
quickseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a stupid name, but it's like what I
originally planned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd originally planned it as like a
budget thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to buy a bunch of cheapo
Dutch seeds and sell it on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't want to get into big business
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of just at speed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, for the time being anyway,
all the really interesting 90s material
[SPEAKER_03]: we've got and some other later 90s things
like Cinderella 99, Amnesia, which are
[SPEAKER_03]: really good, very strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: As well, if you're looking for like
strong, really strong stuff and then some
[SPEAKER_03]: Colombian import that's probably like a
Northern Lights crossed with the Colombian
[SPEAKER_03]: Landerace, then crossed with some like
airline Colombian and Mexican things,
[SPEAKER_03]: all kinds of things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a whole bunch of just like kind of fun
hybrids with things like Pakistan,
[SPEAKER_03]: Tritral Cush crossed with like some
Landeraces, which would be great like for
[SPEAKER_03]: just making hash and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And very nice prices for most of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just fun stuff to play with if you've got
the space and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any way you'd prefer to be contacted to if
people want to reach out to you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally, if you want a quick response
like the Gmail, realseedco.gmail is best.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can contact me on Instagram as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But sometimes I'm not on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may not get back to you as quickly and I
sometimes miss the incoming messages.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget to check the request a bit
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to use the site contact form or just
email me directly and I should get back to
[SPEAKER_03]: you within like two or three days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I got to say, I'd love to have you
back sometime when time allows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an absolute pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very kind of you to give me the
space to just ramble.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm slightly fucking burned out and a
bit like sleep deprived.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it seems to be when I do these
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe when I'm back in the UK,
we can do another one that are more
[SPEAKER_03]: civilized.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's kind of a civilized hour now,
but I'm just not a civilized person.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've not been getting out of bed
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, it's been it's been good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your time, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to air Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, people are going to be stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are really going to dig it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably cut it into two or three
parts.
