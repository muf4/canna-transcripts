[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_00]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-so-Dot, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everyone and welcome to Breeders'
Syndicate Reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we will be looking at a strain from
Santa Cruz Goat Farm and it is his Afghani
[SPEAKER_00]: train wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first strain we're going to check out
is Afghan Rails from Santa Cruz Goat Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I first look at the buds,
it's very, very dense, especially for a
[SPEAKER_00]: train wreck hybrid, but it's not as dense
as, say, a Cookies or a Kush or an OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at it, it's very, very resinous,
lots of trichomes, amazing resin
[SPEAKER_00]: production, as you usually find in train
wreck hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Train wrecks are a very nice resin
producer, though it does have short resin
[SPEAKER_00]: glands and stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the first smell I smell when breaking
it up, there is a soapiness that is like
[SPEAKER_00]: OG, but it's not OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I wouldn't smell this and
immediately go, oh, that's got OG in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an old Afghani-type smell that I
usually associate with old Afghans.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some skunkiness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, typical of old Afghans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this Afghan is supposed to be
from 1988, an old Santa Cruz special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, it's got the earthy
tones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's even got some chocolate, lots of
funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got clean tones, almost like laundry,
along with the soapiness, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really unique terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at first glance, you know,
it looks like an old Afghan type,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the complexity of the terpene profile
really, really stands out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty impressed so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give this a smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when doing reviews, I always like to
make sure whatever piece I'm smoking out
[SPEAKER_00]: of is completely clean, just as if the day
it was bought, you know, totally clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: no resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be able to taste everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to taste all the complexities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be able to smell the
complexities as I bring the pipe up to my
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to it, but the main
important thing is keep your water clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep your piece clean if you're going to
be doing reviews and really trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what's going on with the high
and how a strain interacts with your body
[SPEAKER_00]: best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can taste the soapiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was almost a tobacco note that came
with it, which is really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never really tasted that in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little bit of terpene from the train
wreck really does give you a mouthful of
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very special, very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high, very quick, very quick acting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can already feel it sitting in the back
of my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like most Afghans do, it does have a
very narcotic body high type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It immediately sits right behind my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now remember, everybody is going to
feel a different reaction due to their
[SPEAKER_00]: brain chemistry and how certain
cannabinoids affect a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's brain chemistry is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you go into a dispensary and
someone tells you that a plant will always
[SPEAKER_00]: affect you a certain way, indicas always
do this, sativas always do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: please don't take it at face value.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no one who can tell you exactly
how any strain will affect you at any
[SPEAKER_00]: certain time of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, certain strains I can smoke in the
morning, the first smoke of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it will affect me much different than
it would right before bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to keep in mind too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I give this a five out of five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love old Afghanis, I love train wreck,
and I'll be growing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be in my garden very soon and
I'll be doing a selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Pac from Santa Cruz Goat
Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killer bug, killer grow, killer breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking forward to doing other
reviews on the other herbs dropped,
[SPEAKER_00]: including the Santa Cruz Blue Dream Crosta
train wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep your ears peeled for that one.
