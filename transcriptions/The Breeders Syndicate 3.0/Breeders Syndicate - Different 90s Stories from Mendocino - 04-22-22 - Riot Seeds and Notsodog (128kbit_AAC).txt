[SPEAKER_00]: Howdy!
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_03]: How's everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm barely awake.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize in advance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been on a backwards fucking schedule,
so... Gotta move again soon, so... Fun
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody loves moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I feel about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we're just waiting for Natso to
show up so we can...
[SPEAKER_03]: get this party started.
[SPEAKER_03]: I came a little early.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what she said.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Bullseye?
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: How's everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Before Natso gets here, don't forget to
join the Patreon, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some cool shit going on tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some fights that I'll be watching.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have the Hawaiian Lights drop for
the Patreon folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the hybrids are out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been out for about a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be adding those to the non-Patreon
very soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got those going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of good shit popping off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Farm stuff, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you checked out those Fem lines,
those are up right now for everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Natso should be joining us any time
soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Except that I accepted it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess we will see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until then, I'll just keep staring at my
own fucking head.
[SPEAKER_03]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, you silly bastard?
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got allergies and my internet connection
sucks today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize ahead of time for any
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still getting over the sickness that
I've been having, mostly just in my chest
[SPEAKER_03]: and in my sinuses still.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking bad, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever I got was bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'm getting sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's Mendo and springtime and
things are blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's out and about, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about that time, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what's funny is like a million
years ago when I first came to California
[SPEAKER_00]: to see The Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia
Band, I came out here in spring,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything was green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And coming from Illinois, where I'm from,
where it's flat as a pancake because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the glacier, I thought it was like
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all like rolling hills and flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was brutally cold where I lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was so nice here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had no idea it got to like 110 and
everything died in summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it gets to be like 120.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, you live in the literal frying
pan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we live in hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you live in hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not my favorite part of
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not it's not my spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We burst Kevin McCarthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you like flat and dry and
very, very hot, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warm nights and good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is our topic for tonight as far as
education goes?
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as education goes, I thought we
would chat about a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would talk about maybe sort of like the
very late 90s, early 2000s period in the
[SPEAKER_00]: West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because there's a whole bunch of stuff
then that's pretty pertinent to now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was all kind of going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think we might talk about at
some point probably will fit in because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been a big topic amongst us this week
is a little bit of like authenticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how to you know, how to address that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you address authenticity?
[SPEAKER_03]: And these times where everybody's making
money off something being authentic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people, you know, people have their
own their own motivations, their own
[SPEAKER_00]: wants, needs and desires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, because some cherry pie
kush talk cherry pie might be able to fit
[SPEAKER_00]: into that a little late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kind of avoided the whole cookie
thing yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a couple of episodes on its
own and it's pretty complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we probably will chat about that at
some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it needs that one needs some fleshing
out a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a deep one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a deep one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of people making a lot
of money off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of rep on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more money and rep you have,
it kind of ties into the authenticity
[SPEAKER_00]: thing we were just talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start talking history and it
interferes with anybody's money or rep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, they're extremely
upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I made this I made this
like joking post.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't post much anymore on IG,
but I made this joking post.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw this cartoon and it was like,
I remember it differently in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: fits my worldview and paints me in a
positive light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, relating to weed history,
like you run into that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you you run into that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so maybe we should I don't know,
what do we we're getting up to 150 ish
[SPEAKER_00]: people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to bullshit for a couple of
minutes and allow people to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get to a certain point before we start
chatting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's here's one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just what is the best blueberry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another one that when I tell
you what I think, people will get upset at
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, if you talk to second
generation genetics, who is JD,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's DJ son or DJ, they will say the only
legitimate place to get blueberry is them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the you know, for some reason,
the blue bonnet seems to throw these days,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least some really potent blueberry
turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get to take credit for it,
but I did use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just to be transparent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had I mean, there's actually a tie
into Well, I had my own blueberry line
[SPEAKER_03]: that I created before during the time the
blue bonnet was being made.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Lone Star was kind of competition to
me at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was very egotistical about my
blueberry, of course, because everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: thinks they have the best blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I used it and it did breed true for
blue traits and very beautiful blue turps
[SPEAKER_03]: and very pretty, but it didn't have much
potency or resin production to speak of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Lone Star did it better than I
did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're lucky is that it still
exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can still get it from a number of
different sources.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're up to a decent time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these talks have kind of been we've
we've been kind of moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started in the beginning in the 90s a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're starting to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually still have like a third wave
of seed banks that Matt and I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we never actually dealt with that
involves Canada and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it starts to get a little bit more
dispersed and difficult to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's taken us kind of a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot to cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to leave out a lot of stuff
and you don't want to forget a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some stuff we do leave out and forget
and have to go back and tag because it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of you know, that's kind
of one of the things about these talks is
[SPEAKER_00]: there a bunch of history.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some there's some speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some bullshitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to be conversational and
tell people about the memories that people
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we'll talk about things,
but they get people bent under shape
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than talking about like the
third wave of seed banks, I thought we
[SPEAKER_00]: could chat more about like what was
happening on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is where Matt and I both live.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was happening on the West Coast in
that era and how specifically California
[SPEAKER_00]: and how that kind of like started to
impact what came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to let everybody know,
in 1996, in November, they passed the 215
[SPEAKER_00]: Act, the Proposition 215 in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that made it was the first state where
you had medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, medical was very
restrictive at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was only about four or five
conditions that it applied to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cops had spent their whole career
just busting anyone with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were also slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were slow to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because they saw weed and they were
like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm arresting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people think that it like just
became legal in 1997.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started a slow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the era we're going to talk about is
sort of like the very beginning of when
[SPEAKER_00]: guerrillas started to end and that process
started to really take place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was the very beginning of
medical in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things were starting to open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were starting to be less secretive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we mentioned on shows before,
I think it was 1999 that overgrowth
[SPEAKER_00]: started and not that long after the
cannabis world started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the years on when they
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, after a few years,
you had this network of people that were
[SPEAKER_00]: connecting via these via these,
you know, these forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chatting and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one that ended up happening is,
you know, this this started a whole wave
[SPEAKER_00]: of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, you know, really the forums
were the first time you could really ever
[SPEAKER_00]: trade outside your circle that you knew in
person.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even even today, I still see
people, you know, in other states where
[SPEAKER_03]: they say, you know, I can't get that
clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in this state and it kind of blows
my mind because back then even like we
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't all live in like people were
getting bubba clones from Ohio,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that were in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you didn't necessarily go to the
state to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you know, one of the things
that's interesting about that is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's there's different people
for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a good buddy of ours that lives
back in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, for him, the forums and IG
and Discord and stuff like that was a way
[SPEAKER_00]: for him to talk to other weed nerds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for somebody like me who lives in
Mendo, like everyone around me does what I
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no shortage of hanging out like
I'm surrounded by people like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was some people that like were,
you know, really intent upon getting on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was their mode of communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of us just lived in places and
stayed off all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so like when you popped up or
whatever, it doesn't really like correlate
[SPEAKER_00]: to like what you're up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all lived in the shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tying into that, I'm I'm probably in my
I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably in my mid 20s or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I meet this guy and I don't think it's
weird to say his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name was Ron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Matt knows Ron very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ron was Ron's a character and he's
still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did this thing where he started
throwing these harvest parties in fall in
[SPEAKER_00]: in my area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually threw him he'd rent like a
big ass fucking house in Sonoma County,
[SPEAKER_00]: Healdsburg outskirts, areas like that,
like a big mansion, essentially.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had like a catering company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this thing would be you pay a
certain amount of money and this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: would be catered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all these heads would come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was the first time for me that I
really was around like that kind of scene,
[SPEAKER_00]: because most of those people that were
there, like they knew each other from
[SPEAKER_00]: Overgrower Cannabis World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like groups that came with
people like me and stuff like that that
[SPEAKER_00]: like were from that area as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a lot of people from all
over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people running who Ron is,
he's NCGA, North Cal Growers Association.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people associate him with like
the Blue Widow cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of his big jams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he used to help people get set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always been pretty politically
active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always been a lot of the fairs and a
lot of various things that went on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he'd usually have a booth and he
politically organized early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got me my first Emerald Cup cannabis
booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the first booth I ever shared an
Emerald Cup was with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was with Ron.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I went to this thing,
I don't know, I was 23, 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went with my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got invited by a buddy of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was neat about it is you go to
this place and you walk in, they have
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, huge dining room table or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone that wanted to share,
you would write your name, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: usually like the handle from the forums or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would write your name and you would
put some weed in the bag or the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the whole table is full of
different kinds of weed and hash samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's, you know, and then it's one
of those things where you hang out for two
[SPEAKER_00]: or three days and smoke a ton of weed and
trade seeds with people and trade strains
[SPEAKER_00]: with people and shoot the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go there and I'm young and I'm hoping
to meet like, I am like so convinced,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, that I'm going to meet these old
timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning my age now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's at the time, you know,
I, oh, dirty old sog was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so I'm all convinced I'm going to
meet all these people and they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to, they're, I'm like, it's going to like
unlock the key to a bunch of old school
[SPEAKER_00]: strains I want.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get there enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't some of that there,
but there was, there was so much like
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that was super popular in the
very early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like Apollo 11, Apollo 13,
C99.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, white widow hybrids,
fricking SSH hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's telling us the best times I ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were super cool parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was really cool to,
to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a bunch of people there
who I won't mention because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be popular, but I will tell you,
that's the first place that I ever met CSI
[SPEAKER_00]: in person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first place that I met a Shaw
who some people probably know as 707 seed
[SPEAKER_00]: bank on a G who did the, you know,
the chem, the chem dog BX two and a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of work with cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people got Bubba Kush from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's a, he was a pretty big guy
back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was pretty involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaw, you know, people like Jason King
from the can of Bible, Kyle Cushman,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Herrera, you know, just, you know,
a bunch of mountain men from Mendo and
[SPEAKER_00]: humble, you know, and then various types
of people like chip who now has a,
[SPEAKER_00]: the real dirt podcast, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was actually when he, at those
parties, that was before he started Royal
[SPEAKER_00]: gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was still working on like Coco fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that was so long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coco fiber wasn't even a commercial
product available in stores yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was planning on bringing it to,
to America.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hadn't started Royal gold, but he was
planning on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wild.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so a lot of us, that was,
that was a lot of times where the,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we got to put faces to names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I didn't even know a dirty,
I would have loved to have hung out and
[SPEAKER_00]: talked to dirty old saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know, you know, if I met,
if I know your real name, I don't know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hit me up, but there was a,
but there was a bunch of people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like chip, for instance,
who started Royal gold, he, he had just
[SPEAKER_00]: come back one of those years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had just come back from Switzerland,
a tour in Switzerland.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for people that don't know
Switzerland was like the first place in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe to really open up to cannabis,
like outdoor and greenhouse style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when Amsterdam and Holland got
rough, Shanti and Breeder Steve and a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of different people shifted over to
Swiss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Chip had gone out and visited those
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's got all these pictures on his
computer of like these greenhouses full of
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's Hayes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 10 foot tall plants, direct planted
in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just, yeah, Vic high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just really neat because it was a
lot of, it was a lot of connected people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of people that were active on
the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was five or six or seven years before
the reversal era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything was, everything was red
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't any, any S one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even think I'd heard the term S
one outside of a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything, everything, everything was
hybrids, you know, and people would bring
[SPEAKER_00]: their hash, bring their seeds,
bring their own personal breedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like a way, instead of mailing
each other and giving out addresses and
[SPEAKER_00]: DMS and all that, it was like a super swap
meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was really neat in that regard
because for once one thing, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ron had a catering business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of the money that everybody
pitched in, he hired his whole team and
[SPEAKER_00]: you, and he made two meals a day for three
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to sit there and roll joints and
smoke and shoot the shit and pull tubes
[SPEAKER_00]: and trade seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're fucking starving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like some like tuna on crisps
comes by the thing, you know, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I want some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just so high and you just start
eating some of that and drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you feel a million times better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so the reason I bring that up is
because while now with a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: events and a lot of these lives and a lot
of, a lot of times, like, uh, putting a
[SPEAKER_00]: face to a name has become common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then it was uncommon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, really, it was really,
it was really like unusual and neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You felt special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I mean, there was,
uh, you know, there was times where,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I went, I went there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, the foods were to die for
olds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were fully catered full on meals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd have snacks and hors d'oeuvres that
would be get brought around finger food
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty decadent.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then just like anything
else, even if you're an experienced
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker, you start smoking eight,
10, 15 kinds of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't normally smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the first time you're smoking all
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even a week or moderate weed will get you
pretty baked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually, if you just pull in all day,
nonstop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, there was different
things where it was like, you can't hang
[SPEAKER_00]: out with everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you make friends,
some friends I made there, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I kept up with really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others like CSI, I didn't catch up with
again for a number of years after those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you just, you're in different
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, you know, all that different types
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, uh, it was kind of just
like a who's who.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of, a lot of the times those
people, Fletch, people that weren't very
[SPEAKER_00]: well known then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now they're all hella well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and they have some of the best
seed banks, you know, some of the best
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders around, some of the best
collections of weed around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, when I went there,
I didn't have most of the stuff that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have now, but I had, I had the Maui and I
had the, the Chem 91 and the Super Skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: and I had the Super Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my, uh, my buddy who doesn't like to
be mentioned, uh, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: from Staten Island, he came a couple of
years with us, you know, um, cause we were
[SPEAKER_00]: still like right in the middle of doing
that Super Dog project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we had different phenos,
we had the Super Skunk, we had different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had hash that we had sifted from things
and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just a really neat gathering in
time period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: People keep asking like, what happened?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think, I think we did a good job of
recreating a little bit of that just a few
[SPEAKER_03]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, a lot of people weren't invited,
you know, because it was smaller,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think, I think that there's still an
ability for our community to pull together
[SPEAKER_03]: like that and have these big events where
people just get a long chill and smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so it was a privilege because I wasn't
around for, for the Ron parties at all,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it was a privilege to be a part of
the, the Cannelluminati parties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are, it was fucking insane to be fly
on the wall at those events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they keep, they do keep happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I will say that like, they
probably won't happen like that quite
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just for the simple fact that shit
changes, you know, uh, nobody knew who CSI
[SPEAKER_00]: was then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knew who Fletcher was then nobody
knew who I was that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was people that were known,
you know, but a lot of them were,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were all in our twenties or whatever,
just trying to figure out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: various aspects of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we were all learning and
trading from each other and seeing what
[SPEAKER_00]: was up and it was, uh, you know,
it was just days of, and there also wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of money or rep involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like the last era before
that era started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were all young, innocent and dumb
and, you know, and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less of a competitive nature, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all, I mean, honestly,
I came home with so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that event and I gave away,
you know, thousands of seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just traded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you've got some sweet tooth by
Blockhead from Steve, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, give me a hundred of those and I'll
give you a hundred of this into this into
[SPEAKER_00]: this into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it was like, try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hadn't been monetized yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one really believed that you could make
a bunch of money in America selling seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just didn't exist yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like all these heads each with
their, everybody was happy to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to like they, if you could get people you
respected to grow your beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like, you know, and then they hit
me up and they were like, dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: I found fire in your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're like walking around and you
feel all good about yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, uh, you know, and,
uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the forum era, uh, Caleb was white
trash, red neck or inspector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's CSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's turpogs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to, we're going to bounce
around because all those different things
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to kind of like put a,
um, you know, Ron's parties were where a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of us made friendships with each
other, um, where a lot of us met for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time, it brought together different,
disparate groups of, uh, weed heads from
[SPEAKER_00]: their twenties through their forties,
you know, fifties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it went on for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it, you know, it happened in the,
in the, in the falls, there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: fire outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should also mention, because this is
pretty important to that era where this is
[SPEAKER_00]: before the Urkel and the, and the purple
craze really took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, that's really important
because all good weed still got grown and
[SPEAKER_00]: was sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really hadn't been waves where it
was like, get this one cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this cut, you can sell all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That hadn't really happened yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I attribute a lot of that to fucking Jason
King too, for hyping cups up so fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: hard that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, it's, it's, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't necessarily attribute it to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I attribute it to the brokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I can't, I can't talk about other
areas, but like in Mendo, let's say oh
[SPEAKER_00]: four, oh five.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanted to have a 50 lighter and you
wanted to sell every gram of your weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had granddaddy purple or Urkel or
something along those or Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had sweet tooth by Louie,
maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you probably could.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying you couldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there wasn't buyers shooting up from
the Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like give me, I got, I got room for X
amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me that sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, but you know,
cause all that, all that work,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say that like, so, and we'll talk
about that at some of these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what were the, all the popular things
you can think of were at that party,
[SPEAKER_00]: both his flower and hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the white family was crossed into
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ shorts, the blueberry family was
crossed into tons of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brothers grim was crossed into a different
amount of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then, you know, a bunch of
classics and things like that that were
[SPEAKER_00]: still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was still doing big stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federation was still doing big at that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, people, I can answer that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone just said, where's Jason King?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's on Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we'll, we'll talk about that in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because that was actually,
well that, that'll overlap, but it really
[SPEAKER_00]: was, it really was like, you know,
you hear about the legendary harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: festivals that happened in Humboldt or
Mendo, small little gatherings and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's really what it felt like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like being able to go to one of
those types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then you really just talk shop
and weed with your close group of hermit
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting to, getting to go to like,
and hang out with dozens of different
[SPEAKER_00]: people for three or four days and chat and
chat it up, uh, really set the foundations
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of the, a lot of the friendships
and stuff, uh, for later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really made a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, um, Frank, you know, friendships
were forged, their transfers were made,
[SPEAKER_00]: their bit, you know, ideas of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a lot, for a large part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think like, when you started coming
in heavy, like it was all a bunch of that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was still very much around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I first started coming in heavy,
I was looking for the blue widow clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking for this, the, the sweet
thing clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like, that was everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was like what everybody had
in clones, what they had in flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And seeds and all this different types of
stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Kyle was there documenting it
for high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I don't think Ron let him
actually made an article about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he wanted to keep it like on the
down low and not fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, but you know, it was
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why we're going to kind of
bounce around to all this different types
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff is that all overlaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, somebody asked about Jason King.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a probably a good time to chat
about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that time, uh, there was this guy's
name is Jason King and he had this idea
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm going to take a bunch of pictures
of famous strains and then I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: write my own super opinionated blurb about
each one of these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he called it the canna Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think anybody knew what he was
doing at the time, uh, would be,
[SPEAKER_00]: would matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what he did, which is super cool is he
came out with about three canna Bibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sort of document this whole like
late nineties through early to mid two
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands era right before the clone wars
where all these specific clones of Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel, sour, all that started just
dominating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these random hybrids started
to becoming hard to find.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so he came out with his canna Bible
and I remember getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, one of the coolest things about
the first canna Bible was that the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: first introduction, uh, is written by one
of my weed heroes, uh, Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rob did, Rob did this thing where he
wrote this big introduction into the canna
[SPEAKER_00]: Bible, which honestly, I don't,
I'm not sure anyone could have done that
[SPEAKER_00]: and given as much legitimacy to Jason King
as Ron Clark writing a big long seed
[SPEAKER_00]: history and clone history introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I've said before,
Ron wrote the Bible for seed breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob, sorry, Rob, Rob, Ron, Rob Clark wrote
the Bible for seed breeding, marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: botany.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote his sheesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he's legendary.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an encyclopedic knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's definitely like one of the elders of
the whole marijuana thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, he's made lasting
contributions to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so him writing that and what he did is
he outlined which strains, which was a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge debate even back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which strains went to Amsterdam as clone
onlys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which strains went to Amsterdam as
seed lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a timeline of who gave what,
that was kind of brief, but who gave what
[SPEAKER_00]: over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a timeline of like all these
different seed companies and what years
[SPEAKER_00]: they release different versions of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: They hit his chart on the, uh,
release the seed companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the first time I'd heard of like
lowland seeds and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pearl stuff is him, someone's asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pearl is all the pearl stuff is related to
Rob.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so for a lot of us that you're
trying to piece together all this shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's a guy in the know that knows all
these various seed companies and breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: and work and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, he, he outlines this
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you know, so he, so he comes out
with this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He writes this big long thing,
which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my favorite part of the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to the rest of the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the rest of the book,
is a bunch of Jason's opinionated comments
[SPEAKER_00]: on different pictures of weed he's taken
and what he thinks about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: From all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get this thing and, uh, I'm super
nerded out by it and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, uh, flash a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was this gentleman who,
uh, just passed away not that long ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, um, his name was Eddie Lep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Eddie Lep had a farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: An upper lake, which is about 20 minutes
from my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he grew a bunch of weed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he really blew it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, he's one of the, he's one of the
best best.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the early biggest flaunters
of two 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm going to follow the law,
come get me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people, um, that,
uh, a lot of people met there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I met Jason King, uh, both there
and I, I should, should say at some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those early Ron parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we became good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, through, you know, through those
connections, through hanging out at Ron's
[SPEAKER_00]: parties and then through, um, you know,
he was, he was a photographer and trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to document weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody back then was fascinated
that Eddie Lep was willing to fill a field
[SPEAKER_00]: full of cannabis and be like, come get me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so, you know, and, and,
and, so I decided to help Jason with his,
[SPEAKER_00]: with his project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to make a second can of Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd lived in Mendo at that point,
a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Matt, as you're well aware,
uh, weed was weed world was still
[SPEAKER_00]: insulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get a bunch of
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're not going to meet all the right
people without an end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still kind of that way for the old
school guys though.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, nothing hard to talk to,
but nothing like it was before you
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't even find how to contact an old
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least now they have like maybe an IG
page or some, some way you can track them
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first got into this, I remember I
tried tracking out DJ short to speak to
[SPEAKER_03]: him, you know, no dice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to find where he was going to be
speaking and see him in person.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to get ahold of it at that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll, we'll bounce, we'll bounce
around just so everybody knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about Eddie and that,
and that whole era, because that's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, so these things will all overlap
because they're all going on basically at
[SPEAKER_00]: the exact same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ron's parties, uh, Eddie's scene at an
upper lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the stuff that I haven't talked to,
canna Bible, all this stuff is all like
[SPEAKER_00]: happening and, and, and as part of the
same flow, same few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so I become friends with Jason and
I decide to, um, help him with his
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, get him introductions to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let him meet other people that can help
him kind of navigate through humble Mendo,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and document and all that type of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result of all that, um,
you know, and I should say this is that I,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty good friends with Jason back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't, we've drifted apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's lived on Maui now for a long time and
I don't go to Hawaii or haven't since I
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've kind of drifted apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still on good terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's a super opinionated guy and he
used to drive some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there are people that will be like
that guy drives me fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always got along well with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of that, I was very sympathetic
to what he was trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just another weed nerd trying to fucking
put the pieces together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I strongly disagreed with them about
certain things and all that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we would battle about, you know,
all kinds of shit, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's not, that's not any different
than today with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but he was documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of, there's a lot of
things in there, you know, like you talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about like the bull, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff that fell off the
wayside that's documented.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, and so I started helping him
figure out this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, and, and, you know, and me and
Eddie and some other different folks,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, started helping them put together the
Canna Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by helping, I just mean making
introductions and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: can this dude with a camera come to your
scene?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's kind of crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have some trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I bring a dude with a fucking camera?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To your scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, and just so people get an
idea, this is pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I remember, uh, Jason got a 12
megapixel camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a super nice lens on it to start
taking pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the first Canna Bible was all film,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 12 megapixel camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 megapixel camera with a super nice lens
was over $11,000 that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dead serious, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over $11,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was at his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually rented this house from Eddie
Lepp that was in Lake County, not at Eddie
[SPEAKER_00]: Lepp's property, but a separate home he
owned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used to, like I said, I lived 20
minutes in there for, we were,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we were together all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, like I, like I said
before about Rob, about Ron's parties at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time, I was growing the super skunk,
um, the, uh, the, the chem dog 91,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Mendo perps, uh, the black,
the black Domino, the snow, the Trinity,
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of the super dog crosses and
hybrids, um, all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I start helping them get
all this stuff photographed and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and documented and, you know, and it was
pretty neat in that regard, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: because uh, you know, they, um,
there's a lot of stuff that was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but there's a ton that's in those
books, but there's video, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: picture evidence and there's various
aspects.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, so, um, if people are
interested because of that close
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship, um, I had a bunch of stuff
that ended up in that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, the, I grew the dog both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in this process then of growing a
bunch of my favorite strains, completely
[SPEAKER_00]: organic and then full of salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in the same room at the same time,
right next to each other and then doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of blind taste tests with me and my
friends and trying to actually see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, so there's, there's, uh,
the chem 91 is in there as both dog and
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dog grown both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my Mendo perps is in there,
the snow, the Trinity, my super dog seven
[SPEAKER_00]: cut that I lost is in there, which is a
hybrid between the, uh, myself and the guy
[SPEAKER_00]: from Staten Island made this line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a super skunk chem dog
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the purple effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, which is, uh, Mendo perps crossed with
FX, which is a cool story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, actually somebody said coral reef.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not mine, but, uh, our buddy Fletch
has been hunting for that for a super long
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody knows where the coral reef
is, uh, hit us up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, like that, that, that,
um, that super dog thing is, is the odd
[SPEAKER_03]: connection that me and you have where I
spent years and years and years trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: figure out who made the fucking super dog
by asking around the whole chem fam,
[SPEAKER_03]: all that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at one point I couldn't get any
fucking answers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like half to half the people would say,
yes, it's diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just another day.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't turn out to be that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I remember before we made it,
we met, I remember in 2010, I made a super
[SPEAKER_03]: dog 2010, trying to recreate what I had
read about in the Canna Bible because I
[SPEAKER_03]: could never fucking find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And many, many years later, when we
finally interacted, I had realized you
[SPEAKER_03]: were the source of the super dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was really interesting because it
was such a big, long chase for me because
[SPEAKER_03]: of that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, I mean, I don't really want to
tell the story of how I lost it all,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, I, I remember like, I mean,
I had it at all those Ron parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I passed it out freely to a bunch of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I gave a bunch of super dog hybrids,
uh, to Mandelbrot and it ended up being a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the basis of a lot of his males,
uh, that he started using to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even back then everyone had to use
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, not that everybody doesn't use pollen
today, but everybody had to use like
[SPEAKER_00]: males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like full regular males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reversals were six, seven, eight years
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, um, so, uh, I didn't even,
we didn't even know it was the only
[SPEAKER_00]: reversal is anyone ever heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is accidental herms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes if people wanted to make
accidental herms, they would torture their
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would beat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would make it dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would make it almost die.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would fuck with its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would just torture it and see,
can I get it to pop a bunch of pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, yeah, like I don't have,
like I lost the super dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost the purple effects, but there's
write-ups in that book of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is pretty neat because then there's,
there's at least pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it got documented and why we,
we still know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should tell, I should tell a funny
story just because so, uh, Jason had this
[SPEAKER_00]: girlfriend named Rebecca back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, he, uh, she was from North
Carolina and they had this strain that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is semi known right now called the
mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was this old ass weird sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and Jason just raved and raved and
raved about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he got his girlfriend's friends to
mail it to him in, uh, in Lake County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're thinking today, you know,
with all the mailing tech that people
[SPEAKER_00]: have, you're thinking some like small
innocuous package or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, this fucking thing shows up and
it's a box that's about a foot,
[SPEAKER_00]: a foot wide and a foot, you know,
this and two feet deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big fucking box, you know,
and we open it up and inside are two
[SPEAKER_00]: motherships with a bunch of, with a bunch
of stuffing around them in one gallon pots
[SPEAKER_00]: tied to stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, they're like 18 to 24
inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of the person mailing us cuts,
they mailed us like one gallon pots of
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt and 18 to 24 inch tall plants in the
box.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all there was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You open the box and it's like two plants
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was so unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I don't think the post office was
hip yet to like weed and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially plants in the mail sending big
ass plants in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's actually in that Canna Bible,
there's some, uh, there's some pictures of
[SPEAKER_00]: that mothership because I was one of the
first people that grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because I actually had running grow
rooms and there's pictures of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mothership at Eddie Lep's property.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's pictures of the mothership from my
greenhouses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really unusual plant,
but, but yeah, it got mailed to us in the
[SPEAKER_00]: most sketch way imaginable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember in Canna Bible, I think it was
the mothership that at one point Jason
[SPEAKER_03]: King was trying to say, this has to be
related to HB 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I've never tasted anything like
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of those extreme speculations
that he was, uh, I mean, I, I should say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's my friend and everything like
that, but you read the descriptions of
[SPEAKER_00]: like the dog and the chem dog and
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I even wrote down like lineage and
history for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when he went to do his artistic
interpretation of what he wanted to write,
[SPEAKER_00]: you read it and you're like, oh,
that's fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, but that happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: People talk about all this journalist
quoted me incorrectly or totally out of
[SPEAKER_00]: context or whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but at least that's a documentation
and it was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and what, so one thing I'll say,
and then we'll move on and we'll talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about Eddie's situation,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, um, so we did, uh, now I'm going
to lose my train of thought, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, Jason, um, decided to do a can of
Bible release party for the second can of
[SPEAKER_00]: Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he decided to invite everyone that it
contributed to the book with pictures,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone that helped him put together
and a who's who.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, they, uh, and he rented out this
very, this very magical place,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I don't know if most people have
heard of, there's this place called or
[SPEAKER_00]: springs in Mendocino County and it's a
natural hot springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, so it's got all these
like cabins in the woods and stuff and all
[SPEAKER_00]: this beautiful redwood and it's right next
to the monk.
Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm saying yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's right next to Montgomery
woods, which has some of the tallest trees
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think three out of the five tallest
redwoods are all in Mendocino County right
[SPEAKER_00]: next to this, this hot springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty magical place, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So he does this thing where he throws this
three day can of Bible release party,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all get to come and we all have our
little rented cabins and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing, like one of Ron's parties,
essentially it's a bunch of seed swapping
[SPEAKER_00]: and trading and all this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Eddie Lep's there and, and Rob Clark's
there and, and you know, uh, Caleb and
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean, like all, just all the people I
already mentioned, a lot of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: people are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people that contributed to
the book, Eddie Lep, his whole entourage
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these folks, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to meet, uh, one of my heroes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to meet DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of mine that I got to meet too.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a coincidence.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and that was, that was kind of
intense because, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we've mentioned on previous podcasts,
you know, if you're a weed nerd on the
[SPEAKER_00]: forums, you've got all the, this is way
pre cookie too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got all these like, you know,
test grows and stuff on the forums of all
[SPEAKER_00]: these beautiful blue families,
hybrids and blue and blue work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, Holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm in my mid twenties or
whatever and DJ is significantly older.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you feel like you're meeting an
elder and you're just starting to fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my buddy from Staten Island and
myself, we've been breeding for a number
[SPEAKER_00]: of years at that point with our super dog
and different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we find it felt like we were just
getting started and here's this guy that's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, was released in Europe in the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worked with Sag Martha, worked with Dutch
passion, had Canadian stuff, had this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole movie and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody back then was kind of on his
jock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he was kind of a famous guy then,
you know, he was internet famous,
[SPEAKER_00]: him, hempy, Vic high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, there was some really like
famous internet personalities on those
[SPEAKER_00]: early forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was DJ's work was one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stood out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was one of the first American
breeders since the readers who first
[SPEAKER_00]: brought their stuff over to Amsterdam,
like Sam and Rob and all those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like the next wave of people that
got famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there wasn't that much competition
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say hempy, hempy was a fucking,
he had a lot of good points, but man,
[SPEAKER_00]: was he a tough character?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dickhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a, he was, he was, if you said
something, I mean, a lot of those guys
[SPEAKER_00]: like Tom Hill and stuff, if you said
something ignorant, they just tear your
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking head off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He can't even be put in that same
category.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: He made me stick as an idiot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to deal with him too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I, um, you know, DJ is at this,
at this Canna Bible release party,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he shows up at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all excited, but to him, it was
probably like, there was a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a custody, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he shows up and he's got Manila,
little Manila envelopes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: with just, you know, 50 and a hundred of
all his lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I think back then was only four or
five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was only a few lines at a time that he
would ever sell.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were super expensive for,
for the time too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had blueberry, um, and he had,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Flow and blue velvet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe the moonshine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue moonshine or old time moonshine.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was blue moonshine, blueberry,
flow and blue velvet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, CSI and I get to talking to
him, you know, and, uh, I have to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's still around and stuff and all
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's going to be kind of irritated at
me, but, um, it was my first experience
[SPEAKER_00]: with realizing that a lot of these old
time breeders don't know that much.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I thought here I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's, this guy's been doing it 15,
20 years longer than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's made all these amazing
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's getting all these amazing
hybrids out of them and he's releasing all
[SPEAKER_00]: these inbred lines and who doesn't like
the word juicy fruit tie or purple tie or
[SPEAKER_00]: this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're all fucking pumped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start talking to him and he's
vague as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like super vague.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's, um, I think that is one thing that I
have found with people that whose opinion
[SPEAKER_03]: I respect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody that has met DJ short,
including me has had the same experience,
[SPEAKER_03]: except that he, uh, with me, he just told
me, I don't own my own company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, you know, he wasn't,
he wasn't, he was open and he talked for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time and we talked for hours over
multiple days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was super jovial and, and, and
conversational and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't, he wasn't like we were talking
about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but, but, you know, I kind of
feel like having, being a weed nerd myself
[SPEAKER_00]: and talking to tons of breeders,
um, if there's one thing you can do,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can talk in detail about your own
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to, cause it's your
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you're fucking a weed nerd
and you're fucking into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's your passion and you,
and you know, and you can just do that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit off of memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need, and he just kept saying
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'd have to go back and look at my
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to check my notes and,
you know, I'd ask him like, why didn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, did you ever, did you ever
backcross or did you ever use any of your
[SPEAKER_00]: original genetics again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, no, you know,
he's like, at the time he was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have thousands of seeds,
but they're so old and I haven't stored
[SPEAKER_00]: them well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just remember like walking away
from there and, uh, just being like,
[SPEAKER_00]: just, I just thought I was going to get a
wealth of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the hours and hours that I talked
to him, I don't, I don't even know if I
[SPEAKER_00]: got too many tidbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then if you read his book,
now it's going to sound like I'm dissing
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very, very rudimentary way of
growing inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the one thing I will say that I think
is super cool about his book is he does
[SPEAKER_00]: describe a bunch of, uh, uh, weed that he
smoked when he was younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite part of the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then he also does this thing where
he has this, I mean, we didn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: no one used the word terpenes back then,
but he tried to make like an olfactory
[SPEAKER_00]: chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a smells chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And break down what smells are related to
what.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really good chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, it was a fantastic chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend it still, because
anything that trains you to speak about
[SPEAKER_00]: things in language is helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, he was talking about like
squirrel cage fans and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's kind of like, you know,
he kind of grew in trailers in Oregon and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and used tech, used very eighties tech and
never really advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be that as it may, despite being very
disappointed by talking to him about
[SPEAKER_00]: things, I still bought like 400 and 450 of
the seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every line he had the velvet, the
moonshine, the blueberry, the flow I
[SPEAKER_00]: bought, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: 75 to 150.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I, and I, I went home and I grew
them all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think is the name of the book is
like cultivating exceptional cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right off the top of my head, something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really pretty flow plant or
something on the cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extremely purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a flow, but some other people
have said it's a blue satellite too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's some, some, some
discrepancies on that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the things, I mean,
when you interviewed, uh, Chimera and red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, you know, one of the things
that Chimera is good friends with DJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's not going to say anything rude,
but what he did say is he kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: basically admitted that he thought that
everything that he had was like the same
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just different express,
like DJ would see an expression within the
[SPEAKER_00]: line and he would be like, Oh,
this is its own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's blue velvet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I just breed stuff with expressions
like that, it's its own thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's not really what was going on
either because he was crossing opposite
[SPEAKER_03]: to, to opposite when he was doing line
breeding, working directional,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is what you don't do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very artistic take on breeding for
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he, and, and, in fairness,
like we said before, I, they were writing
[SPEAKER_03]: the book as they were going, you know,
like these were guys just getting into can
[SPEAKER_03]: of reading.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no books to be had, you know,
at the time when DJ was doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So mad props to him for fucking doing what
he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to, uh, work at the bunch of
his work that I'm stoked on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm not as stoked on his, uh,
human work, um, as far as human breeding,
[SPEAKER_03]: but other than that, you know,
like as far as cannabis breeding,
[SPEAKER_03]: I owe a big debt of gratitude to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not, but I just, you know,
it's one of those like he, that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: conundrum, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that you see all this amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see how it all works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew out, imagine people listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew out 450 seeds over the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, I'd like to say I found
a few keepers that I miss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, it, it was unbelievably beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially pre cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was lavenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was blues.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was pink.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was various shades of in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have a lot of Terps,
uh, and it didn't have a very potent high
[SPEAKER_00]: most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but when I out-crossed it to different
things, I got way better weed than
[SPEAKER_00]: anything of the pure lines I got from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine how fucking excited I
am, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now there's no seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no middleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I'm getting handwritten Manila
envelopes from the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real deal Holyfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to find the fire?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it comes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Labeling, backing everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know how it goes when you're
running hundreds of things and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep track of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a, it's a huge pain in the
ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just recently did that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people are talking about,
you know, popping 450 seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the, in the chat, not finding anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just recently popped almost the same
amount of, uh, stuff from, from,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, blue lines and, uh, went through all
of it and it had a very similar
[SPEAKER_03]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I, I, I will say something because
there is some, there is like a,
[SPEAKER_00]: an economic aspect that we don't talk
about, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where back then, um, you know,
most fire indoor was, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: four to 4,500.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw flower and have a side room or two
with a couple of lights in each for
[SPEAKER_00]: experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the, the rate, you know,
a, a 12 lighter kid was, was everything
[SPEAKER_00]: you needed in life if you want it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, the economics were really easy to
allow people to experiment and fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now things are super tight and it's gotten
quite hard and mathematics and economics
[SPEAKER_00]: are much more difficult right in this
particular period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but back then, you know, it was like,
that's what kept the cropping from being
[SPEAKER_00]: boring.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from the chat, but it's a good
question and relevant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did that Swami guy come from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was he around when you were hanging out?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's weird to see Swami.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's pretty recognizable
character.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you wouldn't have even if you
didn't become friends with them or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, like you wouldn't have mistaken
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we'll get, we'll get to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to, I don't want to break it
up, but we'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when we talk about the authenticity
part in a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as, as far as that goes, because
there's a bunch of people that one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things about cannabis I'll talk about
super briefly is that you can just sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: step out of the shadows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people are like, I don't believe
where this person came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm, I'm, I'm who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have known it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, it's, it's one of those
things where, uh, there's a lot of shady
[SPEAKER_00]: characters in cannabis and there's a lot
of, and there's a lot of people who make
[SPEAKER_00]: good and bad opinions about people on the
internet that you have never met and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't hang out with in real life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Matt and I are friends in real
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like we're real life friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made real love to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you know, platonically,
from a distance, you know, all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, it's different and you
have a bunch of people who become fanboys
[SPEAKER_00]: or girls of different people and attack
whoever they want to and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it becomes difficult because
they don't know their enemy and they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know their friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know like a social media construct of
that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but we'll get to that in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scrolling back, you've got,
you've got Ron's party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being sort of a nexus for this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got, uh, you've got the cannabis
parties, which were another nexus,
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing people together, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was, I have to say, I was super
disappointed because I really feel like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if you take home 450 seeds from
four different lines, from a breeder and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you don't find anything you really
think or want to keep, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he gave me a good deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like I paid full custody because
I'm at the, but he liked to make money
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the, the, yeah, but the, the,
the size of the room, the amount of just
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that goes into the economics
are growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, like I talked before,
it was like, you know, there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's eight or 10 American elites of NL
five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran 60, 70 NL five days and didn't find
any of those keepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other people did.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so DJ was a disappointment just in the
sense that he comes from like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, a different generation of weed nerd,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they're just not that deep into
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, one thing you can say
about Rob Clark or Sam Skunkman,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's whether or not you want to believe a
bunch of what they say or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're heavy on detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the old, a lot of the old guys
you talk to, um, you know, they're light
[SPEAKER_00]: on detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't remember or they try to make it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they just don't like, it's even the
same thing with like the sour stories or a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the stuff that happened in the
nineties that we try to get to the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know it was going to be
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure DJ thought he was always
going to be important based on having met
[SPEAKER_03]: him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure he always believed he was
going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like I said, over that weekend,
I probably talked to him for five,
[SPEAKER_00]: six hours, seven hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were there for three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we were doing was like, literally
smoking weed and hanging out and shooting
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit and eating food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have loved to have had that
opportunity with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, it just seemed so not interested
in discussing anything with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, it was, it was hard because I
did look up to him so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not that I lost respect for him,
but it's just like, the more I learned
[SPEAKER_03]: about breeding hands on, the more I
learned about why his lines turned out the
[SPEAKER_03]: way they did and why I was having such a
hard time working those lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it all made sense in the end.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I don't, I'm not dissing
him because like you're fucking around in
[SPEAKER_00]: the seventies or eighties or even in the
nineties or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you learn as you go,
you know, you bottleneck something when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's early on and that's what you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, I'm not dissing him by any
means because there's a lot, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's, I think his lines are overly
inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely overly inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the most fire weed at those
Ron parties was out-crosses of blue,
[SPEAKER_00]: of blue work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nothing wrong with having an
inbred kind of unique to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: scene line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes some out-crossing to really
bring out its true character.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's kind of what breeders would
want something very stable and worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't think that's a diss
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, do I wish that DJ would
have repopulated his juicy tie and his
[SPEAKER_00]: purple tie and his original lines every
four or five years and kept fresh seed of
[SPEAKER_00]: the original things?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I wish he was interested in them and
didn't just let them go to shit even
[SPEAKER_00]: though he had them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, I mean, everybody looks
back on when they were younger and was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, boy, do I wish I did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, who doesn't have those regrets
about their twenties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't even remember what
happened in my twenties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shit's fucked up, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, all these cannabis Bible things are
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all getting documented in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Eddie Leps was another place that was
kind of like Ron's parties or the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Bible parties where, um, people overlapped
a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people wanted to come out and see
this guy is growing a thousand pounds in
[SPEAKER_00]: his front yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a wild one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, now it's like, it sucks because,
you know, uh, what happened to him is he
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up going to jail for 10,
him and his wife ended up going to jail
[SPEAKER_00]: for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you see gardens way bigger than
his all over the place now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he didn't, people should know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't just go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did this crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably worth mentioning where
the law said you were allowed to have six
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and a 10 by 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he mapped out his farm in 10 by 10
grids and he collected, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, he collected medical cards
for each grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each medical card was tied to a
specific grid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could give him your strains to
grow in that grid and he would do a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount of work, like feed it and
water it and this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, you could come out there and do
your own D Lee thing and your own various
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect of different things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put in more work if you wanted
to and really make your 10 by 10 nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was, I don't need to get
into that part of it, but there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: split between him and you, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, honestly, it's like, he didn't just
like blow it up and go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He literally had 10 by 10 plots with six
plants per plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a medical card and he would just
stack hundreds of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was just challenging the government to
challenge their own, like little gray
[SPEAKER_03]: areas of the law is what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty punk rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super punk rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super rebellious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wanted to have Eddie Lep gardens
all up and down the fucking the highway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He literally felt like most people
wouldn't be able to grow their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why couldn't you come bring your
medical card to Eddie Lep's collective?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grow your own fairly near your house
where you could go tend to your plants on
[SPEAKER_00]: the weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and what happened to him was he
he had this huge plot in his front yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to dig him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some posters from him and a bunch of
pictures and stuff, but it's too hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: show like on the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, he.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last year he had he decided
to get seven acres across Highway 20 from
[SPEAKER_00]: his house in Upper Lake and he was going
to grow about 13 acres of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thirty two thousand plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a lot for the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thirty two thousand plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All with all with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I begged him not to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was like, dude, I don't think
the DEA, I don't think I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll let you get away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they'll come down and they'll bring
the hammer down, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some photos of that are in the Canna Bible
100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole thing on Eddie in the
Canna Bible, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there's definitely pictures
throughout the Canna Bibles that are from
[SPEAKER_00]: Eddie's spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably won't recognize them if you
hadn't been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so I begged him not to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other friends begged him not to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was other people that thought
he'd be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were really pushing their
boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they were pushing it hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he got raided by the DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cost him a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: With thirty two thousand plants,
you know, and he he him and his wife got
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 year sentences.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten year federal federal sentences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the shit the shitty thing about
federal sentences is that you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: serve 85 percent of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like the state where you can get
off halfway for good behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was a Vietnam vet and him and his
wife were older.
[SPEAKER_00]: His wife passed away in prison,
sadly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he got out and, you know,
the world had changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went from being this like rebel
maverick kind of center of attention,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, to be honest, he was kind of
egotistical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, you know, he tried to form a
cannabis church.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you know, he was fucking that's,
you know, a lot a lot of characters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he got out and the world had changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's all these motherfuckers doing
gardens his size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he gave up you know,
he gave up a lot for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got hammered pretty fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people that I mean, I'll mention a
few people, I guess, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the one of the Skittles crew that
like that spun off into dying breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was his own person, Shiloh,
probably a bunch of people know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like the second person in Mendo that
Shiloh met.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him in Dallas, who's got enough,
you know, who he works with now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both were working at Eddie's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bunch of people that became
kind of well known later that were kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: Eddie's farmhands back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because it was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't the most organized character
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine, you know, he was
definitely king of his hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he spent a ton of time entertaining
and being himself, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're trying to grow thousands
of pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, and but we were
all young then.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us hadn't none of us had really
made our names anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was all people that,
you know, it was just it was a smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so but Eddie had a bunch of parties at
his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a bunch of gatherings at his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of people from Spyrock and Bell
Springs would come down because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: shocked that he could they did big shit up
there, but they live such a crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could do it literally like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can still I drive by his house pretty
often still.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it from the highway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: His old house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: His old house that he lived at for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the house that's in the Canna
Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it was like a who's who of
legalization guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should I should say something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, his last years, Jack Herrera
moved and got a house right down the
[SPEAKER_00]: street from Eddie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Passed by that house to Eddie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Herrera was at a bunch of those
parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some signed books by him and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was over there a bunch just hanging
out, you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he had he had some health
problem right there on the 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had some health problems and some
strokes and stroke issues and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of his last years he was,
you know, he kind of had like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sometimes some parts of your
face don't work the greatest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But his mind was still there, even though
sometimes he struggled to get out certain
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, Jack is another hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a whole cannabis cup made after
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, you know, he wrote the book on the
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was it was kind of a it was
kind of a smaller world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was all those Ron's parties,
the Canna Bible parties, Eddie Lep's whole
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was all sort of like a NorCal,
you know, Emerald Triangle Lake County
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of thing that was going on,
where a lot of people were starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: come off their heels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and meet people, you know,
and it was pretty it was it was pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: integral to what came later, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was a lot of us that are our
middle age now and are trying to pass down
[SPEAKER_00]: history.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were looking up to people like Eddie
Lep or Rob Clark or Tom Hill, who is a
[SPEAKER_00]: cantankerous old man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he was like, I'd love to get him
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a little he was a little nicer in
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, man, if he didn't know you and you
said something dumb on the Internet,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he was going to he was going to
eviscerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he would eviscerate your your ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would rip it out of your asshole and
make you feel like the smallest little
[SPEAKER_00]: bitch in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are saying there's very well
there might there's people saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I might have met you back then not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very possible, you know,
that you met me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I met you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was a lot of comings and
goings then, even at those parties,
[SPEAKER_00]: at Ron's parties, like it's not like I got
to meet and like made lasting
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships with everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were 20 minute conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were in the tight circle of
people I was hanging out with all weekend
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's how it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were on the periphery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just kind of one of those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of us were none of us were
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all just a bunch of young weed
nerds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom was like, yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dordio, Tom, Tom was super nice to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you read some of the stuff when people
ask them dumb questions online and holy
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he's he was highly intelligent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people don't suffer no fools.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he was highly intelligent and he
didn't have a lot of patience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can I can definitely relate to that
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but you see that you see that even
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you get so burnt out by dealing with
people, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the same thing happened to Sam
Scumpman to some degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he was probably nicer and more
chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get you have to answer the
same 50 questions a billion times and you
[SPEAKER_00]: get accused of all this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden you're a cantankerous
old man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to fall in that category.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but those guys were all legends,
all heroes to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vic, Tom Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp, you know, these were all like
leaders of the scene, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and and old timers to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Tom's got to be I mean,
Tom's got to be 20 years older than me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe maybe I don't maybe 50s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think he's only in his 50s?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I think you're pretty old,
actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're probably older than him.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in your 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's all the oil of Olay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, keeps keeps me young or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason why I'm babbling about all
this shit is it's where a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: because there was essentially like there
was essentially like what's the best way
[SPEAKER_00]: to put it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the best way to put it is that in
the 90s, most weed scenes were very
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated to themselves to very small
circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was illegal everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one was really chatting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grateful Dead, Dead Tour, Fish Tour,
that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some overlapping things because
people would meet and not be as scared
[SPEAKER_00]: because nobody knew where anybody else
lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt's joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he's 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's lying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm definitely not 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but but, you know, I mean,
and I'll say the same thing, too,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I just saw my buddy who I was
talking to earlier today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I skunked the skunk VAs on the thing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to Ron's party and I am so hoping to
meet all these legendary people and
[SPEAKER_00]: strains and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like just hoping to get hooked up,
you know, and not to be a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I felt like I had the chem dog
and I had the super skunk and I had the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I had the best weed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like I had weed that tore people's
hat off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and and, you know, it's not to
be bragging or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was literally just the luck of
the draw and the luck of my friends.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and and dead tour, you know,
was one of those things where it was it
[SPEAKER_00]: was sort of like a huge weed emporium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made a lot of these connections and
it made a lot of these things that I tied
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole reason I came out to
Mendocino County was because I had a buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: who lived in Ukiah, which is in the heart
of Mendo, who after 215 passed was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, get the fuck out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you living in Chicago?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was literally connections from dead
tour that like brought me out here.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting back to what I was saying is
that in northern California and in dead
[SPEAKER_00]: shows, there was a weed scene and on the
forums, it developed a weed scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the Emerald Triangle, there was
kind of a weed scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these parties and these events
and stuff was sort of like the first
[SPEAKER_00]: mixers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the first places where these
scenes started to like overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the forum scene and the Mendo and
Humboldt scenes and the Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_00]: scenes and all these different groups that
have ties to different circles,
[SPEAKER_00]: they start like a Venn diagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: The circles start crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I honestly think that's set up kind of
everything for the American weed scene for
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like none of us knew it at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: By any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like we're like, oh,
we're here for history.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was just it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was the merging of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I should say even back then,
this was a few years after Ron's parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, you know, I mentioned the purple
effects that's in the that's in the Canna
[SPEAKER_00]: Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should talk about that for a
second, because people might be interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purple the purple part of purple
effects is just Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the effects was this old garlic bud
strain that I got from the head grower who
[SPEAKER_00]: worked for Tim Blake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Tim Blake now is very famous because
he's the founder of Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then he was just a big gorilla
outdoor indoor farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his his main worker was about my age.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the purple effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they gave me the effects, which was a
super golden, gorgeous, frosty,
[SPEAKER_00]: terpy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there wasn't any reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how the purple effects got made in the
Canna Bible is that I had a system that
[SPEAKER_00]: got a little stressed because I had an air
conditioner issue and it took me a few
[SPEAKER_00]: days to get it fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as CSI will tell you,
you stress the Mendo perps and the fucker
[SPEAKER_00]: will hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Mendo perps hermed all over the
effects that was right next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And me and a buddy got about a thousand
seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight hundred to a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at the time, we were hella pissed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we got that many was
because we had like these six or seven
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter pound, six ounce effects plants
all around it that we couldn't sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're chock full of fucking seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we cracked this thing and it ends up
being super terpy, you know, and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ended up in the Canna Bible was
gorgeous weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I should say that there's
been some battles amongst the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of that weed exists still.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost it in a bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of that weed exists still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in it's in the Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the Sprite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got passed around at some of Tim
Blake's early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, people should know that Tim
Blake had this spot called Area 101 in
[SPEAKER_00]: north of Leytonville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he threw a bunch of weed events up
there and he threw a bunch of like
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially like weird raves and different
kinds of like musical gatherings and and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of like a scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the first half of a dozen
Emerald Cups were all super local events
[SPEAKER_00]: held there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I passed out a bunch of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a gentleman that used to work up
there and used to work at reggae a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: called Fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not his real name, but that's his
nickname.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and all that and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, he ended up getting the
purple effects for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's who the, you know, Tony Mendo
and those guys got it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got blended into Skittles and it
got got all these different things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it lives today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but that was a total that was
before FEMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was literally an unintentional fuck
up where in summertime, the AC went out
[SPEAKER_00]: for two days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it got hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put a new AC in and everything
was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Mendo P just threw through
pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had and I had a feminized cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are asking, what about California
Black Rose?
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as I know, it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened to them is like a lot of
cannabis terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rose is trademarked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rose is a very specific kind of wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's also another seed company that
has a totally different line called Rose
[SPEAKER_03]: as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Relentless.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not related to, I don't think
it's related to the same Dime Group one,
[SPEAKER_03]: but don't quote me now that I think of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had to change it because they got
because as you get legal and you start
[SPEAKER_00]: entering these things and stuff,
you start getting sued.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Girl Scout Cookies and Thin Mint
is cookies because they got fucking sued
[SPEAKER_00]: by the Girl Scouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the reason why Skittles has Zs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is they're trying to skate
around these these trademark laws.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rose is Russian OG crossed with
Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross the purple effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the E.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took second place, I don't know,
three, four years ago or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I got out of them and this one's
been I think I have a screenshot of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Russian Kush Oz Kush effects
crossed back to Skittles is the claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they had the seeds that they had were
purple effects seeds from from fuzzy that
[SPEAKER_00]: was from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because back then it was like there wasn't
any I mean, in this same time frame,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say this, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, my buddy from me and Skunk
V.A.'s old friend who with the Kems and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, we were working on these Superdog
projects together and crossing them to all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of different hybrids and clone only
as we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my buddy Mabel brought at the time who
wasn't into seeds or breeding wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: get started with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up giving him a bunch of seeds
and a bunch and some clones to get him
[SPEAKER_00]: started on this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he ended up becoming pretty well
known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the stuff he got famous for was
based off that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it was a little different from
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the the the reason I brought that up
isn't to like lay claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to say that back then we were very
free with trading things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because no one ever thought that they
could come out of the woodwork and lay
[SPEAKER_00]: claim to anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's all like fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't breed with my cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want Matt knows this more than me
because I've avoided so far a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed politics by giving away a bunch of
seeds for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you sell seeds like Matt,
you end up getting, you know, I want half
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds because you use my cut in this
one cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want rep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to mention me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to give me money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have permission jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have so many blow jobs I've had to give
just because of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, you know, I mean, do what you
love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you love.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's what I'm good at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, so there, you know,
there's an aspect of politics,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this was before that politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just swap seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just swapped, you know,
people just swapped cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: People swapped, you know, all this
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like, you know, you didn't want
your name attached to weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then they'd fucking find you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you'd be you'd get you'd get in
fucking you'd get you'd get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Named after you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck is crazy, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and now now it's come full
circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one hundred and eighty degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like someone's like,
I didn't breed this cut, but I did make it
[SPEAKER_00]: famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, if you're making any money
off it, you must give me money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rule of the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's in my terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want rep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want all three and all this different
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just like those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's even like, you know,
people were asking way earlier on the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that I have to sign a disclosure for
D.J.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: D.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: came up with all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do anything with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way fucking later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, there was no at the time,
there was no I mean, people should give
[SPEAKER_00]: credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I just saw a homie
mention that people should give credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should say that I got this from this
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you also should if you got a cut
from somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should give it back to them if they
lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really good etiquette.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've had multiple things that
I've lost and I've tried to get back from
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned the purple effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get it back without trading other
things for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I think is super shady and a breach
of the code, at least the code.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came up, you're definitely supposed
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some half the reason people trade
things is so you don't lose things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because angry girlfriend, angry boyfriend,
bust, fire, landlord, moving, accident,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, you know, all those different
types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you trade things back amongst
people, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one of the reasons, you know,
I'll say this because he's because he's
[SPEAKER_00]: listening or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, one of the reasons why the
Chem 91 didn't get lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was because there was a tight group of,
you know, four or five of us myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: skunked the AIC collective, my buddy from
Staten Island who all had it and all lived
[SPEAKER_00]: in NorCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we all kept it alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people sometimes people got in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people had to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you had to get it back from
somebody or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like we were all heavily
invested in making sure these things
[SPEAKER_00]: lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's that's why a lot of these
cuts are still in our group, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like in our tight circle, because you
know, we all move around.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all fucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he said he's just saying I'll
just say I'll just say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to keep thinking because I keep
wanting to say his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to be like I have a hard
time bullshitting at pace and reading
[SPEAKER_00]: comments at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he you know, you know,
there were some people that lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my whole name, you know,
he just said that I had to give I see back
[SPEAKER_00]: the cut like five times.
[SPEAKER_00]: My whole name not so dog is because our
buddy from Staten Island drove up to see I
[SPEAKER_00]: see collective and got a bag of dog and
brought it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't the dog because dude was
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude used to party and he got mixed up and
mixed up his clones and he grew a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: room of chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like Romulan or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to get it to him back because he
was like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I'm like, no, dude,
it's not the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to call him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And homie was all excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I've never seen it look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this, you know, and I was like,
the reason why he's ever I stuck my head
[SPEAKER_00]: in the bag because I was in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the car with Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told it before and I looked up and I'm
like, it's not so dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're tripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and why?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I mean, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good because, you know,
they used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they used to be best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not, you know, there's and that I
should there's aspects to stories I always
[SPEAKER_00]: leave out because they're personal and I
don't think they're super pertinent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm just stoked for us because I
want to get both those motherfuckers on
[SPEAKER_03]: here at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be cool to get homie to get to
come talk because a lot of the story
[SPEAKER_00]: people should know and that people are
like, oh, not so it wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, that, whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the stories I have, you know,
come from Staten Island or come from Skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: VA talking to them 20 plus years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before the forums, before the fame,
before he got on and got his handle Skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: VA, you know, before the cut was getting
traded when it was just our little crew
[SPEAKER_00]: that had it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, honestly, like they don't come
from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come from my memory of like what I
remember about sitting around shooting the
[SPEAKER_00]: shit and growing weed and and doing shit
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it would be it would be a really
neat thing to do both to bridge that gap
[SPEAKER_00]: between the two of them and get them to
talk back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we've been trying to get
dude on here for a long time, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to get Skunk VA,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just so shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kind of he's kind of he's kind of
prickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I him and I were him and I
were, you know, me and and him and and
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all known each other a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, at certain point,
you know, you bury the hatchet about
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's hard being in weed and having
all these like interpersonal, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you mix business and friendship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and people have different
memories about shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it but yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke to right before the show,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk VA and I were talking about chatting
back and forth a bunch via text about some
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a ray of hope on something
that we maybe thought was long lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if if it's if it so develops,
I'll report back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what that's what we try to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like old friends trying to look out
for one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only make it through this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the people are much more
important at the end at the end of the day
[SPEAKER_00]: than the money or the fame or the
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm I'm big into people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I need enough money to survive,
you know, but I'm big into people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's I like to see my friends
doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've all, you know, all of us are
like semi autistic weed nerds in some way
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, you know, and like you it's
odd, you know, living alone or living by
[SPEAKER_00]: your, you know, living amongst,
you know, small groups of people and
[SPEAKER_00]: living weed and taking a bunch of risks
and staying secret for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like me showing my face is fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and now I show up weekly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, so I just I just
thought it would be it would be cool
[SPEAKER_00]: because this era is like right before kind
of Matt came into things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is like I apologize because I keep
trying to get shows done where I make it
[SPEAKER_00]: like more Matt's era than mine because
there's my errors were like smaller than
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an era where like, you know,
I was having a bunch of kids and had some
[SPEAKER_00]: issues or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and Matt was super engaged when I was
a little less engaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far, you know, I'm going to drag
him kicking and screaming into his era
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's mostly him talking and me
shutting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he keeps making us do these things
where it's it's a little older stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I think it's a lot,
too, because I've been, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: doing the live feed for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think for this many years,
I think people are more excited to hear
[SPEAKER_03]: from someone else for a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm excited to hear like from an era I
wasn't a part of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think nobody gives a fuck to hear
what I have to say about something I
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't a part of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't either.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's it's it's not just about
my ego on this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's good to get all aspects of
history out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's a thing,
too, where it's like I mean, we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know back in the day that the chem dog was
going to become super famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it stayed alive because our buddy
from Staten Island used to take it to like
[SPEAKER_00]: you could meet him outside of any Jerry
show outside the war field and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: buy a four hundred dollar ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, all that you could,
you know, when when Jerry Garcia died,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and he decided and, you know,
Skunk VA came back to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he got cuts from a homie and he
started he started growing because all of
[SPEAKER_00]: a sudden he was settled down.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't traveling and seeing shows and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where some of his Polaroids
come from of that old skunk cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, a small group of
us were growing the dog and we were always
[SPEAKER_00]: we called it, you know, no one called the
Chem 91 and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all like later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all called it the dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Skunk VA and our buddy from
Staten Island, they mostly grew organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't want to call their weed
chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't going to call it the chem
dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that picture, I think that picture
of the super skunk, for me, at least,
[SPEAKER_03]: and what I'm interested in is one of the
most important pictures that anybody could
[SPEAKER_03]: have kept that and some of the Josh D.O.G.
pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, those are specifically the sour
picture and pictures of sour pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: The old super skunk super super fucking
important for solving that weird mystery
[SPEAKER_03]: of like, was this super skunk cut the same
as the original super skunk cut?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was hard to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helped a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a thing, too, like part of
the, you know, we don't need to go over it
[SPEAKER_00]: again, but we'll talk about it just really
briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about like Ron's parties and
these and the triangle and the dead scene
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the whole reason that the Francine
got taken out east and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the super skunk came west.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that stuff was all because of
Jerry shows that our friend and skunk VA
[SPEAKER_00]: were at and friends of his from back east
and smoking weed together at the show and
[SPEAKER_00]: then people wanting that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't need to, you know,
I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to tell that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, that's that's he's told
that story pretty eloquently and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is it is showing how those circles
overlapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and one led to the other and
stuff like that, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's lock in Skunk VA for next week,
next Friday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunk VA will be on and he will be happy
to be performing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he said, I don't know if
we locked him in, but if we did,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to chat again this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a I have a line on something I
thought was long lost that's dear to both
[SPEAKER_00]: of our hearts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying my damnedest to make sure I
can get it back to all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I do believe I'm not
particularly superstitious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do believe in it and the energy of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do believe in the universe a bit
like making things come to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can say for everyone out there,
for me at least, the number one way that
[SPEAKER_00]: you get the cuts that you want and you get
the things that you want in cannabis is by
[SPEAKER_00]: treating the plant the right way and
having the right intentions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I say, because that that's
going to long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to get the right people to
trust you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to lead to what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do believe the plant has an energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do believe the plant wants to wants
to, you know, wants to find people that
[SPEAKER_00]: will keep it safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no I can't prove it, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe that there's collectors out
there and the plant hides in places where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hoping that someone cares about it
and isn't just monetarily attached to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but loves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and a lot of the things that I
have I wouldn't have because I would have
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten rid of them as soon as they were
unpopular.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I personally liked them and cared
about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's friends of mine that feel
the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why they have their shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's it's a general theme among our
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a theme, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get it's like you get trusted
in circles and you know, maybe we can go
[SPEAKER_00]: into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an aspect of like authenticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to talk about before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we are kind of getting an hour and
a half into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we can talk a little bit about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's there's aspects of things
where now that I'm being public.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm starting to tell some of these
stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say that there's a lot of things
that maybe like five or 10 percent of the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed community knows pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That becomes difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where how do you let the other 90 percent
know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of like accepted facts
among small groups of people that want to
[SPEAKER_00]: trade this kind of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want to get it out there and
you get fucking attacked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, Matt can attest that he
tried to get me to do this for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, well, I mean, you were just
watching what happened to me and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: like, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want that in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did Caleb's event up in up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it was like I showed my
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in front of a huge crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, oh, my God,
you know, I mean, I didn't give my real
[SPEAKER_00]: name, but it's still at the time it was
difficult.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it what it comes down to is that
if what convinced me to do it is is like
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't try to get some version of
the truth out there, what you believe to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the truth, then it's just going to be
overwhelmed by bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an aspect where it's like and
I really get upset about it sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's this I.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: thing where people pile on each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Matt's a villain on I.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I want to be to a lot of but to a lot
of people that don't know him in real
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and if we want to fast forward a
bit before covid, Matt and I, there was
[SPEAKER_00]: other friends that helped and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not trying to just to diss anyone
I'm not mentioning, but Matt and I and a
[SPEAKER_00]: few other friends kind of like got this
idea to throw what we called like the can
[SPEAKER_00]: Illuminati party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was sort of kind of based on Ron's
old parties and some of those old
[SPEAKER_00]: gatherings, but more modern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided to do it the same weekend
as Emerald Cup, you know, because
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody would be in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we rented a huge house and invited a
bunch of people over on Friday and
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday night of Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both years, you know, we had hundreds
of people come through the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe it or not, nobody punched
Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody attacked Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people that you that you
don't imagine that like respect him a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know about that,
but they didn't punch me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have a lot of friends,
you know, there's a lot of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a bunch of collectors and breeders
and weed nerds and people in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: that come through and want to hang out
with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to realize that like we were
trying to throw an event where it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: those guys spend all day at their fucking
booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking to customers and trying to give
their customers a little bit of one on one
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at night time, you know,
they get to come out and hang with a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of people just like them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trade weed amongst people just like
them and shoot the shit and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: trade cuts and talk about bullshit and do
all this various shit, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we really had a good time those
couple of years before Covid fucked it all
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was fun, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had, you know, we had a lot of people
we had, you know, CSI and Bodhi and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of, I mean, you could go, there was
hundreds of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's who?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody, but a lot of people,
you know, some people were busy or burned
[SPEAKER_00]: out or whatever, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were trying to recreate some of
those like more innocent time parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and, you know, and I
brought tons of weed and various friends
[SPEAKER_00]: brought tons of weed and we just have like
a huge table full of jars that were
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled and anybody could freely smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even like just like the forums,
there was a bunch of friends I made on IG
[SPEAKER_00]: that some of the first time they smoked
the headband, some of the first time they
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked the real Chem D, some of the first
time they smoked this different stuff was
[SPEAKER_00]: at these parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might hear you talk about it,
but they don't actually see your weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then they get a chance to do
it and then you get to share a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: your weed with friends and you get to do
all these different kinds of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that part is really neat because
that kind of, I wish you went to,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, we're going to have another one
after COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a, you know,
it's, it's just like a who's who of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been around for a long time and
you would not believe how little beef
[SPEAKER_00]: there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was none in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't any beef.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a bunch of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was smoking out, eating a bunch of
food, having a great time, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: trading beans, trading cuts, making
connections, putting faces to names,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that different types of stuff.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have an aspect where we've had
some issues this week where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you start having these talks week by week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, Matt's a bit of a villain
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because now I'm coming out and we
haven't even hit some of the controversial
[SPEAKER_00]: topics yet, but as I'm coming out and
talking about stuff, you start getting
[SPEAKER_00]: enemies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start getting people that are annoyed
that people are listening to you or they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't believe your version of events or,
you know, on IG or on various discords,
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to like disparage your character
and say you weren't around and say that
[SPEAKER_00]: you didn't have anything or your weed was
shit or your seeds suck or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, like it becomes really hard
because a lot of people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: listening, you don't know the person
you're siding with and you don't know the
[SPEAKER_00]: person that you're against in real life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in an honest real life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it becomes hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how do you make stuff happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was people that were
accusing me this week of not even see the
[SPEAKER_00]: chems until oh, wait.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then I came out of nowhere
and then all my stories are lies and not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just means the stories are not so.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's let's be fair, though,
like the people that were doing this were
[SPEAKER_03]: people that were in the outer circle of
our friend group and never made it quite
[SPEAKER_03]: on the in circle because they were they
were bad people and they fucked people
[SPEAKER_03]: over or they did certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Matt will come out and say,
this person's a scammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's stealing cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's trying to fuck you over.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's trying to take your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that person and like and and some
bots and like a bunch of fake accounts and
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of people that bought seeds all
attack Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's a faggot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a Jew.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a Jewish Nazi.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these various things start getting
attacked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as I become a public figure a
little bit, like they start attacking,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, is that that party is weed sucks this
and that everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: People to throw barbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not even saying you should trust
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I am saying is that, you know,
weed has a lot of people lived in the
[SPEAKER_00]: shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why we're doing a bunch of
these stories is because we want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: oral history out there and we want to do
it in a conversational fashion that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't bore you to death.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that steps on toes and then
people are furious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they can't fuck with the story.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so they'll fuck with Matt or they'll
fuck with me or they'll say you're a liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, oh, I know for a fact he didn't
touch him until after oh eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't have this or his this his
headband is watered down or whatever they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to say about Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the seven oh seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you know, and it's like you
don't want to spend all your life fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: like refuting a bunch of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because it's like everybody that
knows me knows me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and Matt and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so we're trying to get truth
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to get truth that like we're
not making any money off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of these a lot of these
podcasts are like weed infomercials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's three hours of why you should buy
my seats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk extensively about you and why
you're great and why you're integral to
[SPEAKER_00]: the story and why you're a cannabis
historian and why you're so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going to help you make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit, I should have been inserting myself
into all this old shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and it's like you do need,
you know, we do plug for two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes some stuff that Matt's doing or,
you know, CSI or different people at
[SPEAKER_00]: times, because there is a financial
element to like making all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of stuff work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: To some degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really what it is, is that now that
I'm old and I'm in my mid 40s or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: there might be people that are 23 that
want to hear or might be 40 and want to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear the real truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually you just have to
decide because there are some real
[SPEAKER_00]: scumbags that just come out and insert
themselves and then rely on if you speak
[SPEAKER_00]: up, I'll blow up your fucking life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it really worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll attack and attack and attack and
attack and I'll fuck you over and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: make your life miserable for weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shut the fuck up about what you all
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much of that, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And coming from so many fucking angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rife for sociopaths.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rife for shade balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beans have always been shady and they're
not getting any less shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're just not.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a bunch of us, you know,
who had been around long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, there's this running.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to call him out or whatever,
but like I don't even it was like a super
[SPEAKER_00]: long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like me and Skunk VA were talking
about whether or not we were going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to these like dead shows in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's telling me he's like,
man, because he was he's he's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: older than me and he was on tour for
longer than I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has more connections than I do,
to be perfectly frank, because he's about
[SPEAKER_00]: six or seven years older than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he was like, dude, we could go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's like, then I'm going to see this
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he doesn't pay his child support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to see this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he owes my friend 15 grand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to see this other guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he and you know, these people's
backstories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like, you're going to see
some people you're like so stoked on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to see some other
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just going to be like,
man, why can't you be cooler?
[SPEAKER_00]: We were friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're kind of a shitbag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay your kids, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay your child support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay my buddy back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ripped him off when you were down and
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes on in weed world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what city?
[SPEAKER_00]: San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, at the time, both him and I
lived in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lived in Sonoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were we were thinking about going
down to SF and catching some shows at
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain View or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's the thing is like a
lot of times I'll talk about things in
[SPEAKER_00]: like a general sense, because you start
calling out individual people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next week of my life is
fucking that asshole trying to defend
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and blowing themselves up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And me and homie, Matt and I, and me and
Skunk B, we know a lot of history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of it is not all of it is is
beneficial to the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you can't, you know, it doesn't
pay to spend your whole life trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: warn the fam unity about Jack off because
it's whack-a-mole.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I tried that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just it did not pay off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was detrimental to my career.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say I don't recommend people do
that for any reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatsoever, if you have an interest in
being successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I so yeah, you know,
I mean, there's there's that aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not saying trust me or trust
Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying, like, if you're giving us your
time every Friday night, you get to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: to us at length and ask questions and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, you have to maybe you can hear
enough of things that you get a general
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of who we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say that I.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: is an image and that sociopaths are very,
very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: At curating an image.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they do best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and yet someone just said
nobody's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: People aren't perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: People aren't, you know, people aren't
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not even trying to judge people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm not calling anybody out by
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm just saying a general I'm just
saying a general state of events.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have someone I was going to call out
by name, but it's it's getting late.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's one more big thing I want to I
want to get put aside.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually using their words.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm not going to say it's not even a
big enough deal, really.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it'll just be funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be for someone I've looked up to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you were about to do or you're
not.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I still need some of the some of
the details.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't want it just to be my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it to be dude's own words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, and that's kind of what we talk
about, like when people are like the can
[SPEAKER_00]: Illuminati, you know, yeah, the can
Illuminati is not like some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: organization or membership.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no dues, you know, there's no one
that controls it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it basically means is that you're
enough of a weed head, that you care
[SPEAKER_00]: enough of the history to hold on to
strains to hold on to seeds to want to dig
[SPEAKER_00]: for the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you talk to other people like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then basically, it's a it's a like
minded group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know who we other are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, even amongst that group,
there's not even really trading.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's just like, dude, like once you
know, it's like, you know, a skunk VA and
[SPEAKER_00]: I were talking earlier today about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, we're not going to trade
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, like, it's like, oh, you need a couple
of these and I can get you this or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's not like a trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more just like, you know,
you're what I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't think there's anything
wrong with trading, because trading is
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly acceptable, especially if you
don't know each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you've been personal friends for
a couple of decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just friends helping friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and a lot of the ways that this
stuff exists, like, you know, our history.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really why I'm chatting is because
I don't want all of our history to be
[SPEAKER_00]: lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I want it to be out there in some kind
of form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost all oral.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with a lot of the forums going down
over the years, whether it be from the
[SPEAKER_03]: feds, you know, getting a hold of the IC
mag server to, you know, Kana Collective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pot pimp any of the the the C Depot,
any of those that have gone down,
[SPEAKER_03]: they had a lot of information on them like
C Depot.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people that people look at today
is old school heroes and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_03]: or really trustworthy people all popped up
on C Depot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And their whole history is gone because
that's that site was gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dude disappeared after fucking
everyone over the owned it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's in a lot of people's memories.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is really the only chance we have
to put that out there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're just we're just trying to
we're just trying to, like, regurgitate
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and get it out there and get
different versions of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and and, you know, like like
anything, you know, some of these stories,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's people that have different
memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people that have different
versions, even like the three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: people that were there might not tell the
same tale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were the ones that were there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a nickname for being a power bottom
at the last party, and I'm pretty sure I
[SPEAKER_03]: was power top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but I mean, it's cool because
then you get then you get, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: these parties, these gatherings and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really are bonding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they really are where human
connections are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to smoke a bunch of your good
friends weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to see them in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to hear what their voice sounds
like and hear them laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to break bread and food with
people, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get to share weed and share
experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's, you know,
what maybe we can get the candle and
[SPEAKER_00]: candle Illuminati parties together again
now that covid seems to be dying down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of people that are either
been infected or vaccinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not so much like the plague.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was for a few years where it was
shutting shit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those kind of gatherings are
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so tonight, you know, we're almost at
two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll probably shut up here in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just wanted to give like a general
random overview of some of the overlapping
[SPEAKER_00]: things that were happening in that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really set the stage for everything
that came after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really where a lot of friendships
were made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was where a lot of trading and a lot of
seed exchange was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was where a lot of cuttings and a lot
of people smoking other people's weed and
[SPEAKER_00]: learning happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of those guys ended up
becoming super well known in the
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it it it, you know,
but you don't know it at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's that's the funny thing about
history is you don't know if you're if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're making it, you don't know,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but really what it boils down to is
we're all just people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us care about the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us care about wrapping money and
and and, you know, scamming people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a big conflict between those
two right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been one for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's gotten more public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, even like, you know,
Matt's been doxed before, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even some of those comments I was
referencing that we're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: mention this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were saying my real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I cared to some degree because
it's, you know, like I'm showing my face
[SPEAKER_00]: every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Principle of the thing, though,
you're not saying your Christian name
[SPEAKER_00]: every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not saying my Christian name every
week or anything like that, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, but but what's funny
about that is that I can use that later to
[SPEAKER_00]: prove something that would like blow them
up in the face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been pushed enough enough times
by this human being to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: just suck.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks to have to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But because they're saying such extreme
shit, like there are only a few things in
[SPEAKER_03]: life that I take for personal is when you
talk to my friends, family, or you call me
[SPEAKER_03]: a fucking Nazi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I spent my whole young life just
literally fist fighting Nazis and being
[SPEAKER_03]: punched by them many, many, many times.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I take it very seriously when someone
accuses me of such things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm a Jewish Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not there's not too many Nazi
Jews.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so anyway, Matt, if you want to do
your plug, because we're almost two hours
[SPEAKER_00]: here or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have our Patreon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called the Breeders Syndicate
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way to find it is to go to Google and
type in Breeders Syndicate Patreon.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to Patreon and type in Breeders
Syndicate, it's not going to come up
[SPEAKER_03]: because it is a pot channel and you cannot
search pot channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go to Google, type in Breeders
Syndicate Patreon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow I'm going to be watching fights.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to, you know, hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do some fight watching.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the Santa Cruz Goat Farm Fem
lines, the reversed Arcada train wreck
[SPEAKER_03]: lines up for sale right now on the site.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go check them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: My boy packs a fucking killer dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he made some killer things,
including the Santa Cruz Blue Dream train
[SPEAKER_03]: wreck, which I'm really, really stoked to
see.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have me and CSI's Hawaii Lights
drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm about to make the Hawaii Lights
hybrids public.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody can fucking join in and grab
that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go check out Speak Easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do all the editing at the podcast and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go give them support and follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just say one thing after Matt did
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're getting up to 200,
230, 250 people a week now doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: every Friday.

[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everyone, I really appreciate you
