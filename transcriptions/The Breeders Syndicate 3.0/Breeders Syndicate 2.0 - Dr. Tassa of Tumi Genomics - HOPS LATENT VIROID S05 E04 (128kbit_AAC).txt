[SPEAKER_03]: Sup everyone Sorry, I'm still getting a
set up here waiting for everyone to show
[SPEAKER_03]: up to You will be joined shortly by not so
and to me genomics and we will be doing
[SPEAKER_03]: our Talk on HPLV, so I'm pretty stoked we
made it here To this moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been sick all week, so apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little fucking slow today I'm trying
my best I really am and I didn't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: miss out on this because it's important to
me that everybody gets this info So yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: My fans allowed I think Brin's in here,
maybe Brin can help with that See I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: grab it you can Okay got not so coming in
Maybe if this works like it should there
[SPEAKER_03]: we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have to wait for casa from to me
There she goes to me genomics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me look her up now like to join to me
there we go I can invite Once she can jump
[SPEAKER_04]: in I Have a whole bunch of notes yeah,
I do really you took I'm so I am
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-prepared Can you can you guys hear me
all right absolutely I'm Matthew.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not so dog, and we are the reader
syndicate Nice to meet you guys nice to
[SPEAKER_03]: meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for inviting me on tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think I think the whole thing needs
to know more about what's going on which
[SPEAKER_03]: the with the HPLV how it's being
transmitted through clones how Rampant it
[SPEAKER_03]: is or isn't and how scared they should or
shouldn't be all of the above So I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know in a conversation like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to start with?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where would you want to start a patient
zero, or do you start with what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: dealing with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe the best place to start is to
just kind of explain what That's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: place I read is that was one of my
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought would be a good place to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes Yeah, so So what is a viroid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Viroids are one of the simplest forms of
life that exists on the planet if we can
[SPEAKER_00]: even call it life as opposed to other
organisms like bacteria or Fungus or even
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses they don't have anything on the
outside to protect Their genetic material
[SPEAKER_00]: so most organisms have like a fat layer or
a protein layer Viroids are simply a
[SPEAKER_00]: free-floating tiny piece of genetic
information, and that's all that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: so when I say tiny the human genome has
about three billion letters or base pairs
[SPEAKER_00]: Viroids have 250 so we're talking about a
really really small Life form and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people actually refer to them as Fossils
that are left over from basically the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of life when the theory is that
it was just RNA and So they're kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: remnant of that primordial earth time when
all life was replicating RNA And these
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny little things are really infectious
in plants Yeah, yeah, are they then
[SPEAKER_04]: considered are they?
[SPEAKER_04]: parasites I Mean they can't exist without
contacting some other more complex form of
[SPEAKER_00]: life right and infecting it exactly there
are they are 100% dependent on the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism to Replicate it to help it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know transport all around the plant to
do everything that it does So they're the
[SPEAKER_00]: tiniest molecular parasite that we know of
yeah And what we're working with with this
[SPEAKER_03]: current Hops latent virus or fibroid I
should say is there is a difference right
[SPEAKER_00]: there a major difference Yes, yeah,
so so just to clarify and because there is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually a hop latent virus also Just to
make things confusing But viruses have
[SPEAKER_00]: some type of outside protection For their
DNA and it's often like a protein coat
[SPEAKER_00]: that goes outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viroids are just the naked genetic
information So they are two distinct
[SPEAKER_04]: things and viruses are more complex Than
right they have more of those there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Viroids are even smaller than viruses,
correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Viruses not only do they have that
outside coat but they actually encode
[SPEAKER_00]: information that forces the cell to make
Special little molecular machines called
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes that will that will help the virus
to replicate Viroids do not encode even
[SPEAKER_00]: for a special machine so they are
completely dependent on hijacking the
[SPEAKER_00]: machines in the plant and Forcing them to
replicate the Viroid instead of doing what
[SPEAKER_04]: they're supposed to be doing so I Mean
maybe another part of the beginning and
[SPEAKER_04]: like you could talk about the beginning
for you But I thought maybe it would be
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting to talk about the beginning
for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so there was there was an answer
Like you know because I'm old or whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: like in the 90s None of the stuff that
we're probably going to talk about later
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as like, you know preventing
transmission was used people use the same
[SPEAKER_04]: razor blades There wasn't very much
disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't very much worry going on a
lot of these things were kind of unheard
[SPEAKER_04]: of and because it was a clandestine thing
and very small circles Even if a circle
[SPEAKER_04]: got infected with something it didn't
spread that much so during like the IG
[SPEAKER_04]: period we had some good friends of ours
that's that you know They would you know
[SPEAKER_04]: clone trading happens and all that right
and all of a sudden people started
[SPEAKER_04]: experiencing something that we call
dudding Yes, right duds all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant went from being healthy and
happy to unhappy And for a long time we
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't know if it was one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't know if it was a multitude of
things We just observationally could see
[SPEAKER_04]: that some plants resin production would go
away Down their health would go way down.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had some friends before they even knew
it almost reminded me a little bit of like
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when the early part of the AIDS
epidemic but in plants where people didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: know how it was transmitted people didn't
know it existed People didn't know how to
[SPEAKER_04]: take precautions for it And then by the
time that we figured out like what it was
[SPEAKER_04]: and we can start talking to people like
you it's everywhere Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I so hoplite and vibrate itself was
characterized in hops in the 80s and
[SPEAKER_00]: Because hops plants are so genetically
similar to cannabis at some point the
[SPEAKER_00]: Viroid sort of came into cannabis But
nobody knows exactly when this happened
[SPEAKER_00]: and just like you said, I suspect it's
been circulating for a really long time
[SPEAKER_00]: And the negative about that, of course,
is that by the time we realized it like
[SPEAKER_00]: you said it's everywhere and you know,
it's just been Going unchecked for so long
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's really become like a cannabis
pandemic at this and you know That's gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: lead to a lot of questions for me actually
because I think there's like there's like
[SPEAKER_04]: two things here one There's like the the
aspect of figuring out what it does Right,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then there's like best practices for
how we can slow it down, you know And one
[SPEAKER_04]: of the interesting aspects is like is that
there's a there's a thing that Matt and I
[SPEAKER_04]: called bro science Bro science where you
know, there's a lot of rumors because
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis has been in the shadows for a
long time It hasn't had the ability for
[SPEAKER_04]: like UC Davis or the University of Iowa or
various scientists to study these things
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to make we have to like observe
and guess right and so then there's so
[SPEAKER_04]: then at times then there's there's a I
think there's a lot of You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched a previous interview that you
were in and I think enormous Amounts of
[SPEAKER_04]: people were shocked when you said that
like 99% alcohol does nothing to it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: that was a big shocker Yeah, right and
then I've been in I've been in greenhouses
[SPEAKER_04]: where they had like the torches attached
to the end of like propane Canisters and
[SPEAKER_04]: they were cleaning their tools in between
and then you were like, oh that doesn't do
[SPEAKER_04]: anything very much either Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and so nothing we need to go into
all that right this second But I just mean
[SPEAKER_04]: that I think there's a lot of
misinformation Right and just like any
[SPEAKER_04]: other kind of viral Virus or anything
going around the best way to figure it out
[SPEAKER_04]: is so people know what works and what
doesn't how How do you even get infected,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know can bugs infect you?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know can touching plants infect you is
it just runoff and razor blades?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it there's a whole host of stuff that I
think most people are still pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: ignorant of yeah, and It might be it might
change over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know you seem to be someone that
like has some really Real experience and
[SPEAKER_04]: like what is actually in testing turning
out to be effective?
[SPEAKER_03]: How did how did to me come into testing
for HPLV?
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you come into testing for cannabis
anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so So basically I can just give you
a really like quick two minute background
[SPEAKER_00]: on the company So we started to me
genomics about two and a half years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was actually Started originally by
myself and my husband who is also one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the scientists in the company and one of
our entrepreneurial friends And basically
[SPEAKER_00]: we were both at the end of our postdocs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of decided academia wasn't for us
and We wanted to take what we knew how to
[SPEAKER_00]: do like all of this inventive,
you know cutting-edge science that was
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in academia and bring it into an
industry or a Geography that really needed
[SPEAKER_00]: that the tools we could make or the
information that we could share Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so we started the company and then
about a month after we started COVID hit
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything stopped and we all the
plans that we had made for our brand new
[SPEAKER_00]: startup were completely squished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So We said well, okay, we'll just jump
into COVID and see if we can help out And
[SPEAKER_00]: we started doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made a COVID diagnostic kind of a point
of care an on-site test and we ran a COVID
[SPEAKER_00]: lab for the university and kind of at a
similar time we had somebody contact us
[SPEAKER_00]: who had a grow and she was having issues
with hoplite and viroid and she couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: find You know A place where she could
reliably test or whatever and she asked if
[SPEAKER_00]: we could help out So we designed a test
for her kind of at the same time that we
[SPEAKER_00]: were also doing like a ton of QPCR testing
for COVID and it just kind of grew from
[SPEAKER_00]: there by word of mouth, but Once we got
into the industry and I started,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know meeting the people and
understanding what was going on I was like
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is absolutely the industry for us
because yeah We wanted to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to Take what we knew how to do
and help people and I think in this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, you know We can add a lot of
good insight and tools to really help
[SPEAKER_00]: people out And that so that was kind of
how we ended up here And my husband's
[SPEAKER_00]: overjoyed because we've had a tent in our
basement for like a decade and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: always Yeah, this has always been his
favorite hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he's like now it's my career.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Well, that's gotta be awesome for him
for sure He's always down there taking
[SPEAKER_00]: notes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and I mean, you know, there's I mean
this hot blatant is just one aspect of it
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do think it's interesting that you
know You look at other crops and you get
[SPEAKER_04]: to stand on decades of research There's a
lot of information that's out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of resources for people and
then all of a sudden you have this thing
[SPEAKER_04]: that's trying to make legal and it's a
multi-billion dollar crop and nobody knows
[SPEAKER_04]: anything about it other than like In
terms, I don't mean anything I just mean
[SPEAKER_04]: in the sense that like the type of money
and energy that gets brought to bear on
[SPEAKER_04]: other agricultural crops Yeah,
we're like in the infancy of hemp and
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis being looked at at all in that
fashion Yeah, yeah all the other crops
[SPEAKER_00]: have had decades of research federal
funding You know lots of grants and money
[SPEAKER_00]: and academic institutions supporting them
and you know cannabis doesn't really get
[SPEAKER_00]: to benefit from much of that so We have a
lot of work to do a lot of research to do
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think sadly too I think the onset of
legalization is really what And even like
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe medical in the 215 era is really
what created the problem And what I mean
[SPEAKER_04]: by that is that in the original era that I
was in like I said You either made your
[SPEAKER_04]: own clones or started your own seeds or
got them from a close associate and it was
[SPEAKER_04]: very small circles Once you started being
able in the 215 era in the medical era
[SPEAKER_04]: with a medical card to go into
dispensaries or Go to nurseries and buy
[SPEAKER_04]: your clones Right and now especially in
the legal market like in California in
[SPEAKER_04]: California But in other places too where
they've mandated that you sort of have to
[SPEAKER_04]: get you have to have a nursery license to
even provide plant matter to Most farms
[SPEAKER_04]: they sort of centralized that aspect which
meant that when some of these diseases got
[SPEAKER_04]: into some of those centralized nurseries
Yeah, it went everywhere like really
[SPEAKER_04]: quickly, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: and so and then you know, one of the
things we don't know is For instance like
[SPEAKER_04]: how long can it persist on surfaces?
[SPEAKER_04]: How long can it persist in soil?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know all these different types of
things because what's happening to people
[SPEAKER_04]: is that they're getting they're getting
clones from a nursery and They're to me up
[SPEAKER_04]: to my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no regulation or penalties for a
nursery selling you diseased or infected
[SPEAKER_04]: products Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that's another thing that Canada's
interested industry, you know I suffers
[SPEAKER_00]: from is that a lot of these other
industries these these pathogens are
[SPEAKER_00]: highly regulated and they're you know,
there's government mandates of what to be
[SPEAKER_00]: tested and how to be tested and how to
decide if the testing lab is is good
[SPEAKER_00]: enough or it's done enough validation,
but Yeah, there's no requirements right
[SPEAKER_00]: now in cannabis which which means that you
know Lots of stuff's going on that that's
[SPEAKER_04]: lots of stuff's going on and that I think
I don't think with regulation they
[SPEAKER_04]: intended for that to happen, but it was
simply like an outgrowth of forcing
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone to go to a few nurseries and Then
this gets into a few nurseries and they're
[SPEAKER_04]: cloning for everyone and they're not
changing their equipment They're not
[SPEAKER_04]: taking precautions and so it spreads from
maybe one or two varietals through their
[SPEAKER_04]: whole thing and then everyone is getting
infected plants yeah, and You know and so
[SPEAKER_04]: there's definitely been already legal
farms that have failed Because being
[SPEAKER_04]: infected and reduced yield reduced quality
you know that type of thing so I guess
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe we should go on to like maybe the
first thing that we should we should we
[SPEAKER_04]: could discuss is like Because there's a
lot I was I was thinking of but like
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the best way like let's say that
you have a plant in your garden that has
[SPEAKER_04]: it like a mom plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the best way to keep it from
spreading?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you might not know that you have
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you might as well act like you do
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean that one thing I was gonna
say is that you know kind of above or
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout all of the recommendations to
keep it from spreading the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that people can do is to acknowledge
that this is everywhere and nobody is
[SPEAKER_00]: immune from it and It's not you know a
them problem You know, it's it's it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: ubiquitous issue and in order for it to be
addressed the first thing you have to do I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess I don't want to sound like an
addiction counselor or whatever or but is
[SPEAKER_00]: to admit That there's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah All of us need to be taking
precautions, you know from home grower all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way up to multi-state operator MSO To
make sure that we're not spreading it
[SPEAKER_00]: through the industry, you know passing it
on to other people that kind of thing So
[SPEAKER_00]: the most important precautions to keep it
from spreading would be Sterilization so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to be sterilizing your tools
and There's a lot of information out there
[SPEAKER_00]: flying around about what works and what
doesn't and I've even heard a scientist
[SPEAKER_00]: contradicting each other which I'm sure is
super frustrating for everybody out there
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hear one thing in one podcast and
another thing in another so I actually
[SPEAKER_00]: went through all of the literature and
Consolidated into one document which you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys can find on our website if you want
to and they basically tried 53 different
[SPEAKER_00]: things In the literature with scientific
experiments and there were only five of
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemicals or treatments that worked
and there was only one would they were
[SPEAKER_00]: able to show worked on multiple viruses or
fibroids in multiple crop species and that
[SPEAKER_00]: was bleach Ten to twenty percent bleach 60
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I say that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm saying it again use bleach So
you want to sterilize your tools as you
[SPEAKER_00]: move from plant to plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a couple Pairs of you know
scissors or razor blades or whatever all
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting in the bleach and just pull a
clean one out Do your cuts put it back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bleach and grab a different one for
the next plant if you get sap or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: on your hands You are going to be want to
be wearing gloves and you can get put some
[SPEAKER_00]: bleach in a spray bottle Splay your hands
and rub it around just like you put on
[SPEAKER_00]: hand sanitizer or something like that and
you said 60 seconds 60 seconds for the
[SPEAKER_00]: tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and this include your hands like if
you had gloves on And you're rubbing it
[SPEAKER_04]: does that mean like similar to kovat if
you if you wash your hands that long It's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to kill it Yeah, so so
basically if you spray it on your gloves
[SPEAKER_00]: and rub it around and just leave it there
It's gonna end up sitting there for 60
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds anyway, so you don't have to rinse
it off your hands you can just let it dry
[SPEAKER_00]: on there and That's exactly how we do it
in the lab to be honest too because you
[SPEAKER_00]: know contamination there is also an issue
so You know if you get plant matter on a
[SPEAKER_00]: table Or whatever just sterilize it clean
it up really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use some bleach there,
too Don't let debris and whatnot sit
[SPEAKER_00]: around on the floor on the tables So make
sure to be sterilizing all those surfaces
[SPEAKER_04]: because let me throw it Let me throw in
another question that might be slightly
[SPEAKER_04]: technical or whatever But does it matter
what kind of bleach?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I have I have heard that for
instance say that like sodium like normal
[SPEAKER_04]: household bleach for your clothing or
whatever sodium You know is is a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit more unstable, and if it gets a little
bit dirty it can get inert fairly fast
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard that like pool bleach is
stronger and more effective, and it's more
[SPEAKER_04]: stable right so There's different types of
bleach I guess you go to the store and you
[SPEAKER_04]: could get you know splashless bleach
versus cheap bleach versus pool bleach You
[SPEAKER_04]: know some of them are calcium chloride
some of them are so I just wondered if
[SPEAKER_04]: there was a difference there Or you had a
preference like in your lab What would you
[SPEAKER_04]: use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so in our lab we use good old sodium
hypochlorite, which is your regular
[SPEAKER_00]: household bleach The the critical point
here is not the kind of bleach or the
[SPEAKER_00]: splash lists or whatever it's the the
concentration of the active ingredient so
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that the believe the
final concentration of the bleach the
[SPEAKER_00]: active ingredient is above point zero or
point five percent so that means if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: Making a one to ten or a ten percent
solution the household bleach needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: have at least five percent of the active
ingredient And most of them do in fact I
[SPEAKER_00]: think the lowest one that I know of is
five point two five percent So okay in a
[SPEAKER_00]: one to ten solution or a one to nine which
would make a ten percent solution should
[SPEAKER_04]: be the right concentration Because I see a
lot of people out there going and using
[SPEAKER_04]: pool bleach or different forms of bleach
because they thought that The household
[SPEAKER_04]: bleach was inferior and wasn't as strong
or didn't work as well And it was risky to
[SPEAKER_04]: only use that and so I just thought like
some clear direction on It seems like it
[SPEAKER_04]: seems like you know cheap available
household bleach will be fine Yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and almost all of the studies in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all of the studies have used
sodium hypochlorite so You do want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it up fresh every day because you are
correct it does lose effectiveness
[SPEAKER_00]: especially If it sits at a dilute solution
if it gets really saturated with plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material it'll also start to lose
effectiveness So you're just gonna want to
[SPEAKER_00]: you know dump it out of whatever your
little jar is and fill it up with some
[SPEAKER_00]: more ten percent bleach You can also make
it up at that twenty percent concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: which would be four parts water one part
bleach And then it'll last a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: longer Just to make people feel more
comfortable they actually did do a study
[SPEAKER_00]: where they asked how Long it was effective
for and they made a dilute solution of
[SPEAKER_00]: twenty percent bleach and it was still
inhibiting transmission up to thirty days
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not saturated with plant
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just kind of hanging around now I
don't so you could make a spray bottle for
[SPEAKER_04]: instance of twenty percent and And it
would be and it would be staying you know
[SPEAKER_04]: contained it wouldn't be getting
contaminated by plant material and you
[SPEAKER_04]: could use that to Spray your gloves or
whatever for quite some time is what
[SPEAKER_04]: you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah now I I would definitely Recommend
making it up fresh, but if you know there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a miscommunication or you weren't sure
when it was made there is some flexibility
[SPEAKER_00]: there Bleach is cheap bleach is cheap and
it's very effective because I remember I
[SPEAKER_04]: first saw that interview with you where I
was that I was that we were I was at a
[SPEAKER_04]: good friend's nursery and Like I said,
they were all heat sterilizing their tools
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and then I just watched you and you
were like, oh that doesn't work and I was
[SPEAKER_04]: like, oh no Because they're out there
trying to do best practices and do what
[SPEAKER_04]: they can To make sure it doesn't work and
then all of a sudden they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's ineffective Yeah,
yeah, so that that was actually tried in
[SPEAKER_00]: the literature six seconds in a propane
blowtorch And it reached an average
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of four hundred and thirty
degrees Fahrenheit And it did not stop the
[SPEAKER_00]: transmission So I mean now this I should I
should qualify all of this Almost in fact
[SPEAKER_00]: none of these experiments were done with
hop latent thyroid all the virus have a
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar structure and metabolism in
the cell so We're extrapolating
[SPEAKER_00]: information from other viroids because a
lot of research has been done in other
[SPEAKER_04]: plants that makes sense I was there was
one of my other questions is how because
[SPEAKER_04]: there's not there's not a lot of money yet
Coming into this type of stuff like how
[SPEAKER_04]: much specific research is even going into
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that's not much right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to bridge that gap We
actually started a collaboration with
[SPEAKER_00]: Texas A&M And we are we're starting
research into some of the really basic
[SPEAKER_00]: questions seed transmission You know
levels around the plant that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to encourage more academic
cooperation and and more research so maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: we could ask a series of Questions and you
could say I know I don't know and or
[SPEAKER_04]: explain so obviously it seems like
sterilizing tools is very Important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like if you're taking cuttings,
that would be a primary method of
[SPEAKER_04]: transmission right is what about What
about runoff from watering plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so what I'm gonna tell you is what's
been demonstrated in the literature so For
[SPEAKER_00]: a viroid called potato spindle tuber
viroid, which is in the same family as
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplite and viroid with a very similar
structure They showed that the viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't high Level in the roots and that's
the same in hops plants for hoplite and
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid the viroid leaks from the roots
into the water and if they watered tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with viroid containing water those
plants Became infected with the viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also showed in that paper that the
viroid remained infectious for up to seven
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks so in the water so That research
wasn't done in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't done With hoplite and viroid,
but I think there is enough demonstrated
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence in the literature for it to be a
concern.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay So that I was gonna ask how
long can it persist you're saying that can
[SPEAKER_04]: persist up to I mean like seven weeks is a
long time Seven weeks is a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes on surfaces They've done these
experiments and they've tested it out to
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours and shown that it does survive
for 24 hours on most common surfaces
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, they did Go beyond 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be longer, but It can persist
for that long What about For instance
[SPEAKER_04]: insect vectors things like thrips mites
root aphids, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: I know obviously we can catch malaria from
a mosquito We can get Lyme disease and
[SPEAKER_04]: other stuff from ticks.
[SPEAKER_04]: How worried are you about bugs spreading
it from one plant to another?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so I would not be at all surprised if
that was a method of transmission As far
[SPEAKER_00]: as I am aware There was only one study in
the literature done with hoplite and
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid on bug transmission and it was done
with aphids In hops plants and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: unable to show vector insect vector
transmission with aphids Now that does not
[SPEAKER_00]: mean that aphids wouldn't spread it in
cannabis It doesn't mean that other types
[SPEAKER_00]: of insects wouldn't spread it and a lot of
bugs Viroids are spread by insects the
[SPEAKER_00]: research just isn't there yet to One way
or the other as to whether or not it can
[SPEAKER_00]: be spread by insects for hoplite viroid in
cannabis because to me especially like as
[SPEAKER_04]: a You know as somebody who uses the Sun
quite often I was I was talking about it
[SPEAKER_04]: with some other farmers and You know We
can you can do all these best practices
[SPEAKER_04]: and you can do all these things yourself
and be very self-contained and have your
[SPEAKER_04]: mother room be Perfect and then you know
some thrips blow over from the neighbor's
[SPEAKER_04]: garden and you're and you're in trouble
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and I mean I should say when we're
talking about hoplite and viroid right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, but there are viruses in cannabis Out
that affect outdoor more and those are
[SPEAKER_00]: spread by insects.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Like beat curly top coming from leaf
hoppers and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So you definitely want to be
concerned about insects because they are a
[SPEAKER_00]: big vector for a lot of different people
pathogens The seed the seed one's probably
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna be the one that we're gonna hear the
most and leading up to this interview for
[SPEAKER_03]: Like since I announced it I have heard so
many answers on so many people so
[SPEAKER_03]: confident on the exact percentage of
transmissibility in cannabis seeds for
[SPEAKER_04]: sure Yeah, what and wildly different
percentages that they think are proven as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so very low some quite much higher So
it's you know, we what are your what is
[SPEAKER_04]: studies that you're seeing show as far as
seed transmission?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so there is one study in hops showing
that seed transmission of hoplite and
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid in hop plants is 8% We have started
preliminary studies, so this is very
[SPEAKER_00]: preliminary and We still are working with
Texas A&M because they're they're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: out the plants but what we are finding Is
that it's variable based on the cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: based on how infected the mom was and so
My gut is that these people are claiming
[SPEAKER_00]: wildly different numbers because it's
going to be wildly different For each
[SPEAKER_00]: batch of seeds each cultivar and you know
Obviously if your plant is on fire with
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplite and viroid that that percent
transmission might be higher than a low
[SPEAKER_00]: level infection Maybe you see nothing or
zero percent transmission.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Pretty par for the course with cannabis
like anybody who tries any serious
[SPEAKER_03]: scientific studies into cannabis sexual
expression by ethylene production or
[SPEAKER_03]: Inhibition they find that it's just so
variable in every single it's not down to
[SPEAKER_03]: strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's down to Not just the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's down to the plant in that specific
environment And it's just there's so much
[SPEAKER_03]: variability to even be taking stabs at
numbers like that until there's like this
[SPEAKER_03]: wide-ranging Study that just hasn't been
allowed to be done yet So seed
[SPEAKER_04]: transmission you would probably it's fair
to say is just it's Variable or requires a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot more study before we know it's sort of
an educated guess at best at this point
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I would say there's probably enough
evidence to say seed transmission happens
[SPEAKER_00]: or can happen But there is not enough
studies out there and and high enough
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers to come up with a percentage And
that's gonna take a lot of research,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and certainly not In cannabis
specifically right like the studies were
[SPEAKER_03]: done in hops So can this is a completely
different beast even though they're very
[SPEAKER_04]: similar in structure I was almost you know
I'm by no means a scientist But when I was
[SPEAKER_04]: reading about the the viroids trying to
like prepare for talking about tonight it
[SPEAKER_04]: almost made me think of like some of these
viroids have some similarities with
[SPEAKER_04]: enzymes and Then like they're not actually
alive They're sort of like waiting for a
[SPEAKER_04]: reaction to happen like to encounter
something that then triggers what they can
[SPEAKER_04]: do They you know one of one of the aspects
that you know So like it, you know can if
[SPEAKER_04]: it persists then it can just be sitting
there in a seed or it can be it can be You
[SPEAKER_04]: know, do you think people can transmit it
by touching?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Potentially the way that the viroids so
the viroid needs to gain access via a
[SPEAKER_00]: breakpoint so if for example You're
trimming your plants and you have goo on
[SPEAKER_00]: your hands and then you touch another
plant and you even if there's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: micro tear or you know Just a little
breakage of a stem as you're touching you
[SPEAKER_00]: can spread it like that but there needs to
be like some sap exchange between a sick
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and a Healthy plant that has a
little opening for this for the sick for
[SPEAKER_04]: the infected sap to get in So for lack of
a better way to look at it like healthy
[SPEAKER_04]: skin would prevent You would have to have
a cut or abrasion or something like that
[SPEAKER_04]: in order to give a vector for it to go in
Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there has to be some type of even
miniature mechanical damage for it to
[SPEAKER_04]: access the plant Okay So I guess do you
know anything about because this is the
[SPEAKER_04]: other part of it that is Really harmful is
obviously like cannabis is under a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: financial pressure right now Legalization
has not been smooth There's a lot of odd
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations going on and people are really
feeling it And you know, one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: biggest aspects of hop latent Is the
expense of trying to figure out how to
[SPEAKER_04]: deal with it once you have it,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes and you know, there's there's You know
one of the one of the groups that spread
[SPEAKER_04]: it a bunch one of the nurseries then later
came out with a cure Right of you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen a lot of stuff about tissue
culture Marist em Heat treatments various
[SPEAKER_04]: to be honest very expensive and
time-consuming treatments That you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: some people have been jumping on because
they have a favorite cultivar.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a favorite strain They don't
know where they can get it again and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: infected and so there's a big push to like
I want to save this thing Rather than just
[SPEAKER_04]: throw it away and give up, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I see a lot of conflicting
information on whether or not this stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: actually works Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so Tissue culture can work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a hundred percent effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to work the same on every
cultivar So here we go again, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna depend on how infected the plant is
When people are doing this heat treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, so it was shown in hops that if you
subject the plant to high heat Like 35
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is the temperature they use The
level of the viroid will decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't go away completely But it goes
down enough that when they dissect the
[SPEAKER_00]: apical Mary stem They they have a higher
chance of not getting any infected
[SPEAKER_00]: material along with the apical Mary stem
So you can clean it with tissue culture it
[SPEAKER_00]: is a lengthy process and it takes a long
time and not everyone works so if you
[SPEAKER_00]: think I mean what they do is they Clean it
then they you know, they they they grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch up and they have to test each of
them Get rid of the ones where it didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: work and just keep on testing I mean that
they usually are testing for a really long
[SPEAKER_00]: time before they can be sure that they've
cleaned it completely And that's because
[SPEAKER_03]: the the apical Mary stems not in the
vascular system Is that why the by right
[SPEAKER_03]: isn't there and that's what they try to
keep it like that little bit from any kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of contamination on the sides and Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it is excluded From that region
that the the like the stem cells in there
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do you have to be super careful
and know exactly what you're doing to get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of all that vascular tissue because
that tissue does have Hoplite environment
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll maybe that leads to another
question then Because I've seen people who
[SPEAKER_04]: have had inconclusive testing You know
when it comes to testing for Hoplite which
[SPEAKER_04]: is obviously extremely frustrating because
you want to get a negative test Then you
[SPEAKER_04]: want to be like, okay, I'm in the clear,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: My plan is clean But what what it seems
like is that almost like with kovat or
[SPEAKER_04]: something else if you're heavily infected
It's almost always a yes that it'll pick
[SPEAKER_04]: it up But maybe if you're only lightly
infected it could come back negative,
[SPEAKER_04]: right and you might so how many What maybe
walk us through like if somebody was
[SPEAKER_04]: worried that their plant wasn't performing
the right way or looked a little sickly
[SPEAKER_04]: How many tests how far apart what Protocol
should they have to like ascertain whether
[SPEAKER_04]: or not they're infected or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, okay, so So first to understand why
you there's such a frustration with you
[SPEAKER_00]: know Getting a negative test and the
positive test or part of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: positive and part of its negative Is
understanding how viroids actually move
[SPEAKER_00]: through the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a plant gets infected the viroid
moves through the tissue until it reaches
[SPEAKER_00]: the vascular system once it's in the
Vascular system, it basically has to hitch
[SPEAKER_00]: a ride on the movement of the sap of the
plant So where it's going to go is
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent on where the sap from that
branch is currently traveling So viroids
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to move for what they call a
source to sink type movement So they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to move towards areas of the plant
that are experiencing active growth at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time the plant was infected So you can
imagine if it's a middle branch and it
[SPEAKER_00]: travels to the vascular system It's going
to move up towards the new growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: but those lower branches are less likely
to receive fibroid So not every part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant is going to get the same load at
the same time So the reason that they say
[SPEAKER_00]: oh submit multiple samples is we don't you
don't since you don't know when the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: was inoculated and what the source to sink
You know flow was at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to grab a bunch of different
spots of the plant To feel confident that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've you've cased Enough areas that the
statistical probability of catching it is
[SPEAKER_00]: high enough I will say we did run a little
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quite ready for Publication yet
or or putting on our website But Capricorn
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery was gracious enough to take in a
couple positive for four positive plants
[SPEAKER_00]: actually and they took Samples for us all
over the plant, you know new growth old
[SPEAKER_00]: growth stems roots everything And the part
of the plant that was the most predictive
[SPEAKER_00]: of infection was the roots We got a
hundred percent success rate when we
[SPEAKER_00]: tested the roots And if you think about it
This makes a lot of sense because the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots are always growing and you're always
gonna have nutrients from the foliage
[SPEAKER_00]: moving into the roots So it I would say if
you were gonna pick a part of the plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: pick some root tissue as well as Some
petiole tissue around the plant just
[SPEAKER_00]: because this was a preliminary study It
was four plants and I don't want to base
[SPEAKER_00]: someone's diagnostic on you know a small
study like that But I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: suggestive enough to also be submitting
root tissue one of the one of the ways We
[SPEAKER_04]: had a good friend of ours who experienced
at the time what we called dudding which
[SPEAKER_04]: you know I'm a collector of old and rare
and unpopular things and so for people
[SPEAKER_04]: like us It's really scary, you know
because in cannabis there's not very many
[SPEAKER_04]: people That are willing to hold on to a
wide diversity of genetics Especially if
[SPEAKER_04]: they're not currently profitable,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah And so to have something like this
rip through your collection of possibly
[SPEAKER_04]: old unpopular not backed up by very many
people sometimes not backed up by anyone
[SPEAKER_04]: Is pretty scary and one of the things that
he learned or he guessed was that it was
[SPEAKER_04]: his runoff on Sharing on trays and things
like that was that it was infecting things
[SPEAKER_04]: and so he instituted a program where like
Every single mom was elevated and drained
[SPEAKER_04]: away so that no runoff would ever touch
another plant Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I think that's that's a good
idea and it's not just for hoplite and
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid there's a lot of root fungal
pathogens that spread through the water
[SPEAKER_00]: and Shared water if you're trying to
prevent pathogens Is not recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's it's an excellent way for a
bunch of pathogens to move around I can
[SPEAKER_04]: tell you That before we ever heard the
term hop latent A lot of us were
[SPEAKER_04]: considering gutting to be an aggressive
form of fusarium Yeah, you know and and we
[SPEAKER_04]: were you know, there was a lot of there
was a lot of like, you know Our research
[SPEAKER_04]: going into like well, how do you cure
that?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you get rid of that because we
couldn't do the testing?
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were just observationally seeing what
was going on and So basically I guess What
[SPEAKER_04]: you're saying is you think is it fair to
say that you think that the vast majority
[SPEAKER_04]: of?
[SPEAKER_04]: Transmission is happening via runoff and
via cloning with contaminated tools So I
[SPEAKER_00]: would say the vast majority is happening
via mechanical transmission with tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Suspect that there is a percentage of
transmission going along with water
[SPEAKER_00]: transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I don't have published evidence
to show that we did we did take some
[SPEAKER_00]: tubing from a water emitter from a
facility that had an outbreak and we just
[SPEAKER_00]: used the tube itself in the PCR and we
were able to amplify hoplite and by right
[SPEAKER_00]: from the tube so It was in there and it
was stuck to the rubber on the inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the tube whether or not It was sufficient
to infect a plant, you know, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: But it lived there It was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I answer the question how many times
to test your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes Certain that it's negative you need to
test it at least at least twice Three to
[SPEAKER_00]: four weeks apart so that if it was missed
because it was a very early infection you
[SPEAKER_00]: give that plant long enough to have enough
of a systemic infection and a high enough
[SPEAKER_00]: load that you can you can catch it the
second time around and Honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would I think people if you know there
you're really trying to be careful I would
[SPEAKER_00]: test your mother plants periodically,
you know On a continual basis on a routine
[SPEAKER_00]: basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everyone has the ability to do this
Yeah, and it's difficult but we in in
[SPEAKER_04]: recent years with the influx of just a
bunch of horrific things That started
[SPEAKER_04]: getting spread around not just hoplite and
but root aphids You know, we call them
[SPEAKER_04]: super mites Which are basically two
spotted mites that have been trained for
[SPEAKER_04]: decades to grow resistant to many
pesticides every every Just like any other
[SPEAKER_04]: thing overuse of certain kind like,
you know, like overuse of antibiotics or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever and all sudden you have so,
you know, there's Basically, I guess what
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying with that is that you know You
would recommend let's say that you bring
[SPEAKER_04]: in something new or old that you're
excited about and you quarantine it You
[SPEAKER_04]: would recommend at least two tests Four
weeks apart and get both of those things
[SPEAKER_04]: Negative before you would feel confident
to even want to move that plant into your
[SPEAKER_04]: larger safer mother room of hopefully
clean genetics Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think strict quarantine for anything new
two tests For economically critical
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens and I would probably add
fusarium oxysporum to that list Because
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want that floating around your
grow either Separate tools you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be using the same tools and if you're
thinking about the Workflow in your
[SPEAKER_00]: facility obviously don't start in the
quarantine room and then move to your mom
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure So this is yeah, and this is exactly
what the US government does right when
[SPEAKER_00]: when plants come in they go in strict
quarantine And they're tested and observed
[SPEAKER_00]: before they're allowed into the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Another another aspect of that that I
I find interesting and I'd love some
[SPEAKER_04]: clarification on is that You know when
people are doing clones right and
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously especially like in commercial
instances where you're taking Hundreds or
[SPEAKER_04]: even thousands of clones on a work shift,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do stuff like you can do what we
talked about earlier where you could have
[SPEAKER_04]: bleach and you could have rotating tools
and you can clean all that and You can
[SPEAKER_04]: have you know fresh starting material
whether it's rock wool or plugs or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever but One of the things that I know
about cannabis that everyone does is most
[SPEAKER_04]: of the time every single stem goes in that
rooting gel or goes in that dip and grow
[SPEAKER_04]: or goes in that hormone right and Trying
to figure out how to isolate Hormone or
[SPEAKER_04]: rooting gel or whatever for each specific
plant themselves and not mixing that that
[SPEAKER_04]: is a bottleneck and so You know expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, how risky is it to dip?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say you dip a clone into dip and
grow for three hours Or four seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much and but it's a fresh wound Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you just cut how much risk is that
and how and what what practices could
[SPEAKER_04]: people even institute?
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to not make that a vector for
transmission Yeah, so If you cut a clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and and you have this huge open
wound it's and it's it's infected It's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be seeping hoplite and fibroid into
that solution and If you get a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: that's infected and you dip another one in
that solution You're you've basically
[SPEAKER_00]: created an inoculum and you're using it to
inoculate every clone after that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: dipped into that solution That's dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean just to be honest,
you know, I get it's the reality of it but
[SPEAKER_04]: it just yeah, it just leads to a whole
series of it's basically like you want to
[SPEAKER_04]: have a different vessel for For cloning
material for every single plant Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, and I mean, I don't know if you
know, maybe an egg carton, you know So you
[SPEAKER_00]: just have a little bit in each each spot
or something something I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to break in but like it even goes
down to like even different parts of the
[SPEAKER_03]: goddamn plant if it's a big enough plant
because some of that might have more viral
[SPEAKER_03]: load than the bottom half and you may
actually increase your chance of
[SPEAKER_03]: Inoculating it when you might otherwise
not have and got grabbed a clean branch
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere left I mean I was almost
thinking of like I mean you could have
[SPEAKER_04]: permanent you could have like,
you know 20 different glass shot glasses
[SPEAKER_04]: that you have a little bit of different
grow or a little bit of your hormone or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever in each one and then as soon as
you're done with it you dump the excess
[SPEAKER_04]: out into something and you drop it into
bleach and you move on to the next one and
[SPEAKER_04]: then by the time but something like that
would have to be because you could
[SPEAKER_04]: sterilize it and Just wait a minute or two
Right and it would be clean Yes,
[SPEAKER_04]: so if you had say 10 shot glasses you
could go from plant to plant and not
[SPEAKER_04]: spread it because I will tell you that 99%
of people out there that are taking
[SPEAKER_04]: precautions are still using a Centralized
dipping solution of some kind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's just the industry standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how it how it works Yeah,
that would that's definitely if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned at all that any of your plants
have happened Then you're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be sharing anything that has
touched sap and then dip another plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: it with a gaping wound Because you're just
gonna spread it That makes that makes
[SPEAKER_04]: excellent sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a question So you see a lot of
plants probably that come in that are
[SPEAKER_03]: negative for obsolete and vibrate But
people suspect them of being dutted now
[SPEAKER_03]: when you see this negative thing Pop up
for the hops late and what I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: do you test it for what else it could be
and at that point?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the next most common form of
things that people are calling dutted that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're seeing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so beyond hoplite and viroid the
Percentage of plants that have other
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses, you know, at least that we know
of is pretty low It's usually hoplite and
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid if they're seeing viral like
symptoms other things can cause stunted
[SPEAKER_00]: growth like Fusarium Pythium, right
because these things are chewing on roots
[SPEAKER_00]: and so you're gonna see slow growth or
it'll look like a nutrient deficiency kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of yeah, so we're definitely seeing those
pathogens also and Just a little sidebar
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also seeing that those pathogens can
come in through people's water sources
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you're not changing like,
you know following all the recommendations
[SPEAKER_00]: for example Or how your water is filtered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I would highly recommend that
people test their water systems
[SPEAKER_00]: periodically Just to make sure that they
don't have anything growing in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're you know, watering their plants
with like Pythium water So yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: that is I mean, that's something I haven't
done this in a long time, but 20 years ago
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a mostly hydroponic person and when
you're growing with water culture and like
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrient film technique and stuff you
learn About Pythium you learn about water
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature how it can grow how it can
replicate So if let's say you had a 50
[SPEAKER_04]: gallon drum for the sake of argument,
right and you were worried about your
[SPEAKER_04]: water What would be what would be the way
that you would think would be the best way
[SPEAKER_04]: to sterilize it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then how long would you have to wait
before you could use it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you add a certain amount of bleach
stir it for ten minutes an hour or two
[SPEAKER_04]: hours and then go or do you have data on
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not gonna say for sure because I'm
not exactly sure at what concentration I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: comfortable with that No, I get it there's
I figured there was gonna be you have you
[SPEAKER_04]: have certainty you have uncertainty and
you have I don't know which is That's
[SPEAKER_04]: where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I I'm not sure how how effective it
could be to actually sterilize the water
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in that tank I can say if you want
to test it You should take the stuff from
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom the the stuff where all the
material might settle and grab whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: that sludge is And we can usually find it
if it's there because we for the water
[SPEAKER_00]: testing we grow it out on plates So it's
not like a 24-hour thing like testing for
[SPEAKER_00]: the viroid But then we can grow it up and
look at all the fuzzy stuff that grows and
[SPEAKER_00]: do a PCR test on each colony To see if you
got something growing in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so another thing that Maybe would be
really important For people is that
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously there's some growers that start
with fresh Material every time they grow
[SPEAKER_04]: whether that's rock wool or coconut fiber,
you know peat moss perlite, whatever But
[SPEAKER_04]: then there's also a growing movement of
people certainly outdoor but also moving
[SPEAKER_04]: more indoor, you know all kinds of living
soil or multi cycle grows that type of
[SPEAKER_04]: thing and so, you know, we did a I had a
commercial thing we were working on and We
[SPEAKER_04]: got some plants that did absolutely
horrible from a nursery And we tested the
[SPEAKER_04]: soil About three months after harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm, and it came up positive Yeah,
so for hot hoplite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I'm curious if you could tell
because there's a lot of people right now
[SPEAKER_04]: that want to move to more like
regenerative practices that want to be
[SPEAKER_04]: reusing their medium either from an
expense per, you know perspective or maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: like a you know, what just Whatever it
might be right and there's a lot that are
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to reuse their soil reuse their mix
do multiple cycles in it So, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: basically what it's really scary for
people like them is that if they get
[SPEAKER_04]: infected It's a lot more expensive for
them to just throw it out and start over
[SPEAKER_04]: Than it is for someone that just buys six
inch rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well every crime every time right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do you recommend?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I obviously sterilizing soil as
its whole thing Do you have any data or
[SPEAKER_04]: anything like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: On how long it can persist in soil if you
plant inflict infected plants after you've
[SPEAKER_00]: killed them Yeah, so Once again,
these experiments have not been done in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in hops they can show that the
viroid overwinters But that's a perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not it's not a very good You know
comparison because it has living roots and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff that it can stain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I will say It's even in in cannabis
from you know, the limited studies that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in very high concentration in the
roots So if you have an infected plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's still root material left in that
soil If you plant another plant in that
[SPEAKER_00]: root material, I I think you're playing
with fire as far as getting infected
[SPEAKER_04]: plants That's everyone that reuses their
soil because they typically cut the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: down and they're really relying on biology
and various things to break down the root
[SPEAKER_04]: mass in the system and return that energy
or whatever to the soil food web So no one
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean it would be impossible even unless
you like micro screen to remove roots
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you know you you if you I mean,
I don't know what's cheaper testing every
[SPEAKER_00]: plant or you know the some root decay left
in the pot or just starting with new soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it would definitely not be Reusing
soil from a plant that had hoplite and
[SPEAKER_04]: phyroid So basically what you're saying is
anyone that uses the same soil year after
[SPEAKER_04]: year in an outdoor situation or in a
greenhouse Or anyone that is in some sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of living soil organic regenerative thing
where they're doing multiple cycles They
[SPEAKER_04]: would need to be even more militant than
normal Yeah I mean I think kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: this comes down to is that you know all of
these practices can be worked into a
[SPEAKER_00]: regular standard operating procedure as
long as you're testing as long as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly measuring, you know the the
biotic stress of your plants and so You
[SPEAKER_00]: know what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: You you're you know, you can adopt your
SOPs depending on what outbreaks or which
[SPEAKER_00]: types of pathogens are There but if you're
not collecting information, then you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: make intelligent choices downstream about
what's safe and what isn't so If we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get it under control people need to
be Monitoring their plants all of the time
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that they don't have
something, you know spreading in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: and because if you don't then you end up
with catastrophic glass losses or Possibly
[SPEAKER_04]: you do so on that level That leads me to
another question and it's related to
[SPEAKER_04]: something Matt said, you know You said
earlier too that like in addition to
[SPEAKER_04]: hoplite and you would also test for a
certain kind of fusarium You know Matt was
[SPEAKER_04]: talking earlier about You know other forms
of dudding to use the common term You know
[SPEAKER_04]: I So for you since you offer these
services or something like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: how how affordable is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if we were to create a panel of
hoplite and with two or three other common
[SPEAKER_04]: things, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: How much does it how much is it gonna
honestly cost somebody just like even just
[SPEAKER_04]: like a hobbyist who's concerned and wants
to test their little collection to do like
[SPEAKER_00]: a Once a month on a plant for instance
Yes, so I mean obviously every testing lab
[SPEAKER_00]: is gonna have a different price and
whatever Our cost is $25 for a test for
[SPEAKER_04]: hoplite and specifically or for multiple
things So that's for hoplite and
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically we're working on channels
putting multiple things together and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you know kind of figuring out where the
cost of that will fall but Even if you
[SPEAKER_00]: know if you're a really large or a larger
facility and you want to get on some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of regular testing schedule Then there are
you know bulk deals and and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: subscription type things where we can help
with SOPs Sure, and then and then it gets
[SPEAKER_04]: more affordable there Because Matt not
Matt always he never You know people ask
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes what the size of my collection
is and he's always like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: don't but yeah You know in that regard for
a variety of reasons, but you can imagine
[SPEAKER_04]: let's say that someone does have a fairly
extensive collection Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and you want to regularly get them
tested That could that could be a major
[SPEAKER_04]: expense for a normal person, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to stay on top of things it could
run into the thousands of dollars a month
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps Yeah, I mean depending on your
collection, you know, if it's if it's big
[SPEAKER_04]: enough it can be an expense for sure So
then maybe maybe I could get like Perhaps
[SPEAKER_04]: a little like political regulatory So,
you know one of the one of the the the
[SPEAKER_04]: equitable things or people talk about like
social equity a lot in cannabis because a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of the people that are traditional or
legacy cannabis breeders Are you know sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of small outlawish type folks and now you
have a lot of big money You have a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: investment.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a lot of like people that never
would have dealt with it before So the
[SPEAKER_04]: culture is changing dramatically,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes Sadly, the little guy has a lot harder
time affording this than the big guy When
[SPEAKER_04]: in my opinion as far as I've been able to
determine it's unscrupulous or simply poor
[SPEAKER_04]: practice big people and that are spreading
it everywhere Right, and then they have no
[SPEAKER_04]: responsibility once it's gotten out there
to do anything about it They don't owe
[SPEAKER_04]: anyone anything, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you think then that there should be
some kind of Regulatory or political
[SPEAKER_04]: change where you know clones sold it
should come with a clean bill of health
[SPEAKER_04]: That that should be like an absolute
standard because to me if you're paying
[SPEAKER_04]: all this money for instance I'll just use
California as an example but if you're
[SPEAKER_04]: paying a bunch of money upfront for the
right to grow for your square footage and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're paying all these taxes and fees
upfront and you have all this cost and
[SPEAKER_04]: then you buy a thousand clones that ruin
your season and Now your soil is infected
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've got this massive issue The only
person that has no liability is the person
[SPEAKER_04]: that happily took your money To sell the
clones they're free and clear they you
[SPEAKER_04]: don't have I don't think there is any
cases of being able like in the regular
[SPEAKER_04]: agricultural system if You spread some
kind of terrible disease From your nursery
[SPEAKER_04]: to a big agricultural people.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll come after you, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I mean I think so this problem
Needs to be I mean, it's just my opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: attacked on multiple levels I think it
should be standard in the industry that
[SPEAKER_00]: you know If you're if you're selling
clones that you're getting your stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: tested and that you can provide some type
of documentation certification That you
[SPEAKER_00]: that it was tested and and these are the
results Like this mom was tested within 30
[SPEAKER_04]: days of me taking this quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and I think on the other end When
people are buying clones, they should have
[SPEAKER_00]: the right to say hey is this tested and if
the person says yeah I say awesome Can you
[SPEAKER_00]: give me the can you give me the results
and tell me what lab it was tested
[SPEAKER_00]: through?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do your own research and decide
whether or not you believe the results you
[SPEAKER_00]: trust the science you know, you can you
can get clones and Just do a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: screening yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you bought a thousand clones,
you can you can bulk test You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe five or six clones per tube and just
Try to get like even even like five
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of them and send them in well your
own I'll throw something out there because
[SPEAKER_04]: this is this is maybe a little technical
So I'm not gonna try to bore anyone but
[SPEAKER_04]: with the rate with you know, honestly with
the regulations exist or whatever in legal
[SPEAKER_04]: situations Like a lot of a lot of you know
licenses that have flowering rights You
[SPEAKER_04]: know, you're supposed to move your plants
into those areas within 24 hours You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't have like it's not that easy To
like just sit there take a bunch of clones
[SPEAKER_04]: spend a few weeks testing them waiting for
results making sure they're clean Keeping
[SPEAKER_04]: them healthy without transplanting them
and then figuring out whether or not you
[SPEAKER_04]: need to buy more clones Because a lot of
these nurseries you put your orders in in
[SPEAKER_04]: spring, you know You have a week that you
get your plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like if somebody screws you You
can go to another nursery and be like hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: I need 9,000 cuts and I'm behind they
might not even so I I guess What I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: saying is is I don't know that putting the
the responsibility on the farmer is Very
[SPEAKER_04]: effective for the farmer is in terms of
cost and just the way the regulations are
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost it almost seems to me like in I
mean, this is a crazy analogy or whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: but like, you know, you know people that
work in the sex industry like in movies
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff They have to get tested every
two or three weeks Right and they have to
[SPEAKER_04]: like before they go to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to provide a clean bill of
health So it almost seems to me like the
[SPEAKER_04]: same thing should be done with Nurseries
like if you want to sell thousands of
[SPEAKER_04]: clones to someone you should have a recent
test You know that shows that the mother
[SPEAKER_04]: that came off this stuff was not infected
because otherwise it's gonna keep
[SPEAKER_00]: happening Yes, I absolutely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean and I think We work with nurseries
that test all of the time I mean that test
[SPEAKER_00]: every you know They cut they and they send
in hundreds of samples to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not selling positive plants to
anybody And those are there's ethical
[SPEAKER_04]: people very much so shout out to our
friends at Radio Ridge Who I know spend a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of money monthly Testing their stuff,
but there's other unscrupulous nurseries
[SPEAKER_04]: that don't waste any money on that And
they end up spreading a lot of disease
[SPEAKER_00]: without realizing it Yeah, yeah,
and honestly, you know, I think that the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest responsibility that would fall to
the clone a person buying the clones is to
[SPEAKER_00]: simply ask did you test and you know,
you Have the right to move to a different
[SPEAKER_00]: person if you if that, you know If they
haven't been testing and you don't feel
[SPEAKER_00]: confident, you know, you can try to source
them from elsewhere, but I I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving forward that's gonna have to start
to become the industry standard if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna you know Get this thing under
control everybody's gonna have to be
[SPEAKER_04]: testing I can tell you having consulted
and worked at multiple legal scenes
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially ones that like are brand new
and getting off the ground Most of the
[SPEAKER_04]: bugs for talking of those we'll stop
talking about by roads for a second But
[SPEAKER_04]: most of the insects that come under those
under those first grows come from the
[SPEAKER_04]: nurseries They come with free root aphids
or free cannabis aphids or free thrips or
[SPEAKER_04]: you know free free You know two spotted
spider mites and there's no discount for
[SPEAKER_04]: that gift that comes along with that so
Nurseries haven't done a very good job yet
[SPEAKER_04]: of providing problem-free plants Yeah,
I kind of want to rewind it a bit because
[SPEAKER_03]: I did notice some people were mentioning
we didn't go over like initial reasons why
[SPEAKER_03]: someone would even Suspect they have hops
late and like me and not to have seen a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of plants with this So we know like
you see one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like, oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's it It's like it's obvious
But a lot of people watching are gonna be
[SPEAKER_03]: very confused on how they would even begin
to identify it So are there some some
[SPEAKER_03]: markers maybe you would tell us to look
out for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so common symptoms are gonna be slow
growth You'll have branches that instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of them coming up like the normal angle
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go out more horizontal like this
Yeah, more than 90 degree branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, correct, and they'll be brittle So,
you know if you if you like touch the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant like this, you know, they'll break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Another common thing it's a little
subtle but the leaves instead of kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: being separated will overlap a little bit
and that's another symptom You can also
[SPEAKER_00]: see things like leaf chlorosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Sometimes it'll like puff out and
look more like a Christmas tree Like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas tree type growth You know in in
little clones, you're gonna see much
[SPEAKER_00]: slower slower growth and sometimes it
looks kind of sparse and sickly but You
[SPEAKER_00]: know and then obviously Sometimes the
symptoms can be really subtle and
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on when it was infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not super easy to see it Until it
flowers and then it's just super duper
[SPEAKER_04]: disappointing Those are those are all I
would I wouldn't say all but I would say
[SPEAKER_04]: about 90% of what you mentioned Especially
the angle of the stem the brittleness of
[SPEAKER_04]: the stem and the small leaves are all
stuff that we had noticed Among plants
[SPEAKER_04]: that were worrisome Before we even knew
what the word how blatant was Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember one of the others was the stem
color There wasn't a lot of stem color.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, that's a really good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if you know about that
What we saw with infected plants is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Most infected plants would be like a
uniform pale green They wouldn't have any
[SPEAKER_04]: red or purple or any kind of coloration.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would almost be like a pure I don't
want to say sickly green because that's
[SPEAKER_03]: not right, but well their texture was
different, too It wasn't like the normal
[SPEAKER_03]: texture that I would see it was almost
rubbery And when you would move your hands
[SPEAKER_03]: down the stem, it would definitely break
because of its different type of texture
[SPEAKER_04]: It was basically be the the plant would
look almost a unit The stem would be a
[SPEAKER_04]: uniform pale green.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't have some of the variation
We've come to expect with you know as it
[SPEAKER_04]: gets woody or this or that and so,
yeah, you know one of But the other the
[SPEAKER_04]: other risk of that is that And maybe we
can jump into this for a minute is that
[SPEAKER_04]: the problem is is that you can be infected
and be asymptomatic Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you can have you can have an
infection that's young enough that it
[SPEAKER_04]: hasn't started showing these deformities
If you will, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so maybe you could explain You know,
and maybe you maybe you know Maybe you
[SPEAKER_04]: don't know but we you've mentioned a
number of times where there's differences
[SPEAKER_04]: between the viroid Just like exploding
around through the plant versus a plant
[SPEAKER_04]: that has less viroid What are some things
that can you know outside of just the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants health?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some things that slow or speed
the plant being infected in the sense of?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any idea on those aspects or
ways to slow it down even if it might be
[SPEAKER_04]: infected?
[SPEAKER_00]: that type of thing yeah, so so it is
mentioned in the literature that higher
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures and more intense light tends
to speed up the Replication of the viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: so it so the plants gonna have a higher
load You're gonna see the symptoms more
[SPEAKER_00]: robustly if the plant gets infected If the
plant gets stressed out, so that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean that it isn't it isn't in there
replicating but If the plant gets stressed
[SPEAKER_00]: out dried up or whatever The stress
response of the plant isn't going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning as well as a healthy plant And
so you're gonna see those symptoms come
[SPEAKER_00]: out really pronounced If the plant gets
stressed out You know, it's it's tough But
[SPEAKER_00]: what you what you really want to do is try
to find it before The symptoms are super
[SPEAKER_00]: obvious because once they're super obvious
the plant is you know Really infected and
[SPEAKER_00]: the chances of its spreading are quite a
bit higher You know, which is why I'm back
[SPEAKER_00]: to the you know screening thing because if
you can catch it early on with a sensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: enough test You can it's much easier to
contain and and keep it from spreading
[SPEAKER_00]: like that Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you intentionally have comments off?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just just just to be clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: So There is a So basically what we're
talking about is that we we've established
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a couple different things you can
do that really that really prevent Spread
[SPEAKER_04]: but the best thing is just to prevent it
from coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the ideal And then you know so and
you say that because you know one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: things that I see a lot of these places
when they offer TC or Marist em This is
[SPEAKER_04]: four to six thousand dollars often Yeah,
you're saying and it's it's very pricey
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're saying and it takes months,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're saying that it can be effective
But the people doing it have to be really
[SPEAKER_04]: talented at actually removing all of the
vascular only getting it down to the
[SPEAKER_04]: Marist em itself and starting from that
point and there's some luck to it as well,
[SPEAKER_03]: right like Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it's some of it's really knowing
What you're doing really understanding the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant getting the plant, you know really
healthy before you You know even attempt
[SPEAKER_00]: the process you want to pick the right the
right part of the plant or the you know
[SPEAKER_00]: The healthiest bit and then it's not going
to work on every single one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So numbers your test so maybe I could I
think I already know the answers to this
[SPEAKER_04]: but I have I'll just take you through some
bro science for a second on What people
[SPEAKER_04]: are doing to cure it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the one of the ways that people
have heard this learn it, you know is you
[SPEAKER_04]: clone out of it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a plant that you think has an
issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: You try to get it as healthy as humanly
possible, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You take some clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my my my method that was your
method you Healthiest clones you root it
[SPEAKER_04]: you get you you root it you take a clone
off it very soon You throw that away you
[SPEAKER_04]: cycle through repeatedly trying to like
sort of run the viroid Is this could be
[SPEAKER_04]: effective or is this sort of chasing your
own tail and it's it's So Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna say that it can't work
because I have not done the experiment and
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know and so You know this it could
potentially work One of the problems with
[SPEAKER_00]: the viroid is you don't need a lot to get
that infection again I mean one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: copies You're not gonna see much for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna take a while for it to build
enough to even be detectable on a test But
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit and you're you're right
back to an infected plant Chases the new
[SPEAKER_03]: growth right like correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it's it you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely you're playing a chasing
game, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it if if the plant was
just in Infected and it's moving down that
[SPEAKER_00]: first branch into the vascular system and
up if you can cut a clone off before it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets there like Intellectually,
it should be possible to grab a clone that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have it I don't you have to start
the race before you knew that you should
[SPEAKER_00]: be racing probably In order to outrun it
but then the next Right, so it's it's it's
[SPEAKER_03]: it sounds unlikely I tried that with the
trend so hard on the Trinity and and We I
[SPEAKER_03]: think we had it outdoors trying to chase
it up and out that way It was growing
[SPEAKER_03]: vigorous taking the healthiest cuts every
time and over a period of a year and a
[SPEAKER_03]: half It just was not it looked great and
then slowly but surely the traits would
[SPEAKER_04]: start showing back up again Yeah,
so then there's there's some big companies
[SPEAKER_04]: out there That have claimed that they had
dudding issues and they cured them by you
[SPEAKER_04]: know Dunking dunking plants and and
something like say zero tall or you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: putting a date Sanitate putting you know
soaking the roots so the roots uptake
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever sterilant it might be type of
thing and that they have cured it and
[SPEAKER_04]: never seen it since kind of gig and You
know, there's a there's a big push with
[SPEAKER_04]: any kind of nursery or any kind of big big
grow if anyone in the community Finds out
[SPEAKER_04]: that you have it They want to let everyone
know as soon as possible that they've
[SPEAKER_04]: solved it and then it's gone, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so You know, I have a certain amount
of skepticism that that would work from
[SPEAKER_04]: your experience that would not also not be
probably very effective No, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I guess to help people understand
Viroids are intercellular pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is they're not just in
the plant tissue there they're inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell and then once they get inside the
cell, there's actually another little tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: organelle in there called the nucleus and
so they traffic all the way into where the
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA of the plant is and they they hijack
the machine that's supposed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: interpreting the DNA for the plant and
they use it to replicate themselves and so
[SPEAKER_00]: any type of non-specific disinfectant that
would actually make its way all the Way
[SPEAKER_00]: into the nucleus of the plant and and
non-specifically destroy RNA would kill
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire plant Because RNA is used by
the plant to do its own biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So If basically you you could get it to
work by dropping your entire plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: bleach or something But it will just be
dead after like an hour or so,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So There's no way for a topical or you
know something that's being taken up that
[SPEAKER_00]: gets that's a non-specific disinfectant to
get all the way into the nucleus and Only
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy the Viroid and not the rest of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'll ask a related question,
but just more general So in your
[SPEAKER_04]: experience the only thing that has a
chance of curing it But even that is
[SPEAKER_04]: variable would be high quality Marist em
Tissue culture with testing afterwards to
[SPEAKER_04]: select the healthy ones and to get rid of
the ones that It remained you haven't seen
[SPEAKER_04]: anything else In you know so far that will
lead to success Yeah, so right now that is
[SPEAKER_00]: the only Option for a reasonable cure that
has evidence that it works that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean that there you know, there are ways
of Obviously genetic modification
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting for plants that are resistant
there there are things that You can
[SPEAKER_00]: basically mutate or deactivate in the
plant so that that by would can't traffic
[SPEAKER_00]: through the plant anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't replicate and then there are
They're more theoretical right now or you
[SPEAKER_00]: know still in the literature kind of
research zone some types of molecules that
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually encourage the secondary
immune system of the plant to respond
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically to the Viroid and that would
be By activating something called RNA I
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the plants version of the
secondary immune system Now none of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things as far as I'm aware are actual
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They they've just sown some success in
Academia in theory Yes, yeah, so they've
[SPEAKER_00]: shown they've shown some success,
you know in a scientific lab That's
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for for things that could work But
as far as I'm aware nothing's been turned
[SPEAKER_04]: into a product that people could I mean it
almost seems To me like an analogy that
[SPEAKER_04]: I've kind of started settling on as far as
like what it's gonna take to stop this
[SPEAKER_04]: thing is You almost need to start treating
your plants like they're in a tattoo
[SPEAKER_04]: parlor Right where you know where where
you know, you have every every plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know is gets clean gear Yeah,
you know people are you know every time
[SPEAKER_04]: you know that that level of because
obviously all those practices in tattoo
[SPEAKER_04]: parlors happened because we wanted to stop
transmission of HIV and hepatitis and all
[SPEAKER_04]: these other things that you know because
back in the day that wasn't so so much a
[SPEAKER_04]: worry and then it became a big worry and
then basically I believe not that I'm You
[SPEAKER_04]: know familiar with tattoo regulation,
but I pretty much believe that you have to
[SPEAKER_04]: have like autoclaves You have to have a
certain sterilization.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't even operate without these this
gear Yeah, make sure that you're not going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be a vector for spreading issues Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the entire industry is gonna
have to adopt standard operating
[SPEAKER_00]: procedures very similar to that and we
actually to help people kind of Remember
[SPEAKER_00]: what they need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've actually kind of created this dorky
little acronym called stop Like stop
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens that stands for you know sterile
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the sterilization of your tools
Sterilizing between plants sterilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: your pots the surfaces and everything
Testing regularly so that you know what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on and you can catch stuff early
Organizing your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the oh like flow of the people
organizing where your clones are sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a mom plant pops positive You don't
have to throw out every tray because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know where those plants are sitting
that came from that positive mom So
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about that and then the P is to
protect your borders, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't let anything in that hasn't been
tested and make sure that you're keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: infected stuff out So if you can go
through that whole stop Process then you
[SPEAKER_00]: stand, you know You're making the right
corrections to sort of keep the thing at
[SPEAKER_00]: bay and limit your economic exposure to it
So it's really it's basically,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, one of the aspects that people
People get mad about right where they want
[SPEAKER_04]: to talk about like being a Libertarian or
something like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we should have no rules is this In
positive aspect of regulation is it's
[SPEAKER_04]: there to force people that would never do
it To someone do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you know And so one of the one of the
hard parts about regulation for me right
[SPEAKER_04]: now is that because you don't have federal
Legality on any level every state is its
[SPEAKER_04]: own island Yep, so you know if we you
know, obviously winning in California
[SPEAKER_04]: would be big because you know,
it's it's gonna take much Like HIV or
[SPEAKER_04]: something like that at this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's so prevalent that it's going to
take years and a bunch of outreach and a
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch of knowledge to sort of slowly beat
back the tide for how much it spread when
[SPEAKER_04]: it was invisible and nobody could talk to
people like you and figure out how it even
[SPEAKER_04]: moved around Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's gonna it's gonna take a long
time and the entire industry working
[SPEAKER_00]: together and you know, I include people
like us in that as well because You know
[SPEAKER_00]: if you think about other industries like
human diagnostics or the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, you know or even veterinary
medicine There's a bunch of regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: and rules and standards for testing labs,
too You know, you've got to validate your
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to show like level of detection
You know all these things like inclusivity
[SPEAKER_00]: and specificity and positive predictive
value and all these things that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to do And when we came into this
we were used to working in human
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnostics where you know I mean there
was like this huge list of things you had
[SPEAKER_00]: to prove And realize that here,
you know, a lot of labs aren't doing any
[SPEAKER_00]: of those experiments, you know,
because there's no standards right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: No I just saw something proposed and I
don't know if it's going to I don't know
[SPEAKER_04]: exactly what it's gonna take effect But
they're starting to push for
[SPEAKER_04]: standardization of labs for THC and
terpenes and stuff Because there's a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of shady businesses going on with that
because there's no standards that people
[SPEAKER_04]: have to adhere to Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it's unfortunately I mean even
for for tissue culture and testing labs
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's no standards some of the
you know, it's not fair but some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility or way to protect yourself
is to Know the right questions to ask,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and if you if you find a testing
lab and and they You know, they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're gonna send your plants
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say hey, can you send me your
values?
[SPEAKER_00]: Validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me the experiments that you
did to prove that your test is accurate or
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive enough to detect it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a good lab a lab that's that's you
know Donnett's research should be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: send you a document where it spells out
the experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did their stuff works I mean in all
honesty having sourced clones for some
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty big scenes in the legal system most
nurseries are only really prepping say 10
[SPEAKER_04]: to 18 different strains for Their season
it's not like they might have a big
[SPEAKER_04]: library But they're only really they're
only picking so many things to mom up and
[SPEAKER_04]: offer numbers up So it wouldn't be that
prohibitively expensive like in winter for
[SPEAKER_04]: them to test these things Make sure the
moms they're propagating are clean You
[SPEAKER_04]: know and that it's not like they have to
put their entire collection through they
[SPEAKER_04]: just have to put what's in current
production Through correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean if you you know if you if You test
your mom's you know rigorously before you
[SPEAKER_00]: cut those clones and then You know,
even if you do like a really small random
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling of 5% of the clones All like the
entire SOP that we recommend is a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks per plant or something like that and
Like if you if you if you take all the
[SPEAKER_00]: costs together and calculate it per plant
and it's just totally worth it to not You
[SPEAKER_00]: know to feel confident that you're selling
somebody a good product Because I think
[SPEAKER_00]: nurseries to want to feel good that
they're giving people high-quality clones
[SPEAKER_03]: So and we trusted and stuff like that
human as it as a breeder to like I think
[SPEAKER_03]: it's becoming more incumbent upon
especially learning that there is even a
[SPEAKER_03]: remote possibility of the transmission
from Mother plant to seed stock because
[SPEAKER_03]: right now I mean it would be a great
solution for the current Problem right now
[SPEAKER_03]: with clones and the mass, you know I mean
like people are all pretty much growing
[SPEAKER_03]: the same shit like Whether hey,
it's all gelato cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm born born thereup, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But this could really be a good advocate
for more seeds more seed stock not relying
[SPEAKER_03]: on the same exact clone more diversity but
that only is great if also the breeders
[SPEAKER_03]: are also aspiring to the same level of
Testing that everyone else is yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean with eight with potentially up to
eight percent transmission to seed You
[SPEAKER_04]: know, of course Like just by the law
Murphy's law or whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the one that you pick is your winner Yeah
You know, you'd be like, oh this is the
[SPEAKER_04]: one I want this has the turps this has the
high this oh it has the latent Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I mean it's really gonna have to be
this the awareness of this the testing the
[SPEAKER_00]: you know The preventative nature is gonna
have to percolate into every faucet of
[SPEAKER_00]: this entire industry in order for
everybody as a collective to get the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: under control breeders clone producers,
you know, you know growers home growers I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean we grew a plant that had hoplite
environment in our basement, you know with
[SPEAKER_00]: no idea it just yeah, it's flowered and
we're like So, I mean it's it's it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole industry as and we all take
responsibility together And then I think
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we can start making a dent in it
Yeah, it's gonna take a lot of education
[SPEAKER_03]: for the actual end user And that's that's
always been the hardest part when it comes
[SPEAKER_03]: to like we do a lot of talk on on cannabis
genetics history seed history What have
[SPEAKER_03]: you and it's not always as important to
everyone like a lot of people have that
[SPEAKER_03]: genuine idea that it's dank who gives a
shit what it's called or what it is,
[SPEAKER_03]: but When it comes to stuff like this,
there's a reason that people care There's
[SPEAKER_03]: a reason that everybody takes is sets
these standards or aspires to these
[SPEAKER_03]: standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because We we give a shit we'd like
to see these these genetics carry on in
[SPEAKER_03]: the form that they are We don't want to
lose everything and and not paying
[SPEAKER_03]: attention not giving a shit not caring not
testing is a good way that to end up with
[SPEAKER_04]: Gelato for the rest of your life You know,
there's an issue with that and maybe maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: this is a this is a good time to bring it
up or whatever But you know in in regards
[SPEAKER_04]: to other to other agriculture one of the
things that Matt and myself and a number
[SPEAKER_04]: Of our friends are concerned about is that
with the uneven rolling out of
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that many people like I said before
care that much about holding on to old
[SPEAKER_04]: things, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's expensive and time-consuming But
it used to be that it was a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: more lucrative to do this and that allowed
you to fund You know your passion if it
[SPEAKER_04]: were right and so what I'm worried about
is that as we grow into this big industry
[SPEAKER_04]: You know we could lose like the legal
Legalization movement right now is
[SPEAKER_04]: probably a bigger threat to diversity than
even prohibition was Yeah, definitely in
[SPEAKER_04]: my opinion and then we could be looking
for like you were talking about Like maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: five or ten minutes ago in one of your
answers where you were saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know We might we can breed for
resistance to certain things We can bring
[SPEAKER_04]: you know You can look at like the banana
or other aspects of agriculture where some
[SPEAKER_04]: disease came in and crushed it and they
went and found varieties that resisted
[SPEAKER_04]: that and then Those became the standard
and so cannabis is going to in the next 10
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 30 40 years It's going to encounter
things that need to be dealt with like
[SPEAKER_04]: that Yeah, and we're not gonna know where
the answer lies But it probably lies in
[SPEAKER_04]: some plant that if it gets lost in the
next five years Due to all these things
[SPEAKER_04]: happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could end up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean I was joking about cookies and
gelato You know, even if those are your
[SPEAKER_04]: favorite strains, they might lack genetic
aspects that later on would be Critical
[SPEAKER_04]: for the survival of the plant as some kind
of bug or disease or viroid or whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: comes along I promise those those
definitely will not be the ones because
[SPEAKER_04]: they are so susceptible to everything
because This is this this might sound a
[SPEAKER_04]: little nerdy or something, but forgive me,
but I read this huge article on why You
[SPEAKER_04]: know 30 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when I was a kid every lots of people
hated Brussels sprouts Because they had
[SPEAKER_04]: this really offensive odor when cooked and
so what they did is they went back they
[SPEAKER_04]: figured Out that there was this one
substance within the Brussels sprout right
[SPEAKER_04]: that led to that aroma So they went back
and they've started breeding all these
[SPEAKER_04]: hundreds of varieties that were no longer
in production But were so saved in these
[SPEAKER_04]: various banks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they grew them all out They looked
for which ones had the least of this
[SPEAKER_04]: substance in it They started breeding them
together and lo and behold this new
[SPEAKER_04]: improved Brussels sprout That doesn't have
that funny cooked smell is now on your
[SPEAKER_04]: shelves in the store
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone could type it into Google and it'll
pop up that they literally rebuilt
[SPEAKER_04]: Brussels sprouts from the ground up
because they realized this aroma was
[SPEAKER_04]: really affecting its sales and so they
were able to go they were able to go back
[SPEAKER_04]: to the 50s 60s 70s 80s and grow out
hundreds of different varietals of
[SPEAKER_04]: Brussels looking for just low amounts of
this one compound and That's the type Of
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff that's gonna happen in cannabis in
the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we don't have a bunch of variety We
don't even know what we might need to go
[SPEAKER_00]: hunt for later Yeah, yeah, I think that
you know the fact that there isn't a bank
[SPEAKER_00]: like a centralized bank for all these
strains and cannabis is you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one of the serious issues right now
because you know, there's all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: cool stuff out there being made and
Unfortunately, maybe strains being lost,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and that's all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, which is and Hoplite and vibrates
obviously making it worse, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you know if you if it's
infected and you you can't afford tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture You don't want to go that route,
you know, then You know, I had this
[SPEAKER_04]: thought while we have you on and I know
this isn't tissue This isn't hoplite and
[SPEAKER_04]: related but it is somewhat related to
genetics And so I thought maybe we could
[SPEAKER_04]: get your your opinion on it and you can
say I know or I don't know But there's
[SPEAKER_04]: been some there's been some literature
coming out where it used to be for best
[SPEAKER_04]: practices for a long time was when you
were cloning and you were taking new
[SPEAKER_04]: mother stock that you always went for the
fast growing tops the tips of the plants
[SPEAKER_04]: all that and now there's been some
research it seems like that's been coming
[SPEAKER_04]: out that's been talking about how the top
of the plant might actually have more like
[SPEAKER_04]: More mutations and it would be safer to
keep that plant There would be less
[SPEAKER_04]: mutations lower down on the plant on the
lesser growth that as newer growth
[SPEAKER_04]: happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a greater chance of something odd
right and For us for a long time you
[SPEAKER_04]: always went for the healthiest newest
growing tips.
[SPEAKER_04]: We called it the cultivar cut Yeah,
and then and now it seems like there's
[SPEAKER_04]: been some evidence coming out that maybe
that's mistaken and that it might be safer
[SPEAKER_04]: to take new moms and new new genetic
material from the lower parts of the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: that have less of a likelihood of some
kind of mutation happening Is that
[SPEAKER_04]: something you're familiar with and seen?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could speak on or no So,
I mean I so I've read you know some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna speak with extreme
confidence sure I don't know that that
[SPEAKER_00]: body of literature as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I Do know that you know, so when
you're cutting plants clonal wise you're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking somatic tissue though somatic
tissue is everything that isn't the
[SPEAKER_00]: germline and it the the genome of somatic
tissue is not protected in the same way as
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to go through seed,
right because the germline is is really
[SPEAKER_00]: protected and so those tissues are gonna
accumulate more mutations and When you're
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning a mom, you're not Getting a new
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're you're actually have the same old
plant You know with the same somatic
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue and you're just continuing to
propagate this extremely old mom,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so that those somatic mutations
Over time will accumulate I you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: the people if you're trying to take the
apical Mary stem area that area contains
[SPEAKER_00]: new stem cells and so Beyond somatic
mutation beyond actual changes in the base
[SPEAKER_00]: pairs You also have these things called
epigenetic changes which they're like
[SPEAKER_00]: edits if you think of the DNA sequence as
as letters and words Epigenetics is like
[SPEAKER_00]: highlighting in a capital letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you scratch out a word So it's stuff
overlaid on top So a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: epigenetic changes are are reset in stem
cells Especially the freshly made ones and
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can get if you grab that top Part
or you use those stem cells you can
[SPEAKER_00]: revigorate the plant Whether or not
there's a big difference in somatic
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations like point mutations in the DNA
like the changes of the letters Dramatic
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to make a difference in the vigor
from the top to the bottom I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's and what kind of research there is
around that The ideal of course would be
[SPEAKER_00]: to take a really healthy vigorous Mom
plant and preserve that plant You know in
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture in stasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then you you bring out you take
the cuts and you bring it out and grow it
[SPEAKER_00]: up and then Take your clones or whatever
and then toss that and always go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant in stasis because you're gonna
have less somatic mutations If it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of hanging out at four degrees,
yeah That makes sense super ideal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I could get one more non-viroid
question and see if what you think so in
[SPEAKER_04]: in relation to that I mean keeping moms
healthy and stuff like that There's a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of talk in our community about oh the
plant got tired or it got cloned too much
[SPEAKER_04]: and it suffered genetic drift or things of
that nature Matt and I both have I mean I
[SPEAKER_04]: have A number of things that at this point
are, you know, 20 15 20 25 even 30 years
[SPEAKER_04]: old, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So pretty ancient in Canada's terms,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel that that kind like when
you're taking clones?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that if a plant starts to not
perform the way you want to it's because
[SPEAKER_04]: there's some mutations that happened or
there was some of what you just spoke
[SPEAKER_04]: about you believe it and you in the
genetics itself, you know some some
[SPEAKER_04]: undesirable Changes made made up happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think plants get old?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think they get tired?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you will I realize that that's a pro
term But it's thrown around enormously
[SPEAKER_04]: like the plants just tired the plant got
genetic drift You didn't clone off it when
[SPEAKER_04]: it was healthy enough and you ruined it
forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the same as it was It's not like
it was five years ago And so if you could
[SPEAKER_04]: talk a little bit if that's within your
knowledge base on what you think about
[SPEAKER_04]: that Kind of thing that would be very
helpful for people as well because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: thrown around enormously Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so There will be somatic mutations
that happen now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not Gonna be happening on a
massive scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so it's I mean there there can
be mutations here and there but it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's gonna take a completely healthy
plant and turn it into a total died,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know really fast I've heard a lot of
people Say things like that to like it
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped taking up nutrients or you know,
like somehow the plant randomly decided
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not gonna eat anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever I think a lot of times the
decline has to do with pathogens That you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know we're in there if you're if
you're experiencing a serious decline I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's much more likely to be some
type of pathogen than it is to be You know
[SPEAKER_03]: complete suicidal plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said it's hard to come across that I'm
sure Well, I mean for us it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know for humans, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a you know, we have a lifespan You
know, so if you if obviously you can't
[SPEAKER_04]: clone a person But you know you clone a
teenager and they're they're very healthy
[SPEAKER_04]: You clone an 80 year old and they're not
that healthy and I realize it's not the
[SPEAKER_04]: same thing at all But I just wonder like,
you know, these plants are theoretically
[SPEAKER_04]: in nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: They survive a season Yeah, and I have
clones I have clones that were are from
[SPEAKER_04]: the early 90s and So they've survived,
you know 32 seasons Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean mutations will accumulate in
you know, older somatic tissue and You
[SPEAKER_00]: know just like a person over time those
mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible that could lead to you know
decreased bigger I think it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on what you're seeing usually when
I when I hear people talk about it It's
[SPEAKER_00]: like it was fine last year and now this
year It looks like hell and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, that's not that time frame doesn't
fit, you know slow mutations accumulating
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant that sounds like a pathogen But
do I mean will a plant eventually get old,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and go, you know into Having
issues it sounds reasonable to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I don't know any literature on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now My thoughts not not data.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's I mean that's you know,
we're with this this podcast is about
[SPEAKER_04]: Thoughts, you know, and we always try you
know when we're talking about history
[SPEAKER_04]: Because most of cannabis history is oral.
[SPEAKER_04]: We always try to be like this is what we
know These are our educated guesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what we're pretty sure of but
there's disagreement amongst people and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's hard to say what's specific So this
is like right in our wheelhouse and what
[SPEAKER_03]: we deal with it really is you know,
it is because the general consensus when
[SPEAKER_03]: it comes to cannabis whether we're talking
about like I said reversals and and and
[SPEAKER_03]: sexual identity with cannabis or what have
you the answer is just it varies so
[SPEAKER_03]: heavily it varies so heavily and there
just isn't enough research yet and I think
[SPEAKER_03]: that's one thing that Anybody who delves
into the data just runs into constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: time to time again Yes, there's definitely
a lot of unknowns and very few knowns out
[SPEAKER_04]: there So, you know, we've been talking for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think mostly we got Our questions
answered.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel that way too Matt?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I do Maybe maybe you could plug,
you know, I noticed a number of times you
[SPEAKER_04]: mentioned you have some SOPs or you have
some best practices available on your
[SPEAKER_04]: website that people could go reference
Maybe you could talk a little bit just for
[SPEAKER_04]: a second about what you guys do what you
have available for people Resource wise
[SPEAKER_04]: testing wise that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So feel free for a minute to just sort of
lay into all that if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so, you know, we we definitely do
testing hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, that's the thing that's tested
the most often.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also offer a panel of testing for
Pythium as well as Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a panel of viruses and even a
viroid hop stunt viroid which hasn't been
[SPEAKER_00]: shown to be in cannabis yet, but it has a
really high Large host range and it has
[SPEAKER_00]: some pretty damaging effects and hops and
so You know, we're kind of screening
[SPEAKER_00]: things all the time to make sure that
we're kind of staying on top of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: Among the stuff that I am the most excited
about that was it's hoping hoping to come
[SPEAKER_00]: out at the beginning of next year is our
on-site testing platform So this is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the ways that we're trying to help the
industry bring the cost of doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: Routine testing down into a range where
people can afford it and so, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been working really hard at Evolving
a platform that we created to test for
[SPEAKER_00]: kovat in human saliva And evolving that
into the cannabis industry starting with
[SPEAKER_00]: testing for hoplite and viroid And the
thing that I'm most excited about it is
[SPEAKER_00]: that we we sat down with the chemistry
that currently existed isothermal
[SPEAKER_00]: amplification or lamp I think a lot of
people have heard of that and we started
[SPEAKER_00]: addressing some of the Weaknesses of that
technology the false positive rate the low
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitivity the you know, the lack of
internal control and We were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve that technology quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to bring the sensitivity
To the point where you should be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: detect about 95% of the reactions that are
found by a qPCR in the lab And the test
[SPEAKER_00]: can be judged, you know, it's a color
change test, but there is an internal
[SPEAKER_00]: control So you can tell if you've done the
test incorrectly or if your plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: negative and it also comes with an
analysis software, so If you want to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: high throughput if you'd like to do,
you know 96 plants at a time that's
[SPEAKER_00]: totally possible and that'll give you a
digital readout and so, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're really excited about bringing this
out because We've worked really hard at
[SPEAKER_00]: making this a really good test and a
really good tool and I think This is gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: help people do the type of testing that
they're gonna need to do to really Start.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah knocking thing down Okay And then
your is your website just is it to me
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics comm is it to know mix genomics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah to me genomics comm yeah,
I never came to my house
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I have a little twang but but so
that that's where people could go to read
[SPEAKER_04]: about the SOPs that you mentioned and some
of the some of the Data and stuff some of
[SPEAKER_04]: what we know There's an easy to reference
area on that where you can learn Yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we are constantly putting up new
content and we try to let people know in
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram when we're putting new stuff up
and There's a lot of I'm so I've just been
[SPEAKER_00]: busy making content and doing research to
help people out so You know what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna have some stuff about all the
different viruses and fibroids that are
[SPEAKER_00]: known in Cannabis the ones that aren't
known what you know, what's the evidence
[SPEAKER_00]: they exist?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which should you worried about which not a
lot of a lot of content like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So It's and it's all going up on the
website Just to help people figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: like to navigate all of this because
there's so much contradictory information
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's it's really difficult for
someone to figure out what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to do and what they should be
worried about and What's actually proven
[SPEAKER_00]: and what what is somebody just saying
something really confidently even though
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't actually know?
[SPEAKER_03]: We hear that a lot Yeah, like I said for
this episode the amount of people that
[SPEAKER_03]: told me exactly precisely how
transmissible this HPLV is in cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds was Astounding how many people were
sure, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like yeah So this this whole thing is very
helpful and we hope anything else that you
[SPEAKER_03]: guys work on whether it's it's it's these
new Different videos that you put out or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll bring it back to us and we can have
you on again to talk about more and any
[SPEAKER_03]: new findings with HPLV or anything
anything you think the cannabis community
[SPEAKER_03]: should know about or be aware of like this
because this is so important Yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we are like I said instigating
research studies and collaboration with
[SPEAKER_00]: Texas A&M and I'm hoping that that's
really gonna accelerate You know good
[SPEAKER_00]: science and real data and and as soon as
we find it I'd love to share it with the
[SPEAKER_00]: community because I think that's what's
really needed here is Quality research and
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of education so people understand
Maybe I could throw this out there just
[SPEAKER_04]: real quick and this and then we could end
it on that But you just mentioned Texas A
[SPEAKER_04]: &M, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Texas is not cannabis friendly yet So,
you know, what do you like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: what do you think about like obviously?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like bringing to bear some of these
colleges and some of these these
[SPEAKER_04]: departments and stuff like that that have
been working in Agriculture and other
[SPEAKER_04]: areas for a long time is going to be part
of the fabric of our new world How do they
[SPEAKER_04]: work on that in Texas?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they have to get special like federal
permission or something like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Texas law doesn't allow any I mean,
it's not California It's not anywhere
[SPEAKER_04]: where they have any kind of medical or
recreational program either It's it's one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the states that's anti still So in
Texas A&M, they work on hemp varieties You
[SPEAKER_00]: know the the the difference between a hemp
variety and you know, a THC containing
[SPEAKER_00]: variety is the amount of THC the plant has
So because it's in the farm bill they can
[SPEAKER_04]: work on it They can work they can test all
that stuff via the hemp and just get
[SPEAKER_04]: around the drug cult of drug cult of our
aspect or whatever Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you know, there are universities
like Colorado State University here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado is doing research and they
actually put out a paper where they did
[SPEAKER_00]: next-generation sequencing on Cannabis
looking specifically for what pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: are actually there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so there there are universities
They're starting to jump in the ring to
[SPEAKER_00]: and do research and I I really think that
that's where the answer is is You know
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborations between you know academia
and industry and open sharing of
[SPEAKER_00]: information So that everybody can benefit
from what's being learned both industry
[SPEAKER_03]: research and academia research the one
biggest bar between academia that I found
[SPEAKER_03]: and and maybe it maybe it's a bar between
academia the people who have the money and
[SPEAKER_03]: the actual cannabis people who've been
doing it, you know for decades is that not
[SPEAKER_03]: often to the people with the money or the
people with the ACI academia ever
[SPEAKER_03]: encounter the people behind the scenes
that are doing That are the people that
[SPEAKER_03]: have these collections that have been
doing the real research and taking real
[SPEAKER_03]: data Trying to keep it as straight as they
can not often do any of these people ever
[SPEAKER_03]: meet in the same real so I'm really hoping
that somehow that's that a bridge is is
[SPEAKER_03]: reached between academia and What they
would probably turn black market botanists
[SPEAKER_04]: the observational community The
observational community, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's a better way for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the major missions of our
company is I was an academic scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband was an academic scientist half
the scientists on our team were academic
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists and what we really want to do
is bridge that gap and bring Academia and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know all the knowledge in the cameras
industry and bring that all together and
[SPEAKER_04]: really get some some solid data I have
issues I have issues with like the terpene
[SPEAKER_04]: and THC testing Because I think it's so
inaccurate and I think it's led people to
[SPEAKER_04]: assume a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not true You know, and I don't
think we know yet like why plants why
[SPEAKER_04]: those why cannabis plants make us high?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right like and or why the different highs
happen like you can't look at a test and
[SPEAKER_04]: be like, oh This is gonna give me a racy
crawl out of my skin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm nervous feeling Versus like I want
potato chips and I'm giggly and I'm warm
[SPEAKER_04]: and happy and comfortable feeling right
and then you know I do we do testing all
[SPEAKER_04]: the time and it's like I you know,
they say that there's like a hundred and
[SPEAKER_04]: fifty different terpenes and cannabinoids
that they've discovered and they test for
[SPEAKER_00]: like 30 Yes, there's I think there's a
really big fixation right now on the level
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC and everybody wants the highest
level possible But I don't you know Based
[SPEAKER_00]: on personal experience now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not talking about data at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Just because it has a really high
level of THC does not mean that it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: give you You know give the consumer the
feeling that they were going for you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're much more complicated Than
that and I think we just don't know right
[SPEAKER_00]: now How all that stuff interacts with the
human body and with each with each
[SPEAKER_04]: chemicals at each other, you know Maybe
you know this from academia But I bet a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of people don't know this where
because cannabis was is a schedule one
[SPEAKER_04]: substance, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You needed the DEA's permission to test
for it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so during the war on drugs For a long
time if I went if I was a scientist and I
[SPEAKER_04]: went to the DEA and I was like I want to
see if cannabis lowers my blood pressure
[SPEAKER_04]: and makes me a happier person they would
deny me and If you went and said hey I
[SPEAKER_04]: want to test and see if cannabis makes me
more violent more prone to illegal acts
[SPEAKER_04]: and and raises my blood pressure They
would allow it so what's happened is we
[SPEAKER_04]: have like 40 or 50 years of cannabis
testing looking for negative correlations
[SPEAKER_04]: and effects and barely any looking at the
actual effects or if there could be
[SPEAKER_00]: positives Yeah, yeah, there's there's very
limited research and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the most frustrating things
and I was actually discussing this With a
[SPEAKER_00]: lawyer at a cannabis conference is that to
get something off the schedule one list
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do research to prove that it's
not dangerous But you're not allowed to do
[SPEAKER_00]: research on things on the schedule one
list.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're caught in the catch-22 Exactly,
the DEA was able to prevent anything from
[SPEAKER_04]: messing with their narrative By them
having a bottleneck and you had to get
[SPEAKER_04]: their permission to actually have cannabis
to test with Yeah Yeah, no, I mean and I
[SPEAKER_00]: am really hoping that this is gonna change
because there there needs to be so much
[SPEAKER_00]: research and you know from a virology
pathogen biology perspective having a
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir of pathogens in a Plant where
we're not doing any research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not monitoring it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's dangerous for all of agriculture
Sure effective of what you think about the
[SPEAKER_00]: legality if we're not doing research on
it, then everything is Threatened by it,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially with legality.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to take all the cannabis out of
the hills and mountains where it thrived
[SPEAKER_04]: and they want to bring it down to the
valleys and the ag land and Next to a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of other kinds of crops Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I mean and we need research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to understand what pathogens are
there Which one you're coming,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and how to keep you know,
all of agriculture safe like how they do
[SPEAKER_00]: with all the other crops Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're about two hours here,
which is normally when we cut it I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: know we I want to thank you so much for
coming on and chatting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really engaging And it cleared up a
lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wrote down a lot of questions and It's
good to hear the state of where we are You
[SPEAKER_04]: know where we know we are and where we're
worried about and all that and so maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt if you want to Do your end of the end
of the evening plug and then we can all
[SPEAKER_04]: have a good night.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great Yeah, well,
thanks a lot for coming on Tassie We
[SPEAKER_03]: really appreciate you and to me genomics
and everything you are doing to help us to
[SPEAKER_03]: help bring us into the new In this new
weird feature that is cannabis for a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of us that have been very resistant to it
Like I didn't do a lot of testing myself
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the years like early on because it
was so expensive and just didn't make a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of sense But I think we're at that
point where testing has to be A mainstay
[SPEAKER_03]: so we appreciate you bringing your
knowledge and everything you've learned
[SPEAKER_03]: for free here to share with everyone Yeah,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was actually a lot of fun I Love
talking about science so and teach
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks you guys so much for inviting me
here Well, we're happy to have you for
[SPEAKER_03]: melt all of us here breeder syndicate go
check out our patreon breeder senior
[SPEAKER_03]: patreon Go to Google type in breeder
syndicate patreon you end up there go
[SPEAKER_03]: check out right seeds calm proceeds and
reversal spray and that will be This will
[SPEAKER_04]: be put up on YouTube shortly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as always, thank you very much for
your Friday night much appreciated Bye
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone Thank you And You You
