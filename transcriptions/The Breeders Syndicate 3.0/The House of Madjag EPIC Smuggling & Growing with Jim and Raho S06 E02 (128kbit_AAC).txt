[SPEAKER_00]: Total gentleman's contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't enforce it, no way to do it,
but it's just a simple handshake deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the idea for this from another
YouTuber named Jesse On Fire, and I felt
[SPEAKER_00]: like it was fair for him to ask,
so I figured I'd do the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honor system re-engaged in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeder Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_00]: clandestine scene, researching everything
from cannabis strain history, old
[SPEAKER_00]: smuggling tales from the first-person
perspective, to breeding science and news
[SPEAKER_00]: on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie,
[SPEAKER_00]: Natsodog, Breeder and grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_00]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeder Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be part two of the Mad
Jag and Rojo series, and of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: joined here by my friend, Natsodog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, we really had a good time
recording the show last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was probably the largest
response we've ever gotten for any show as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as the positivity that we received.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really resonated with a lot of people,
and I'm really excited to start with round
[SPEAKER_00]: two, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to go in a more linear pattern,
and we covered some of the canyon era,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I know after we recorded last time,
we spoke a little bit and you have some
[SPEAKER_00]: notes and a good direction, so I'm going
to let you go ahead and start,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mad Jag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you want to start the tale?
[SPEAKER_02]: The 1978 map that I drew, it says OG,
stands for original garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the 1978 map if you want to explain
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit and break it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The key is at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is before skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the very first.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a friend in Kauai who had Oaxacan
Hawaiian crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the H10, H9, HK, and then we had
somehow a few Thai seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where they came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Colombian came from my friend,
and they're the ones that on Thanksgiving
[SPEAKER_02]: while it was snowing above us on the rim
weren't even close to being finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the layout of that garden that
you showed photos of last time that blends
[SPEAKER_02]: in so well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's surrounded by pine trees and lots of
heavy dark green brush.
[SPEAKER_02]: This garden was probably, I'm thinking 100
feet long and 50 feet wide.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the old notebooks that you
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time you were drawing this as you
were looking on?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it work?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just all of them every year I did one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was at the middle part of our canyon.
[SPEAKER_02]: The subsequent years, 79, 80, and 81 were
about two or three miles further up the
[SPEAKER_02]: canyon than this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one was closer to 1,800 feet down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a longer hike, more difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: The others were anywhere from 14 to 1,600
feet down in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes a difference at the end of the
year, of course, when you're carrying your
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we did as much as possible down
inside the canyon later by having friends
[SPEAKER_02]: come down in and camp with us because it
wasn't feasible to carry out whole plants
[SPEAKER_02]: or branches or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you find that any of these grew any
different in these little microclimates in
[SPEAKER_00]: the canyon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of these strains from between 78 and
79, if you moved or grew any of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: exact strains in different little
locations in the canyon, did you find any
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypic variations?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just more of the size and ripeness
because this particular garden got the sun
[SPEAKER_02]: east to west.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had the most sun in 10, 11 hours at
some days in the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grew much larger plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these plants were 13, 14 feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: My partner is six foot seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a photo of him reaching up in his
wizard outfit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: His reach is at nine feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're four or five feet beyond his
reach.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the Hawaiians H10 over here
where it says H10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right over in this region, H10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Far left of this drawing where it says H10
and also in the middle there, H10.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just massive plants,
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good smoke too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Oaxacan again, crossed with
whatever they were calling Hawaiian,
[SPEAKER_02]: which has a Thai background just because
Hawaii, probably in the 40s and 50s,
[SPEAKER_02]: people from the Far East that visited
there, it'd be very easy to see those
[SPEAKER_02]: sorts of varieties showing up in another
tropical area.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is crazy, Madjag, because I drew a
plot like this for, a map like this for
[SPEAKER_04]: just about every outdoor plot I ever did.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy to see that two people on other
sides of the country at the same time are
[SPEAKER_04]: doing the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beyond the fact that I did it,
yours is the level of detail and artistry
[SPEAKER_04]: is way beyond anything I ever did,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really cool to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I might want to ask,
just because I remember something you
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned last time, which was basically
you averaged about 6.8 or seven ounces of
[SPEAKER_03]: plant or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I just heard you say that you had
these nine to 13 foot tall plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: these giants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you could talk a little bit about
some of the different stuff that you grew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was a nine foot or 10 foot tall plant only
giving you that amount of flower because
[SPEAKER_03]: of how loose it was?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have some that were a lot denser
and they were smaller plants, but yielded
[SPEAKER_03]: more?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have old timers that would tell
me that back in the day, they would get
[SPEAKER_03]: ounces that were the size of my forearm,
just because the weed wasn't as dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious as to was the 6.8 ounces,
the stuff that happened in subsequent
[SPEAKER_03]: years when you were doing the skunk one,
did you get a massive variance of weights
[SPEAKER_03]: and sizes these first couple of years when
you were experiencing them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 6.8 ounces average across the entire
two gardens that we did later were almost
[SPEAKER_02]: all skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tallest plants were six, seven,
eight feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Hawaiian in this particular drawing
that were so tall, they were multi-pound
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have a scale at the time down in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the later years, we brought a dialygram
down O'House.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good old dialygram.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would go up to two pounds, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this plant in particular, it was
obviously pounds of weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were tight buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They aren't rock buds like some,
especially the ones I know of friends who
[SPEAKER_02]: grow, heavily indica backgrounds,
those buds just get rock hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Density is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dried.
[SPEAKER_02]: These, a pound of this herb probably was
twice the size of the later skunk number
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The skunk number one were denser,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a quick question that I've just
been, as going through the pictures and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, which wizard were you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which color?
[SPEAKER_02]: We alternated out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, did you?
[SPEAKER_02]: This was not me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was my friend, Doug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The light blue one was my UK partner that
you have in a photo where he's pointing
[SPEAKER_02]: off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, you used it in this
advertisement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's pointing out into the distance.
[SPEAKER_02]: The garden is actually right below him,
but we had him pointing in a direction
[SPEAKER_02]: that wouldn't be as easy to figure out if
you got to that canyon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never wore the light blue one because I
think it was a smaller robe.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the one I'm wearing?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one of me and my tall partner
walking across the rug.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is, the white one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you got it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the one in front.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just see my beard back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: My ex-wife, my kid's mom, she's the one
who sewed these up for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: She made all of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: That red bag there was particularly
colorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was up with the idea too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know whatever happened to these
costumes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my next question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't keep at least one around,
but I think 45 years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what really pulled me to your story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first, like I said, heard about or even
found out what Madjag was going through
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam's old posts and going through the kilo
art.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept seeing this really pretty kilo art
that said Madjag on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what started that journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I saw these pictures of the
robes is when I was like, these are my
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are my people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to find out who they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That log right there that we're walking
across, there was a storm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was camped on the side that this photo
was taken from by our third friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water was almost touching the bottom of
this log.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to sit on it and scoot across with a
bag of weed in front of me and scoot
[SPEAKER_02]: across.
[SPEAKER_02]: It ran for like three days from this
massive fall storm like in October.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good thing that thing was there or
else I would have been stuck on the other
[SPEAKER_02]: side.
[SPEAKER_02]: As it was, I was in a silly old army tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't have a built-in bottom and the
water was flowing through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to get out in the pouring rain and
cut a trench around it like you do in Boy
[SPEAKER_02]: Scouts to funnel the water away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a wilderness experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember last week, we were talking
about how growing these plants turns you
[SPEAKER_04]: into an instant young entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_04]: The inspiration, I've often wondered,
what were your intentions when you guys
[SPEAKER_04]: came up with this whole Madjag branding
idea and started sending stuff into high
[SPEAKER_04]: times?
[SPEAKER_04]: What was going through your head when you
were starting that thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like early viral marketing stuff
is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Viral didn't even exist that term,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were inspired by High Times Magazine,
by The Grower's Guide, and then later
[SPEAKER_02]: Robert Clark's book.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just seemed like let's make our own
legend and maybe someday we'll be doing a
[SPEAKER_02]: movie about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was with that in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't that it would make us richer and
we would get paid more for the herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would set us apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we went and had labels made,
the crack and peel labels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be glad to send you guys some because
I've kept a lot of them over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go through like an airport.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I was going up the escalator
and I had one cracked and open.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just slapped it on the side of a
newspaper magazine dispenser in Los
[SPEAKER_02]: Angeles.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my friends, the guy in Tempe,
his brother who was a bigger dealer even
[SPEAKER_02]: than he, said, did you put one of your
stickers in the airport in LA?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: That reminds me so much of early
skateboarding culture in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was some of the earliest viral
marketing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: The things that they pioneered back then
in skateboarding was skateboarder
[SPEAKER_04]: magazine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's absolutely the foundation of viral
internet marketing today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Social media influencers, all that stuff
has roots going directly back to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see a lot of that in your Madjag stuff
too, Jim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of that in the Hayes poster,
the Cosmic Boogie poster.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was why I chased that so hard was
because as a person who sells seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: has made that my passion breeding and all
that, to me, that was the first time that
[SPEAKER_00]: I could find a physical, tangible
representation of something I could
[SPEAKER_00]: possess that was a perfect example of the
first strain marketing that I could find.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Madjag label, I put it in that same
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those early things,
striking imagery that you never forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was done so well, but I never forgot it
and always chased it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like a pre-Reagan era of
freedom where everyone thought things were
[SPEAKER_03]: about to loosen up, and then they were
loose for a bit, and then they went in a
[SPEAKER_03]: totally different direction for 15 more
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still these old posters that you
can ... I found them a few times and I
[SPEAKER_00]: never bought one, but there's an old
poster where it's like they made them
[SPEAKER_00]: declaring that, ah, we finally did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition's over posters, but they were
just a little bit too early.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I'm curious about and the actual
growing part of it is since it sounds like
[SPEAKER_03]: you were basically this first season,
you were just collecting seeds from
[SPEAKER_03]: friends and people you could get access
to.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were the things that you liked and
disliked about the first crop?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you look at those things when you were
trying to get away with it and you were
[SPEAKER_03]: like, oh my God, this 13-foot plant is
blowing past all the bushes and everything
[SPEAKER_03]: else that we were trying to contain it and
make it look like it was normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to do that giant again
because it makes me nervous.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were the thoughts there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because obviously this is the first time
that you were seeing a lot of these things
[SPEAKER_03]: grown, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you had no idea what to expect,
really.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just, oh, this is Oaxacan,
and this is Hawaiian, and this is this,
[SPEAKER_03]: and this is that, and it was like plant
spacing and how big they were going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: and what they were going to do was all a
mystery, I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had had the one year before this with my
dealer friend from Tempe in a neighboring
[SPEAKER_02]: canyon, and that's the first time I got a
chance to see plants actually reach
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were all Mexican strains,
like you said, but over the next year,
[SPEAKER_02]: the next year, we tried a garden in that
canyon that was massive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to pump up 200 feet to the alluvial
plateau we had found, and it wasn't really
[SPEAKER_02]: smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good thing it failed, but we got a
submersible pump that weighed like 40
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds and hosed going up, and the first
time we watered, we laid a hose on the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground and it just went, it disappeared
into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it this garden?
[SPEAKER_02]: We moved it another 50 feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just made a hole and went down in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't flood irrigate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so loose with boulders and stuff
below, even though it was this beautiful,
[SPEAKER_02]: smooth garden on top that it just didn't
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like dredging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and then the following year,
we had collected all these other seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: Thai, Colombian, and I knew from that very
first year how to do it, and we just went
[SPEAKER_02]: on a larger scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Colombian, though, we had no idea,
like we discovered, how long it took to
[SPEAKER_02]: finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just knew it was super great weed that
we had smoked, and we kept the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: On this garden, I'd say 30% of it failed
because it wasn't ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this the garden that's up here,
correct, showing the year you're speaking
[SPEAKER_02]: about?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this one is 1980.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were looking at the 78 earlier that had
the key at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one are you speaking about
currently?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one that I want to hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The original one, 1978.
[SPEAKER_03]: OG.
That one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one that 30% failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: By failed, you mean just didn't finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were huge plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one photo that he has from last
episode, they were beautiful plants in
[SPEAKER_02]: slightly different colors because they
were different Colombian seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the C10 here, C9, wherever the C shows
up, they were big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make it easier to see right
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I zoom out, it might be too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually, did you just end up having to
chop them down, and you just realized they
[SPEAKER_03]: weren't done, they weren't real weed yet,
and kind of composted them down there?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we took them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the ones that I had to scoot
across that boulder with in a bag once we
[SPEAKER_02]: cut them down to branch size.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the size of my little fingertip,
buds, and they were kind of tight and
[SPEAKER_02]: nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sold them, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just a very mild smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had resin, but not like they would
have been super killer weed if they'd
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten a month and a half more or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: End of December, early January,
like they would in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me maybe ask you this because I don't
think we talked about this last time.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the area that you were in, what month
or around what date was it safe to plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then what was the latter part of your
harvest window where after that it was
[SPEAKER_03]: cold and rainy and you were in fear of
losing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily, those giant Hawaiian plants,
because they were Oaxacan crosses too,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were ready in October, and no later
than mid-October, I'd say probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rains and cold didn't really hit us.
[SPEAKER_02]: October, traditionally in Arizona,
is the second driest month of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: June is the driest October, and this is in
the 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has changed since then, but we had a
beautiful fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Down in the canyon, they had cool nights,
but the days would be warm and nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We harvested everything out of this garden
except those Colombian, and we were going
[SPEAKER_02]: back and watering them and back and
watering them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, on Thanksgiving, when it was
snowing up above and we had to go out on
[SPEAKER_02]: the mesas in inches of snow and big clods
of mud on our feet, we decided we have to
[SPEAKER_02]: take them now because we didn't want to
come back any colder and wetter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just never reached maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the earlier ones, all these others,
the Hawaiians who were pushed came out
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were able to hang them there in the
shade, dry them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember, actually, we didn't have
breakdown boxes like we did in following
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just, I think, put them in big garbage
bags and carried them up top of the rim
[SPEAKER_02]: with our pack frames.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had metal pack frames, Kelty's,
and we would just strap everything to
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they didn't get handled as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we had breakdown boxes, after the
skunk number one was manicured,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was put right into these wonderful
cardboard boxes that we bought stacks of
[SPEAKER_02]: and brought them down, and then we
assembled them down in the canyon,
[SPEAKER_02]: taped them, and you could carry six or
seven stacked on a pack frame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any more than that, they would be catching
on branches and it wasn't feasible.
[SPEAKER_02]: That came out very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't get crushed, they didn't get
smashed, pounded a time roughly in each
[SPEAKER_02]: box.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 1979 harvest, was that the one that
ended up in the high times?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what was referred to in that high
times that is up here on the page?
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see here it says, Colombian stock,
killer purple, 2,000 pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was funny because one guy actually paid
us 2,000 a pound for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we had some lightly seeded Hawaiian,
one branch out of all this garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: We came back after, as we traditionally
did every week, we were looking through,
[SPEAKER_02]: inspecting, and then we found one branch
that was seeded.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had hermit back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took a garbage bag and put it over
quickly, cut that branch off, but it had
[SPEAKER_02]: enough time to lightly seed a few of the
plants neighboring to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people love finding those few seeds
and they were like, do you have any more
[SPEAKER_02]: of this?
[SPEAKER_02]: They like the smoke and it was the Oaxacan
Hawaiian stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of these in this list are from
you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: On this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, on this particular list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the one that says Hawaiian magic,
Sinseamia.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these others were current things on
the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like downtown Maryland.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something we didn't actually chat
about last time, but it's pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you guys were doing your gorilla,
obviously, you can get a wildly divergent
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of males and females off a batch of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you plant everything in your alluvial
plains and all that and then just cut
[SPEAKER_03]: males as they appeared?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you plant them in pot you did?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you go out there more than once a week
when things were turning from veg to
[SPEAKER_03]: flower so that you didn't show up and all
of a sudden a stray male had nuked a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: patch with seed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or how did you handle the transition when
you were worried about maybe we haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: caught all the males yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the next garden marked as 1979 as
the Double E.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason we called it the Double E is it
was on a topo map right under the word
[SPEAKER_02]: creek where the Double E's were.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went, oh, that's an easy way to spot
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we called it the Double E.
[SPEAKER_02]: We spent three nights, I mean,
three days and two nights every week on
[SPEAKER_02]: the next three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't just go out overnight and water
and then leave the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were there three days out of seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we anything that was even remotely
spooky looking like, wow, this might be a
[SPEAKER_02]: male change in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We then I don't know, we might have just
prematurely cut them out, but everything
[SPEAKER_02]: was grown from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the year we ran two gardens are big,
big here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good thing I bought three thousand seeds
because the plants were about a foot tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we came back a week three days later,
four days later, and grasshoppers had
[SPEAKER_02]: eaten them down every single one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to replant on the first of June.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put them in a tiny seed garden area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where we could put a screening over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were super crowded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were just digging them out with wet
inner palm in our hands and plugging them
[SPEAKER_02]: in, plugging them in, plugging them in and
replacing everything that had been eaten
[SPEAKER_02]: by.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was weird, there was a few plants
that made it through from the grasshopper
[SPEAKER_02]: plague.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ones that we planted and they were
like a month, a month earlier than the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones we had to replant in June.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe more than a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the June ones caught up with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing because of the 100 degree
weather and the sun and the watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time end of the summer,
like let's say August was around,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were all equal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But having that little six foot by 10 foot
garden full of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily, we were able to replant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, it would have been
catastrophic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe maybe another angle is where
did you first learn about what an early
[SPEAKER_03]: female or an early male even looked like
back then?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Rob Clark's book?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it high times?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it people telling you?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because obviously, like now,
you know, like, you look at it and like
[SPEAKER_03]: two pistols mean a female and a little
claw looking thing means a male.
[SPEAKER_03]: But back then, did you have that kind of
knowledge beforehand?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they get kind of advanced before you
realized what they were?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I I'm not exactly sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know from the first year in 1976 that we
grew, I got to see what males look like
[SPEAKER_02]: and females, but not till they were
probably more advanced and visible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Rob Clark, I mean, his early book,
the one that he did in 77, on pod press
[SPEAKER_02]: that was actually his dissertation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That he he hand drew all the drawings in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cover every single plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hand drew those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's not only.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's a he's a good artist,
plus his photography later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, he says when he traveled around and
did that book on hashish, the photos are
[SPEAKER_02]: just excellent, you know, watering and the
growers guide by Mel Frank that I think
[SPEAKER_02]: showed I don't know if they were photos,
but it was a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by this year, I had already grown for
two years before this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not the original garden, but by 1980.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we went for two gardens at once,
we had enough experience to know what to
[SPEAKER_02]: look for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, we were spending three days a week
in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think maybe even at the time when
the males had to be separated,
[SPEAKER_02]: we might have just had one of our we had a
third partner who helped us part time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's still a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw him when I went to span of this in
2019 and stayed at his house last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's he's five years older than I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's he still smokes hash mixed with
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been doing it for 50 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the custom over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's an artist, of course,
Swiss artist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he may have just been down there and
as because I know what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ended up it was almost 50, 50 with the
skunk 50, 50 males, 50, 50 females.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't end up with big, huge,
empty sections of the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also transplanted into any open
sections if we had to.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would dig up a plant that was four feet
tall with a big group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And slide it over five more feet to get it
into a hole that had more sun and and was
[SPEAKER_02]: empty because a male had been removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we did a lot of transplanting and
movements.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was experimental to see if it would
work in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very hardy plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there is resilience.
[SPEAKER_02]: The term weed is is accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you know, Jackie, we last week
we talked about the turps and flavors of
[SPEAKER_04]: Colombian.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, you were just talking about
that first year where the Colombians
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't finish, but you got a few purple
ones out of there that were, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: that were made good smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I wasn't really satisfied
with my answer last week when I was asked
[SPEAKER_04]: what what did I describe those those
flavors and smells coming off of
[SPEAKER_04]: Colombian?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I realized as I thought
back on it that, you know, that most of my
[SPEAKER_04]: experience and what I know about Colombian
is more about what came imported,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and was bought than what I grew
because it just it was just so difficult
[SPEAKER_04]: to pull those things off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, for me, it's it's such a
treat that we have, you know, we have it's
[SPEAKER_04]: the the essence of it captured in the
ohays as Sam shared it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that that because otherwise it's
so hard to grow, you know, growers all
[SPEAKER_04]: over the country were like they tried and
it didn't turn out well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they found something better and
the stuff just kind of disappeared.
So.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, can you talk about that
that Colombian, the smells?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, did the anthocyanin or whatever
the purple?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did that really take over and dominate the
one that you managed to to harvest and or,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they were they.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because it was like, you know,
it was Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you know, when that light starts
dropping down, the purple tends to happen
[SPEAKER_02]: more and it it didn't really have a
characteristic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Hawaiians that were Oaxacan crosses,
they had a wonderful scent growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the Colombian, because they didn't
even have the tiny buds till like late
[SPEAKER_02]: October, beginning of November,
they they didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't warm like the hot summer end of
the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have really much sense at all
until they were dried and then you crushed
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know what you're talking about,
the piney.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how you would, you know,
focused on the piney last week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, you know, I had a lot of that,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, like I said, all my school,
all my friends at school, everybody was
[SPEAKER_04]: growing these Colombian plants and the
Christmas trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody had these little Christmas trees
out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But some people, they got more mature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, you got you got a really
nice buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the pine was was dominant for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, the diversity of what we
got in the imported smoke was just above
[SPEAKER_04]: and beyond.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because the golds and the reds
and, you know, yeah, yeah, just some
[SPEAKER_04]: amazing stuff, you know, and old and
distinctive, you know, each one just such
[SPEAKER_04]: a unique, distinctive thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like Mexico, all of them,
you know, whether it's Sinaloa or Guerrero
[SPEAKER_02]: or Oaxaca.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Entirely the way they looked, they smelled
and the highs, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Mexico is a long country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombia is pretty big, but there's in
Colombia, it was like tropical versus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, five thousand foot level versus
Santa Marta, way up at eight thousand,
[SPEAKER_02]: nine thousand feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it they were land races that didn't
really get mixed up too much back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: old days, at least until the 60s,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the impact of the processing and
transport to, you know, whatever it was in
[SPEAKER_04]: Colombia before it went on the boat or in
the in the case of the high grade stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: like the golds and the reds, you know,
maybe on an airplane, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: that that had such an impact on it,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But so I think a lot about the commercial
stuff that, you know, we used to buy on
[SPEAKER_04]: the street or sell even.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, what what I think is
interesting is that the essence of that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, that it was a shadow of what it
was when they when they finished it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the essence of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that we could throw in there is
that a number of people that have talked
[SPEAKER_03]: to Matt and I about growing in that era,
when they first grew green marijuana,
[SPEAKER_03]: they got scared because they didn't think
people would want it because all the stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: they got was brown or yellow or gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why that's why I asked last week if
they if they sun dried because that tends
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the way that the Mexicans and stuff
are getting their golds like girdling or
[SPEAKER_00]: sun drying.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've heard that consistently that a
lot of times the first home grows are the
[SPEAKER_03]: first outdoors that people did in
different regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, oh, my God, it's such a
weird color.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's green.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are people going to like it?
[SPEAKER_03]: They've never seen it before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, obviously, like now it's
shifted.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm curious is when you did your when
you did your your shade drying and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that, what kind of colors were you
getting?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it staying green?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it turning golds and yellows and
browns?
[SPEAKER_02]: No gold, yellows or browns, just greens or
dark greens that the skunk number one was
[SPEAKER_02]: super dark green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even in 76, when we my dealer friend
and I grew that first year, the proof was
[SPEAKER_02]: in the pudding, we would give people a
smoke, just one puff or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were overwhelmed if they were
used to commercial stuff and seedless.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had not seen seedless really,
unless they had gotten tie sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tie sticks were pretty much always seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seedless and the tie sticks back then were
not green.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were brown or, you know, and they're
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the light green.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even give that a thought because
once our few people that bought from us
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all they cared.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they bought everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two people bought everything we grew,
basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because we heard we heard people
telling us stories about how when they
[SPEAKER_03]: first grew green weed, they tried to brown
it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like, oh, man, no one's going to
want this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the right color.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't look right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't look like anything we've ever had.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to do something.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and not only that, but some of the
earliest, you know, when people have a bad
[SPEAKER_04]: experience with green weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, the guy who grows,
you know, a patch full of Colombian and it
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't finish and he harvests this leafy
stuff with just a few white hairs and
[SPEAKER_04]: mostly tops.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, he handles it poorly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's loaded with chlorophyll and he tries.
[SPEAKER_04]: He sells it to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, all of a sudden there's
this bad reputation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Green weed is bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the next year, people grow
different seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: This shit gets mature.
[SPEAKER_04]: They handle it better, you know,
and all of a sudden there's there's high
[SPEAKER_04]: quality green weed, but people's
perception of the color is that it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: turnoff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got to try and overcome that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting them to, you know, try it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, this is different or whatever,
or the thing about renaming or changing
[SPEAKER_04]: the appearance.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, a lot of people would,
you know, we knew that the stuff molded,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, that the Colombian that turned
it brown, it was some sort of mold from
[SPEAKER_04]: being pressed when it was still wet or
carried in the cargo bay of the ship or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so since we'd been smoking that stuff
for years and, you know, people thought
[SPEAKER_04]: that was okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they might try and, you know,
they might try and press some other wet
[SPEAKER_04]: homegrown and get a different appearance,
but it never turned out like the
[SPEAKER_04]: Colombian, you know, and it only wound up
making it worse.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that chlorophyll was pretty horrible
to smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you had those unfinished tops that
somebody was trying to pass off as smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, and plus high times was,
you know, was, was becoming really
[SPEAKER_04]: popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people were hearing about green from
Hawaii and California by the time I was in
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the thing for us was, you know,
I mean, I would, I had produced some
[SPEAKER_04]: amazing freaking indica buds, but I would
say it was Hawaiian, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: or from California just because,
you know, your homegrown isn't,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, cause I was charging 200 and
ounce for this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and people were happy to pay it,
even though, you know, as kids,
[SPEAKER_04]: they didn't have a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would find a way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a guy, I had a guy trade me a PPA
system with, you know, with a beautiful
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike and a, and a fender backstage 20 for,
for a half ounce of tie purple tie.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He loved it so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: He came back for more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately I was out of that and
all I had was the green Fino, which didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: finish at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, okay, well, you know,
I knew it wasn't the same stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I wanted the money.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, I sold him that second bag and,
and he was so pissed off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wound up giving his money back because
it wasn't even close to the same thing as
[SPEAKER_04]: the purple one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with, with the skunk one, did you
notice any like solely broadleaf
[SPEAKER_00]: expressions, stuff that looked just pure
Afghani in the skunk one cop?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one of the photos that you posted
last week, I think what was interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: about the skunk was it, it grew like long
colas and they were almost self pruning in
[SPEAKER_02]: the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sun leaves would all turn yellow and
you could just shake the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would fall off and leave these long
green colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have one photo from that I took that
is just slightly blurry, but it's just a
[SPEAKER_02]: series of the four, four to six foot tall
colas, you know, like one cola coming out
[SPEAKER_02]: of the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are the ones that were 6.8
ounces, you know, on average, it was dense
[SPEAKER_02]: and nice, very deep, deep green,
but there was no Indica fat leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: expressions solely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was truly true breeding at that time,
what Robert and Sam had accomplished.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Robert was more of the geneticist
in doing it, but there's some,
[SPEAKER_02]: some place in the history where they said
they had 10,000 things going in red cups
[SPEAKER_02]: and they chose from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if that's accurate,
but.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really, when we planted it,
it grew the way it looked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each plant, they had a little bit wider
leaves, certainly than like Acapulco gold
[SPEAKER_02]: or Santa Marta, tropical thin leaf,
but nothing like the, deep chunk or maple
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf Indicas that, you know, people add
on, on IC mag that look just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, umbrellas almost, you could hold
your head if it's raining.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dinosaur leaves.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it your impression then?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously you said before that you
reached out to, you reached out to,
[SPEAKER_03]: to Rob through a letter and contacted him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he brought you the seeds is what you
said, previously when it, did you meet Sam
[SPEAKER_03]: back then?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he talk about their partnership?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he, did they, did he tell you any of
the work that he had done to get to skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he share?
[SPEAKER_02]: All my info came from Robert.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never met Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never talked to him personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I've private message with him on IC
mag in 2012, but nothing I've,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've sent him some labels.
[SPEAKER_02]: For his collection, but I don't,
I've never met him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all secondhand from Robert when he
described.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I don't know if Rob was,
when I got on, when I got on there,
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam was very big.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I saw all of his collection
of, of, you know, essentially breeder art
[SPEAKER_03]: and grower art that they would,
that they would make and attach to their
[SPEAKER_03]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would post a lot in something called,
I was, was it called the breeder's lab?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something along those lines, but he was
pretty active in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was just, I'm just always curious
as to about like what, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: had, did Rob tell you how long he'd been
working on skunk one when he gave it to
[SPEAKER_03]: you or any kind of like any info along
those lines?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that, you know, he worked in Ben
Loman, which is a little town up in the
[SPEAKER_02]: redwoods just above Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, you might go through Ben Loman,
for instance, if you're going to go up
[SPEAKER_02]: further up to like La Janda where Neil
Young lived, still a distance from San
[SPEAKER_02]: Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he told me that that's where he,
they had their little underground
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse going and, and, but he made it
sound like it, they had been doing it for
[SPEAKER_02]: a year or two before he never went into
the history of these other neighbors in
[SPEAKER_02]: Santa Cruz that Sam knew.
[SPEAKER_02]: That were the two brothers and all those
stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those I read more about later in,
on ICMAG and people disputing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one person saying, Oh no, it was this
and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, he, he, he mentioned though,
that he had been working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought his 1977 treatise, not from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where I found it,
but somewhere online.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when he came out with marijuana
botany, you know, everyone bought it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it wasn't for the growers guide,
Mel Franks, we would have failed because
[SPEAKER_02]: when we had that year, the second year
where we got this twist on the end of all
[SPEAKER_02]: of our plants and they were already six
foot, seven foot plants, we were like
[SPEAKER_02]: freaking out because they were supposed to
be getting flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead they had the leaves twisting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, he talked about micronutrients and
how you could have a, you could be short.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a couple of micronutrients in your
soil and that could make the world a
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got some concentrated seaweed
extract, which have 90 different minerals
[SPEAKER_02]: from the ocean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing that even comes close.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we bought a big backpack pump sprayer
filled with water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it held two gallons and just
walked around and sprayed the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we did it once and waited a
three or four days and then we did it
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but by the end of a week or eight or
nine days, they were all untwisting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever what they were missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was because of Mel Frank's book
about Mike talking about micronutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of zoned it down to being
malignant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lack of malignant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what's, what's amazing about
that to me is that many years later in
[SPEAKER_03]: 1993, when I was planning on growing for
the first time, two of the three books
[SPEAKER_03]: that taught me things was Rob Clark's
Marijuana Botany and Mel Frank's Grower's
[SPEAKER_03]: Guide.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there were different additions
by then, obviously they'd been through
[SPEAKER_03]: some revisions and things as time had gone
on, but the same knowledge to a young kid
[SPEAKER_03]: desperate for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That Grower's Guide, there was nothing
that even came close when it first came
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, it really was, really was
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine got so dog-eared.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put some like rings through it to hold
it together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I passed it on to, you know,
another, another guy that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: wound up growing and breeding and taking
seeds to dead concerts and stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: which was pretty, pretty foreign to me as
a, you know, skateboard punk rocker,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mel, it was, I think, I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was three people involved in that
book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mel Frank and Ed Rosenthal are the two I
remember off the top of my head,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there was a third author that was,
that contributed to it to some degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have the books at my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it Ang Lee?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he's, he's another photographer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's it right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That book, that book I've probably read a
hundred times in the six or eight months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I set up my first indoor,
because I had no idea what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, when you got it not so, it was
probably called the indoor outdoor
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana growers guide, but the original
one was just growers guide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growers guide.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I index my books so that I can go in there
and find whatever page I needed to really
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the marijuana growers guide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: More stuff, you know, five hour direct
light minimum.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's probably hard for young
people today to like conceive of just how
[SPEAKER_03]: sparse and hard to come by some of this
information was because they're used to
[SPEAKER_03]: the internet and typing things in and
forums and resources, but it was really
[SPEAKER_03]: limited back then in terms of what you
could access and, you know, and how to
[SPEAKER_03]: learn and so those books played.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously even with you guys, they played
a massive role in, in teaching people
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly how to pull off a successful crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first, first year it came out
in 1978.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first edition and or press in
Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_02]: And mine is kind of falling apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I understand what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look, what's one of my book markers in
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have at least two of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we used to, we used to go to the
library and I mean, I would search for
[SPEAKER_04]: everything on hydroponics because I even
growing outdoors, I was doing outdoor
[SPEAKER_04]: hydroponics and in 1981, you know,
five gallon buckets filled with peat moss,
[SPEAKER_04]: cow shit, perlite and vermiculite.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, fed with eco grow,
you know, granular or two part mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, so I went to the library and I
started, started researching hydroponics
[SPEAKER_04]: and basically I stole any good book from
the library that hydroponics and kept it,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it was very much self study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the book we are referring to the,
the Rob Clark thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the botany and ecology of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my copy that I scanned in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it loaded on the screen?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're numbered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine's actually not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the few that's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clark actually, one of the few times that
he's ever responded about anything was to
[SPEAKER_00]: give me the print run on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently there were, I think 1500
total.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a first print of 500 and a second
print of a thousand, but you can't tell
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are numbered, some are not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But another example, this is, he drew this
by hand and all through the book,
[SPEAKER_02]: this book are his drawings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just imagine him getting wasted and
just sitting and just digging drawing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could not draw that by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're, they're beautiful drawings in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and that's one of the things like
I've been sitting on it forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's not really out there
for people to see, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some of the most beautiful
drawings of cannabis and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: part, the parts of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did such an amazing job back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of, it kind of, you know,
it kind of reminds me of early,
[SPEAKER_04]: early botanists and explorers,
geneticists.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd travel around, you know,
different islands and stuff and
[SPEAKER_04]: discovering dodo birds and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sitting around drawing in their
sketchbooks, describing the fauna and
[SPEAKER_04]: flora of these, these exotic locations.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he got it so accurately.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just, they looked exactly right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The, the Indica plants that he,
he drew in marijuana botany were just spot
[SPEAKER_04]: on, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the elegant, the elegance of the
branches and the weaves that he drew,
[SPEAKER_04]: I just I always, I didn't know if he drew
them or somebody else did, but he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He drew them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just thought they were gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another book he did called Hans
that was released in Germany that has some
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful illustrations of his and,
but it's not available in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States, but if you guys can trace,
trace down a copy of Hans, which is German
[SPEAKER_00]: for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more beautiful drawings from him
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you zoom over to the Humboldt up here
on your list, the article that I found on
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt growing, I thought not the dog
would find this interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has, it has Rob Clark in the corner
here when he's 29 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holding a bud and it's in color,
but I only scan in black and white because
[SPEAKER_02]: I might, I'm running low on the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually I could have scanned it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't thinking about it, but I,
I met him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this article is from about 1982
because they mentioned something,
[SPEAKER_02]: the price of marijuana in 82.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, right up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 82, an estimated $1.8 billion a street
value.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was 29 in 82.
[SPEAKER_02]: If, so you can go backwards and figure
that out how old he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I met Rob, he came down to Negril
once with his wife at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was, we hung out together for a few
days in the grill and the concept was he
[SPEAKER_02]: was going to look for some, you know,
land races there, Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see him after those first few
days, but I think he traveled around a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is great because it talks about
the helicopters and in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the, one of the interesting things
about when helicopters first started
[SPEAKER_03]: flying is that people were growing all
these giant sativas and the Hills and
[SPEAKER_03]: Humboldt and Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nobody, as long as you were tucked
away, nobody cared how big they were.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause no one was looking for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's articles I've read where
like the very first gardens that got
[SPEAKER_03]: busted by helicopters, they actually
chopped down most of the gardens with
[SPEAKER_03]: chainsaws because the, the stocks were
like this, but they were so big and thick
[SPEAKER_03]: and the people weren't worried about,
about getting caught.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they just had these ginormous,
you know, these huge sativa plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gangster.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pushing a certain narrative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: That old chainsaw thing was, that's,
that was common down in where I was living
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the national guard helicopters
were flying, looking, looking for the
[SPEAKER_04]: crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, when we would go out,
when I went out to my gardens,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was always dressed in camouflage.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the, the whole, the whole
guerrilla mindset, leaving no trail.
[SPEAKER_04]: You would create a trail to your spot
where you would go from step to step,
[SPEAKER_04]: always putting your foot in exactly the
same spot that you did the time before,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, crawling under bushes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're probably familiar, Raho.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have, we have a bunch of manzanitas in
Mendocino County, which are for people
[SPEAKER_03]: that aren't familiar.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're kind of these like smooth limbed
bushes that get anywhere from six to 12
[SPEAKER_03]: feet tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can kind of thin them out
underneath.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people grew in manzanita
patches because you could still get some
[SPEAKER_03]: filtered light, but it wasn't going to be
totally exposed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So crawling around in manzanita patches
and, and cutting off lower branches to
[SPEAKER_03]: make spots for gardens is, is like my
first outdoor experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you holding up there right there,
sir?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you zoom in on this?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, these are humble photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: From that same article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me try to zoom in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he's holding up something on his
thing, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy to get back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it, Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some guys pruning their,
a father and son pruning some big leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: plants too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they both have 38 caliber weapons in
their back pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: That they point out in this article and
the guard dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then here's an aerial shot of a huge
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the chainsaw you're describing.
[SPEAKER_02]: People took that risk, but it didn't
always work once the helicopters came.
[SPEAKER_03]: The helicopters dramatically changed
people's approaches to a huge degree
[SPEAKER_03]: because most of these things were grown in
like, like, you know, I mean, that's super
[SPEAKER_03]: easily visible from the air, but like,
not from driving around.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the other color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: The color difference is just so obvious
from the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it did the tactics for hiding
this stuff became, you know, pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: creative.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are your humble chairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the garden that they just dismantled.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that Newsweek magazine,
um, Mad Jag, the, that came out that at
[SPEAKER_04]: the same time, there was another article I
can't remember if it was time or it was a
[SPEAKER_04]: national publication where they came out
with an article talking about this new
[SPEAKER_04]: high potency kind of super weed that was,
that was, you know, flooding the streets
[SPEAKER_04]: called skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been, I've been looking for this
magazine or this article ever since.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I honestly, I thought the reference
was in that Newsweek that had the guy with
[SPEAKER_04]: the mask and the, and the M16.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, it's, it wasn't, you know,
I've, I've read that article since,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I don't think there's a reference to
it, but they described the effects of
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk in that article.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's classic reefer madness,
you know, writing, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they, honestly, they got it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they, they described the appearance of
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They described the effects and,
uh, it was pretty spot on for what I
[SPEAKER_04]: thought skunk was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tears.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this one?
[SPEAKER_03]: A reason for tears.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, um, from the state of Utah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a, it's an entire reefer madness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, um, about, you know,
what's really bizarre is this high school
[SPEAKER_02]: undercover.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an article about guys who look at,
he's got a heavy metal t-shirt,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he's showing his badge and it's a
whole article about going undercover in
[SPEAKER_02]: the various high schools in Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 21 jump street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the TV show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'll tell you, this is obviously
so much later, but the first time that I
[SPEAKER_03]: ever saw a guy with waist long dreadlocks
tackle someone and then put cuffs on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on dead tour, I was like, Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, are these buds labeled in this
picture?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't read what they are, but they do
look labeled.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're labeled like Hawaiian Maui,
stickless tie, orange Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: They spell Colombian wrong too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They always spell it wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had some really good, um,
photos here of different things that they
[SPEAKER_02]: had confiscated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Hawkin red, Colombian red,
Guerrero gold.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always love those pictures, the
reference pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: From point of origin and time are so
valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so valuable, but it's hard when
it's cops, you know, taking the pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: and you got to hope that they got your
bag, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And got this, you kept the strain name
with it and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if it's your bag, you probably got
other things to worry about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Freaking provenance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, one thing, one thing that I think
is kind of interesting too, and it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's, it's obviously, we don't need to
dwell on it too much, but I do think that
[SPEAKER_03]: like, from what I'm listening to,
and you guys are talking about all these
[SPEAKER_03]: different Highland and lowland Colombians
and all these different regions and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that, and all these different
Mexicans and what they were.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of think that like the cocaine
trade and profitability with that sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: blocked off the next generation of
Americans from being able to experience
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the groups that were all bringing
in those Colombians and bringing in those
[SPEAKER_03]: Mexicans, they shifted to a more
profitable thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it also became unsafe for people,
a lot of times that looked like us to go
[SPEAKER_03]: down to those regions and get those
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was this era.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was two things that were happening at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the cocaine, you know, it became much
more profitable for the same people that
[SPEAKER_04]: used, you know, were formerly smuggling
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, the American,
you know, homegrown market had,
[SPEAKER_04]: had happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and that product was just such a
higher level of quality than what the
[SPEAKER_04]: imports had because of the freshness and,
you know, the introduction of
[SPEAKER_04]: hard-hitting, hard-hitting indicas in
their high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me what year do you think that was?
[SPEAKER_03]: 82, 83.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I mean, we don't need to sidetrack
on it, but there's been an interplay
[SPEAKER_03]: between like what Mexico and down south
does versus what's going on in America.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like each one responding to the other
in terms of.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cannabis that's been going on for,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a, that's not a sidetrack at
all.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a matter of fact, it's another Madjag
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we dive on into that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that the story about, you know,
how, you know, Madjag's contribution to
[SPEAKER_04]: the, to the, the, the, the Mexican
cannabis gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: My people's, you represent my people in
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did they, how did this start
happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: What era did the, the Mexico stuff start
occurring at Jag and how?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the last year I grew in Madjag
Canyon was 81.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by 82, I, I knew a guy who was a pilot
and it's not the pilot I wrote about like,
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, when we talked about 60
tons of Packy Hatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a guy I met him when I was working
a regular job at a truck loading place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked for Georgia Pacific for two years
in Phoenix in the late seventies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this guy, one day he walked up to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was loading his truck up with empty
plastic bottles, which is what they
[SPEAKER_02]: produce at Georgia Pacific.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, Hey, if, if, if I found a
whole bunch of weed out in the desert,
[SPEAKER_02]: could you sell it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had short hair too, but he just figured
he felt that vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I said, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, well, I was flying over this area
and I see where someone jettisoned one,
[SPEAKER_02]: an empty fuel canister and it's stuck in
the ground and I'm going to go out there
[SPEAKER_02]: and check it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's, they were smuggling
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went, sure, man, just let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he came back a week later and he was
all disappointed because it was just an
[SPEAKER_02]: empty fuel canister.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was actually air force that had
dropped it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was stuck in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like a bomb, you know,
it didn't explode, but then he started
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden, like two months
later, he comes back and I'm loading his
[SPEAKER_02]: truck and he says, um, I, I met the people
in Mexico and, and I said, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he's, he stole a twin engine Cessna
from Scottsdale airport, flew it to
[SPEAKER_02]: Guadalajara and gave it to the cartel to
prove to them that he was not a narc
[SPEAKER_00]: gangster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know later he stole a helicopter out
of Apache junction and flew it down,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he only got 20 miles into Mexico
before something went wrong mechanically
[SPEAKER_02]: and he had to crash land and hike his way
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the FBI came to his house because it
found his fingerprints in Mexico on this
[SPEAKER_02]: and he denied everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they couldn't do anything scared the
shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they, um, they brought several loads
up of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found an airstrip in along the Mogollon
rim in a small town area, way out by
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were like, within five minutes,
they said they would be there at one o
[SPEAKER_02]: 'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, they were at one Oh five
kicking out bales onto the air and they
[SPEAKER_02]: would, they would bring 500 kilos each
flight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where one of two of the flights
had labels already in them from someone
[SPEAKER_02]: who was supposed to get them in
California, but something went wrong and
[SPEAKER_02]: we got them instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still, I'm still hunting for those
labels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got them somewhere, but, um,
anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you had a connection with those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 82 and 83.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could see it from space.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a square couple miles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they show it in that TV show,
Narco Mexico.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, that's the name of the garden
or the farm El Bufalo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rancho Bufalo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And was this at the beginning of the,
the, um, Gallardo era of the development?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is when they were just doing weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happened was they, they grew
thousands and thousands of hectares of,
[SPEAKER_02]: of, uh, weed, but they didn't have anyone
growing seeds, seed crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they, they were desperate for seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my pilot friend, along with my
other friend, who was the weed dealer in
[SPEAKER_02]: Tempe, we filled two quart size bags half
full, and he stuck one in each of his
[SPEAKER_02]: cowboy boots.
[SPEAKER_02]: He flew to Alahar and gave it to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were so grateful because it,
they, they had no seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unfortunately I was part of this
because seeds from five different zones in
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexico ended up in their hands and became
the new hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, oh, well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you say unfortunately?
[SPEAKER_02]: In 1980s, Dutch genetics were already in
the grill of Jamaica and the people went
[SPEAKER_02]: wild over them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were growing them up in Orange Hill
and all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So land races were getting squeezed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, to find true Jamaican,
I don't think it's there anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably land races still in stash
spots and certainly in Columbia,
[SPEAKER_02]: but boy, Jamaica being a little island.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe you could clarify for a second
then those seeds that you brought down or
[SPEAKER_03]: he brought down smuggled in his boots.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were they a mix of?
[SPEAKER_02]: They were a mix of Guerrero, Sinalone,
Michoacan, Oaxacan that my dealer friend
[SPEAKER_02]: in Tempe had high graded over the course
of like two or three years.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best of the loads that had passed
through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's why you were like,
oh, you were a little bummed about it
[SPEAKER_03]: because you kind of mixed the strains and
then they started growing in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then instead of it being like a
regional thing where these specific kinds
[SPEAKER_03]: were coming from, it was sort of a blend
coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: El Buffalo got discovered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I wrote down this November 14th of 84
is when they found it and burned it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually, the smoke affected people
within a hundred mile radius, 500
[SPEAKER_02]: hectares.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they estimate that it was worth $2.5
billion at that time in 84.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a famous scene in Narcos where
he, uh, I can't, I think it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was Guerrero's brother, Raph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that his brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces in the, in the, in the series,
like this is the super, the super strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the Cinza Mia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was this before or after you met him that,
or is this the, the hybrid that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we gave them seeds in 82 and 83 and
El Buffalo was captured and burned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it ran for years before
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just in general, they, Quintero was
growing weed in other places, but Buffalo
[SPEAKER_02]: was like their huge place.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had their own wells drilled there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was in Sinaloa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I've, I've read about it in a book
called the underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like 900 pages long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, um, written by a DEA agent who
is in charge of all the stuff going on
[SPEAKER_02]: then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has three chapters, one on heroin.
[SPEAKER_02]: One on cocaine and one on weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one on weeds about El Buffalo
being spotted by a TWA pilot or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're flying over and they went,
what in the world?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just mentioned it casually.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where Kiki Camarena got a job and
went and actually penetrated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the second movie of Sicario,
so popular, it's kind of similar because
[SPEAKER_02]: he's dressed up as a campesino and he gets
a job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Kiki is the, is the that's the,
that's the name of the DEA agent that got
[SPEAKER_03]: killed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kiki Camarena.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that caused a huge amount of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just left it alone, you know,
but they didn't, um, and that's when they
[SPEAKER_02]: were switching over to cocaine just about
then, 84, 85.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that being burned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quintero, um, from what I read just became
an addict of, you know, drug addict of
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cause he was, he was sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't want to see them go into
cocaine, but Rafael, um, Miguel Angel
[SPEAKER_02]: Felix Gallardo, he went ahead and went,
you know, he became, he formed the first
[SPEAKER_02]: cartel with all these loose plazas that
were existing guys over here and guys over
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I stayed at his hotel in 84,
one of his many, he owned apparently a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my friend who was the pilot,
we went down there and my friend from
[SPEAKER_02]: Columbia found his way there from Columbia
and we all had a big party and they were
[SPEAKER_02]: hoping that my friend from Columbia would
be able to turn them on to newer
[SPEAKER_02]: connections and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know really what happened because
he loved to do coke, but he and I both
[SPEAKER_02]: decided we didn't want to be in that
business.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the pilot, this guy, he, he kept
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were using our airstrip, the one that
we had found from weed, 1600 to 2000
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds of coke at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did nine loads and then they,
an off duty sheriff who was cutting wood
[SPEAKER_02]: saw them landing and unloading and they
got busted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I have no idea what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a clip I've, I've posted before,
I think on ICMAG, but I never met,
[SPEAKER_02]: I never met Miguel Felix, but,
um, my partners did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did enjoy his hospitality because we
went in this hotel room and there was a,
[SPEAKER_02]: just like in the movies, a plate with a
four ounce pile of cocaine on it and two
[SPEAKER_02]: other guys who did nothing, but just bring
cases of beer all through the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice of them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like a weekend at not so his place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except, except there's a lot more men,
a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt loves that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If he doesn't at least once a show,
try to throw me off my game with something
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's upset.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, you know, he found his opening and
he took it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: She said, but I mean, just, just,
you know, raho to that, that, that whole
[SPEAKER_03]: thing is just crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I, when I was, when I was
starting to do gorilla in California,
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the things that the Mexicans did
was that even with the cocaine,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was told that like still 70% of their
profits was marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they really didn't like,
um, all this homegrown in the West coast,
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of taking their, taking their,
you know, their, their sales really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they started sending these teams
all from down by where Matt is all the way
[SPEAKER_03]: up to the Oregon border and going in the
national forest and just growing a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: amount, as much as they could get away
with in all the national forests.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way they didn't have to smuggle it
over the border.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and that's, that was kind of,
so there's been this, obviously this,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, that's what I was saying before
about like how one, one country influences
[SPEAKER_03]: the other is the homegrown movement has
dramatically changed how the, how the
[SPEAKER_03]: Mexicans approach growing weed,
because, you know, for a long time,
[SPEAKER_03]: they were sort of the primary weed people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially in Arizona with the border.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, um, Tucson was like the capital of
smugglers and, and dealers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it moved up to Phoenix and Tempe
and Scottsdale, but they, they busted a
[SPEAKER_02]: big grow in the Canyon next to us just 10,
15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a gang from, from Mexico
operating out of Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had a spring that they had found
up on the side of this mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had a system of drip irrigation
that ran a mile down.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just went too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys, they just didn't even think
about hunters and ranchers and they just
[SPEAKER_02]: threw a team at it, group, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they all got busted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blew it out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, to some degree on a spring on a
hillside model.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's the way it was done in
NorCal when I was out there that summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you've seen lots of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the, I think the cartels kind of
had a, a, they've viewed a lot of their
[SPEAKER_03]: workers as semi-disposable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they sort of expected a certain
amount to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just threw a lot of people out
there in a lot of different regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they figured most of them will be
successful and some of them won't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of how they went about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think just a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they had money, but you know,
when the, when the powder came in,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I think a lot of that Colombian,
uh, import just disappeared entirely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Mexican commercial.
[SPEAKER_04]: They probably filled the gap for that,
for that tier of product quality around
[SPEAKER_04]: the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you that, um, you know,
I mean, I started smoking in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was Brown Mexican and Green Mexican.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see Thai.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see Colombian.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see Panamanian.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see any of those, of those famous
things that people wax poetic about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Mexican.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been decade later and all I saw
was Mexican too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just never, I never saw a
tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never saw anything other than just
Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a little bit into Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, just a hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to go more into that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there some more details you want to add
in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just rubbing shoulders with these
famous people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know who they were at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just, um, guys exporting weed
from Guadalajara area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when we found out it was Miguel
Angel, um, and we were like, Whoa,
[SPEAKER_02]: shit, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, I'm so glad we didn't get sucked into
the cocaine deal because the, this guy
[SPEAKER_02]: who, who was a truck driver, he could fly
helicopters.
[SPEAKER_02]: He could fly planes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, he went that direction and sold 10
kilos to an undercover agent North of
[SPEAKER_02]: Phoenix in the biggest hand to hand sale
buy in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Arizona history at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he got, I think it was seven kilos and
he got 10 years in prison, but his brother
[SPEAKER_02]: kept going and did those loads on our air,
our air strip that we found.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and they got nine of them before they
got busted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we calculated at the price of Coke at
the time that it was, it came to around a
[SPEAKER_02]: quarter billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, $250 million of Coke that they
successfully brought in before they got
[SPEAKER_02]: busted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have no idea what happened to those
boys.
Boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reselda Blanco.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never heard her name until I read
about it in newsweek or time, but that's
[SPEAKER_02]: who my Colombian friend was actually
working for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his job was to count money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he would go to Aspen where they bring
in DC nines or something like six tons at
[SPEAKER_02]: a time of Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he would just, his fingers,
he could barely move them after a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they didn't have machines yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then she's, I can imagine hand counting $5
million, you know, in 20s and tens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that's where the stories started
happening about how they weighed their,
[SPEAKER_02]: their money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in Florida, he went to a apartment
building once and he said, there'd be like
[SPEAKER_02]: five apartments and they'd have a secret
door in the closet that would link it to
[SPEAKER_02]: the next apartment and to the next
apartment so that if they had to bail,
[SPEAKER_02]: they could just disappear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he went into one apartment and he said
it was Florida ceiling with tiny
[SPEAKER_02]: passageways in the hallways of just money
piled Florida ceiling, every single room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said there was millions of millions
of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and that was one of the kinds of
places where they would just weigh money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, you know, and then send it back to
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ability of being the dude who has to
count it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like you get that shit wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be the first person they
look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not me.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Jamaican friends in Brooklyn,
the guy who was in charge, he goes by the
[SPEAKER_02]: nickname Sata.
[SPEAKER_02]: He overpaid us once $2,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know him and he did it as a trick to
see if we were going to tell him and be
[SPEAKER_02]: honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: We counted the money a second time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, in his house in Brownsville.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, you know, Sata you're over by
$2,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, not even possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was just messing with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he wanted us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were, it was early in our relationship
and he wanted to see if we were honest
[SPEAKER_02]: enough and we passed, we passed the test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do that with my spray,
like my reversal spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd give it to different people and,
you know, give them different like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, you know, for this exchange or this
exchange and knowing mostly that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: never going to get anything, but just to
kind of get a good gauge of who is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to just take it, run with it, use it to
make themselves a bunch of money or who
[SPEAKER_00]: would do, you know, what they said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, it's a small loss,
but it's a good way to judge a potential
[SPEAKER_00]: future lifelong friend too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheap way to, to figure out who you can
trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to them and to the other person,
it's almost like from a greedy person's
[SPEAKER_00]: angle, it's like, well, this one bottle
could potentially make me, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: several thousand dollars worth of feminine
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it worth the burn?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and a lot of times it is worth
the burn to people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Magic magic always says, if there is a
doubt about a person, then there is no
[SPEAKER_04]: doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good quote.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a line from the movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ronan and Ronan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says, if there's a doubt,
there is no doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's near the end of the movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when you find out that he never
quit and he was still working for the CIA
[SPEAKER_02]: or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Robert De Niro classical movie,
but it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you, I treat my life that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have a doubt about something,
I just go, I'll wait and see what the
[SPEAKER_02]: universe does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I didn't do that when I was younger,
both feet, you know, you seem to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: very magical touched life though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of people, you know,
only live a fraction or see a fraction of
[SPEAKER_00]: what, what you managed to get yourself
wound up in time to time again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and the fact is you guys weren't
outlaws as far as carrying guns and being
[SPEAKER_00]: cowboys and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You carried this very humble attitude.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a great big throwing knife on my hip
when I was doing the canyon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I don't know what good that
would do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but we, we specifically didn't,
we knew other people, some of the guys
[SPEAKER_02]: from Jerome, they are all heavily armed
and they would have barbed wire in the
[SPEAKER_02]: bushes and weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You read about this in magazines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just going, that's, that makes
them instantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, dangerous criminals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just hippies, dangerous criminals.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an important distinction to make
because I think, uh, we've chatted for
[SPEAKER_03]: long enough now that I can safely say that
everybody on, on this, uh, this little,
[SPEAKER_03]: this little call that we're doing is,
is a weed nerd, you know, in that regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for me, um, having been in a bunch
of counterculture kind of my whole life,
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally differentiate between like
people who do certain substances,
[SPEAKER_03]: but are otherwise like honorable and very
good people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just some of the things they decided
to get into happened to not be societally
[SPEAKER_03]: acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then people that are like actual
criminals, you know, where it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's a big difference there because
there's a lot of people that are wonderful
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and the only thing that they do wrong,
really, they could get them into
[SPEAKER_03]: significant trouble is marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I, and I was, when I was
listening to you guys talk about some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the, the, the transition into powders and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that I've always thought
about is that like the weed game or the
[SPEAKER_03]: weed scene is inherently just like less
dangerous than that other world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when that other world started
happening, maybe it's because of the way
[SPEAKER_03]: it makes people think or the way people
act or the money was so much bigger,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it seemed to bring out a lot of like
negative qualities in people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That when you were in the weed game
existed, but maybe weren't like,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe weren't like accented quite so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my friends in Brooklyn, they would
open the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd have a Mac nine in his hand,
you know, and he'd look around and make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure it was cool to let us in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they had, they had plenty of weapons,
but my friend Ricky, who he's still my
[SPEAKER_02]: friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see him when I go to New York,
he lives in Brooklyn in the same
[SPEAKER_02]: apartment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since 74, he never, ever had a gun.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other Rastas did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but he was, he's a philosopher.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a real gentle guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a good brother of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've known him 40 years now, and he,
he's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go have curry goat with him whenever
we're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He takes me to a different restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love curry goat and Ackee and salt fish.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have in those, those Caribbean
neighborhoods, you know, you can still get
[SPEAKER_02]: all that the restaurants they cater to the
people that live there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say too, like for Mendocino
County, there's definitely people that
[SPEAKER_03]: have guns that had the intention on using
them, you know, if they were accosted by
[SPEAKER_03]: other humans, but there was a lot of
growers that had guns on them simply
[SPEAKER_03]: because they were in some remote ass spot
on the hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they came across a bear with cubs
or a mountain lion, they didn't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: just die.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted to have a fighting chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was, there was this idea of I'm
alone in the deep woods by myself,
[SPEAKER_03]: and this is not my territory.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's bear and mountain lion and
other things that, that, uh, I'm a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: weaker than even Jaguars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jaguars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even that, I mean, mountain lions,
this, you know, bears usually here,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, mountain lions, they, they've been
watching you for a while, if you ever even
[SPEAKER_03]: know that they're there, you know,
um, but we would encounter all that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a lot of times all of a sudden,
something would go wrong with our water
[SPEAKER_03]: and we'd have to walk the water line back
to like the, the cat, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the, the spring box that we had made or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're walking through deep woods,
totally alone, you know, and you're in the
[SPEAKER_03]: deep woods and you know, you don't have
teeth or claws and you're not super
[SPEAKER_03]: strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some people would have pissed their
pistols or shotguns or something just to
[SPEAKER_03]: make themselves feel okay when they're out
there and sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dual Dobermans is, is popular with some
people I knew.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had two Dobermans and they were,
you know, they went wherever they went,
[SPEAKER_02]: they had their Dobermans and one's name
was Tor and the other one was Tia,
[SPEAKER_02]: Tortilla.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this one guy and you know,
they, they were not quite command dogs,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they were close.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would tell them to do something and
they would just do it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and they'd sniff out a bear or a bear
would, you know, better let your dogs
[SPEAKER_02]: fight the bear than you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in my era too, it became
uncomfortable because, um, the penalty for
[SPEAKER_03]: getting caught with a gun at a,
at a, at a row was actually like quite a
[SPEAKER_03]: bit worse than the grow itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then it was kind of like a,
uh, do you risk it even because even if,
[SPEAKER_03]: even if you were going to beat the case on
a medical thing or something like that
[SPEAKER_03]: later on with the grow, they'd be like,
Oh no, he's a hardened criminal armed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was ready to hurt people and we taught
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this is from that Humboldt
article and they're, they're pointing out
[SPEAKER_02]: this machine gun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says Humboldt deputies sees this
menacing array of weaponry, including an
[SPEAKER_02]: Uzi and an AK-47 along with marijuana in
raids on growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they love to point those out and
make everybody think that that's what most
[SPEAKER_02]: growers are doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people, sadly, I mean,
when wherever there's profit involved,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, people get into it for different
reasons, you know, and, and some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: people involved certainly were that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't classify it as the majority,
but certainly a percentage, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: humans are humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't feel real comfortable in
Guadalajara to tell you the truth because
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone was packing in those,
the guys carrying the beer were packing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just they, that's their job.
[SPEAKER_02]: They took us out to sushi in Guadalajara
and it was some of the best sushi I've
[SPEAKER_02]: ever had in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, um, they were, it was a
lieutenant of Miguel's.
[SPEAKER_02]: He went by the name of Wapo, which means
handsome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they took us out and it was amazing
because the guy who ran it, he'd speak in
[SPEAKER_02]: Japanese to his crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then he turned to us and speak in English
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he turned and talked to these
guys in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was quite, quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't, doesn't fit in with the
stereotype of the dumb, of the dumb
[SPEAKER_04]: stoner, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I mean, I think Americans are,
uh, we're very, we're very isolated
[SPEAKER_03]: because we've got Canadians who also speak
English for the most part, besides the
[SPEAKER_03]: people in Quebec, uh, above us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and we've got two oceans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think a lot of parts of the world
are multilingual just because they
[SPEAKER_03]: encounter so many different languages as
part of their daily life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in America, we are, we're kind of
broken from that in a bit, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: my Swiss friend that speaks five languages
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an aunt who's Swiss and she speaks
four and so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, very much so.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I actually kind of regret that
because I think the lung, the younger you
[SPEAKER_03]: learn language, the more fluent and fluid
you are in, in speaking and reading it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I think Americans, a lot of times,
like, uh, it does something to your brain
[SPEAKER_03]: to be able to speak multiple languages and
communicate, you know, I think it's super
[SPEAKER_03]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we have the, the story of the
peyote Prince.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you briefly or maybe not even briefly,
can you tell us what a peyote Prince is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, one of, they're, they're both,
I don't know how they came into this,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they both knew Sam and Sam was a road
chief in the native American church on the
[SPEAKER_02]: Navajo reservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had a license that allowed him to
go to Northern Mexico across the border
[SPEAKER_02]: from Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'd come back with a quarter million
or a half a million of peyote buttons for
[SPEAKER_02]: the church where actually 90% of it wasn't
going to the church.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was going to these two guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would, one lived in Tempe,
two blocks from the police station.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one lived in Cottonwood,
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, that's where I lived at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these were fresh buttons.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had to dry them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the guy in Tempe had date, date racks
that they dry dates in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was perfect for peyote.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you went into his little old house
in Tempe, you had to turn sideways to go
[SPEAKER_02]: down the hallways or go into any room.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, that wasn't the stacks of
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just stacks of date trays drying
200,000 buttons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once they dry, as you've, if you've
seen them, they look like little flat
[SPEAKER_02]: disks and almost like jerky, you know,
like a little piece of jerky, but don't be
[SPEAKER_02]: fooled by until you take them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would just sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was 1973 when I was first in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you could get them as low as a
nickel a button.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you bought a certain amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you could sell them for a
quarter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in Illinois, in cargo, all over the
United States, these two guys had friends
[SPEAKER_02]: who, who would come to Arizona and get
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they shipped in UPS or in
the mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: People always took them.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my friends gave a guy 200 and he
was going through custom or through the
[SPEAKER_02]: gate to go to his air, his flight.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was about 1980.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking in Phoenix or maybe it was 78
somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he looked back to see his friend
leaving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the security guys was holding
the bag of peyote up in the air and
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and he asked him, what are
these?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, they're peyote, they're,
um, cactus seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy went, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he gave it back to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they didn't even have, it wasn't
even in their radar and their training
[SPEAKER_02]: yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the princes were amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I know both of them still,
they're still both alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them isn't as healthy as the
other, but they were, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was just a.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing thing that millions and millions
of buttons they sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them were diverted to Redway
to the guy there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two of my friends would drive 50 to 70,000
buttons to up to Northern California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would get turned into mescal and
sulfate pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And mescal is only like 40%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some number like that of the,
of the alkaloids in a peyote.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one that everyone knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they even call it mescaline,
you know, or whatever, but there's many
[SPEAKER_02]: other alkaloids that are significant in a
peyote journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you extract just the mescal and
sulfate, then it's a different journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did them both.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I compared it to the mescal and
sulfate was like peyote without the
[SPEAKER_02]: teacher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you take peyote or experience
it, there's this inner voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's, it's hard to describe,
but you, it seems like it's someone else,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's you actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your inner consciousness.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're hearing your thoughts in a way that
it sounds like it's an external voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done peyote.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, I'm terrified of throwing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let me, let me interject something
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: My, um, my experience with peyote is
probably a lot less than yours,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I will say that the buttons were some
of the more bitter things that I ever
[SPEAKER_03]: intentionally swallowed in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I can see how the mescaline pills
might, might go down a little smoother for
[SPEAKER_03]: some people because you really have to be
like, okay, this is going to be good for
[SPEAKER_03]: me because they don't taste good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as bitter as wormwood,
but it's right up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty intense, bitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I remember that was, that's my
strongest memory of trying to consume them
[SPEAKER_03]: was like, man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, there was people doing peyote
animals to avoid it going into their gut.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was big in the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly a couple of ladies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they would make tea and then just do
an animal and then you would have this
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderful trip and you never throw up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get any discontent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Comfort because you skipped your gut,
your stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like I've, I've, I've done,
uh, ayahuasca in Brazil booths all the
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good Lord.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not, but when you, when you are like,
you know, meeting your creator or whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're, and you're super fired up,
um, having your stomach hurt and having to
[SPEAKER_03]: purge any, which way you have to purge is
pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember when I did it in Brazil,
I had to run out and I had to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to get rid of some things out
outside of myself in the jungle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really wanted a bright American
clean bathroom because I felt so exposed,
[SPEAKER_03]: just like running in the dark and,
and, uh, experience of other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: South America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very intense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, peyote, it doesn't,
it doesn't feel good digesting some of
[SPEAKER_03]: those alkaloids you were discussing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your body is not ready to digest them
comfortably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes chocolate mescaline and the
stuff that was being sold on the Hill and
[SPEAKER_02]: Boulder was not mescaline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, even at that low price of five or six
or eight cents a button, when this was
[SPEAKER_02]: being made by that, that, um, wizard
chemist in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_02]: it, it enough to get you high would cost
you $10.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these one and $2 hits of chocolate
mescaline were just, um, LSD mixed in
[SPEAKER_02]: because unless you paid her 10,
$15 photos on my, um, one of my,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, Chronicles, they look like pickup
sticks about an inch long, sharp needles.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you poured them out of a bottle,
they would just pile up in these sharp
[SPEAKER_02]: needle looks, and they'd have to be
crushed into a powder to put them in a
[SPEAKER_02]: cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, um, just, ate some of the crystals
once.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but the guy who said, you know,
if you're measuring this out, a good trip,
[SPEAKER_02]: it'd be 10 to $15.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very few people have actually even seen
or done mescaline sulfate.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would even say in my era when I was
experimenting with that stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's almost all relabeled LSD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, it just was, uh,
it, most people haven't experienced it
[SPEAKER_03]: because the pay, the buttons are hard to
come by and the case gross, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and people are just marketing to a
different thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're like, oh yeah, here's some
mescaline, but it, um, yeah, some really
[SPEAKER_00]: good advice you gave in one of your
stories, uh, Jack about juicing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but can you talk about that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the last time I did peyote,
I juiced 15 buttons, fresh buttons,
[SPEAKER_02]: and yes, 10 is you eat 10 fresh buttons.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could get those down, you will have
a really strong journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took 50 and juice them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a quart bottle of beautiful
emerald green liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my friend who was the tall fellow,
my first grow partner, he drank a third of
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottle and I drank two thirds of the
bottle and he spent the whole night face
[SPEAKER_02]: down on his sleeping bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he never moved for like 10 hours and I
would ask him a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he wouldn't answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then about three or four minutes
later, he'd go, no, it was a time lag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a fire going and I was saying,
let's go for a hike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just, he was immobilized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but he had a good, when he woke up in
the morning, he said, uh, I had the
[SPEAKER_02]: strangest dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he did enjoy it though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the, the movie young guns with Emilio
Estevez and all those young kids stars
[SPEAKER_02]: that were, there's a scene in there where
they eat peyote and they're the one guy
[SPEAKER_02]: shooting his gun wildly out at this mining
claim.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and the what other guys talking and
you hear his voice, but he's not talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whoever produced that movie has done
peyote because they knew about the voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so clear in that scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just amazed that someone had,
um, or they had a technical advisor that
[SPEAKER_02]: knew that that's how they would do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he was stumbling around and he could
hear this voice talking to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, Matt has tried to get me to talk about
psychedelics on the show and I've kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: kept it weed focused, but I will say that
sometimes when, when things get very
[SPEAKER_03]: intense, um, you're kind of locked in your
own mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if your friend was laying down what
they're experiencing and feeling and
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking and is so intense, you just lose
track of the fact that you have legs and
[SPEAKER_03]: arms and you can't really interact with
the world because you have so much sensory
[SPEAKER_03]: data that's coming into your brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're thinking about so many things
that like all that other stuff is
[SPEAKER_03]: extraneous to some degree, you know,
and that that's common.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen that on mushrooms, on LSD,
on high doses of different things where
[SPEAKER_03]: you just end up kind of in your own head,
you know, it's not a very physical thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very inward thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and so, um, sometimes that's
good and sometimes that's bad,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it usually is, is, is, is positive
long-term, you know, as long as you got a
[SPEAKER_03]: safe space and you're with friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Set and setting is everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, I think for a episode three,
we might adventure, maybe if you're open
[SPEAKER_00]: to it, maybe make that more of the,
um, full expansive psychological
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic aspect of your life,
the spiritual journey that, that has
[SPEAKER_00]: brought Mad Jag to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we're, we're buttoned up against the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know like, for those who are
watching this, we recorded this around,
[SPEAKER_00]: right around Christmas time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's kind of squeezing in hours to
get them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also wanted to, to really thank you
guys for spending your time with us and
[SPEAKER_00]: every, everyone in the audience on,
on Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah, it's an honor, man,
and a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm so glad that we, um, I was able to
convince Raho to, um, join in the way he
[SPEAKER_02]: has, because, uh, I met him for the first
time last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been, we've been face to face,
but we've been friends for, since around
[SPEAKER_02]: 2012 on the forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it was just a gas to meet him
and, oh, I bet I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to see him sit with people talking
about strains and, and varieties,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was only one other person,
a guy who goes by the name Satva who's in
[SPEAKER_02]: Boulder, who's can tell you about 30
different types of Columbian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's been growing Columbian in Boulder
for like 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 10 different Punta Roja strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, he, and he goes to these
places.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's he, his wife speaks fluent Spanish.
[SPEAKER_02]: He speaks some, and they go down to
Guerrero a lot along the coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: In little towns that you can only get to
by boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's posted some photos and yeah,
he's, he was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can say from my perspective that first
Matt will tell you it takes a lot to shut
[SPEAKER_03]: me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I try to talk as little as
possible, but I burn with questions almost
[SPEAKER_03]: every third sentence that you or Raho talk
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I try to afterwards write down various
questions and ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ideas that I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's really cool that we're having
like this multi-stage thing, because an
[SPEAKER_03]: hour or two after we do these things,
I get, I'm like, Oh my God, why didn't I
[SPEAKER_03]: follow up on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: So bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to remember, you know, because
there's this off-handed comment and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, conversations go in different
directions and you don't always get to
[SPEAKER_03]: follow up on stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and we like free flowing, but,
um, there's a wealth, there's a wealth of,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, of, of information.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just enjoyable convo here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm, I'm super stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, remember this for next time,
pay phones and quarters, pay phones and
[SPEAKER_02]: quarters and quarters because that's how
we had to communicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd call my family.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my, that was my, if we ever talk
about the psychedelic aspect, that was my
[SPEAKER_03]: era of pay phones and quarters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what a chinger is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a black box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's to make it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we did when we were on dead tour
is we, someone discovered that when you
[SPEAKER_03]: put quarters into a pay phone,
the pay, the pay, the company actually
[SPEAKER_03]: knows what coin you're putting in by the
tone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a dime is one tone and nickel is one
tone.
[SPEAKER_03]: A quarter is one tone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody got the clever idea that you
could get these little recorders from
[SPEAKER_03]: radio shack that recorded about 30 seconds
and you could record them and you could
[SPEAKER_03]: just push in quarters into the thing and
record.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you go to make a long
distance call, you know, you, we would,
[SPEAKER_03]: so we would use pay phones and,
and, and all these different things and
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, tell each other where
we're going to be at what time of day and
[SPEAKER_03]: what hour and call us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as a boomer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He calls them chingers, us, us,
us young and call them black boxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You hold it up to the mouthpiece of the
phone and hit play.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would make the sound of the coins
falling into the machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And eventually, eventually the phone
company caught onto it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you would get an operator going,
sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you would have to bail.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, you know, yeah, it, uh,
that was, that was before cell phones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when pay phones were everywhere,
$9 and 90 cents for three minutes to Cali,
[SPEAKER_02]: Columbia from in 1982.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the operators were going, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I, yeah, it was,
I used a lot of quarters, but my friend in
[SPEAKER_02]: Manhattan, one of the three brothers of
the weed people, he would buy a thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars worth at a time at a bank and he
had a cart and he'd bring them out and
[SPEAKER_02]: load up his car.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whenever he'd go out, he just put like
10 rolls in his pockets because you never
[SPEAKER_02]: know how many phone calls you're going to
have to make and how long, cause he was
[SPEAKER_02]: always calling to different States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, pay phones.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it was a little spy versus spy on that
level.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were safer, you know, they were
safer, especially if you rotated and
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't use the same ones all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Following not so though, after a pay
phone, because they're just so sticky.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just cannot deal with that man.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, he's got two in this episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't get one last time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's bombed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really practically three with the
whole boofing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad someone remembered that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're at almost two hours here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Matt, if you want to plug anything and,
um, and we'll keep, we'll keep this thing
[SPEAKER_03]: going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a lot of paths we can go
down and, uh, we still only scratch the
[SPEAKER_03]: surface on some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we, we made it to map one 1979.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, yeah, next round, we're going
to go to 1980 map and then continue on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, we have our merch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check out syndicate gear.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you guys, Raho anything?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you know, this was a great episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like, we kind of focused on,
uh, mad Jag stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, if we, maybe we can
organize or, you know, get a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: a game plan to limit or focus discussions
that way we won't spin off so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be able to drill down, um,
on the upcoming ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, now, you know, maybe with all
this discussion about old Mexicans,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd maybe give a shout out to one of my
boys, cryptic labs, who has a great
[SPEAKER_04]: reputation for his a walk in lines that
these are stuff that he's collected back
[SPEAKER_04]: in the eighties and has preserved and
shared and, and, uh, is turning out great
[SPEAKER_04]: lines today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, he's just done a kind of a dug out a
fresh batch of old seeds and has done a
[SPEAKER_04]: selection on them and has found a couple
of amazing phenos that I think he'll be
[SPEAKER_04]: coming out with soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cryptic labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the old max.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But besides that, just looking forward to
more and some of my own stuff to throw in
[SPEAKER_04]: there.

thing to Zomia collective out of Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have some amazing old land race ties,
um, the squirrel tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the red string tie, the dining or I
don't want to mispronounce it anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, they ship very fast and I got
myself, which is not always easy when,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sending money out of the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So props to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: People looking for land race stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a legit place.
