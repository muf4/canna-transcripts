[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_00]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Notzodot, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to record a short here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions I get asked the most
often is, what is blue bonnet?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to talk about blue bonnet, I have to go
back quite a few years before to when I
[SPEAKER_00]: was in San Diego and I was working at a
collective called BCC as their grower
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever bud would come in and it had
seeds, I always told the owner to let me
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So someone brought in some bud and I
looked at it and smelled it and it smelled
[SPEAKER_00]: like sweet peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super frosty, had seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, hey, I'm going to,
you know, make some of these seeds out and
[SPEAKER_00]: what did they bring this in as?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, well, we have it labeled
strawberry cough, but he brought it in as
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember putting that in the back of
my head thinking that there's no way this
[SPEAKER_00]: is blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, this is peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, cut to a few months later,
I'm going through my stuff and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, maybe I'll pop some of those peanut
buttery seeds, see what comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pop a bunch of them and out comes in
one of them, the most beautiful purple
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry smelling plant I'd ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I refer to as the riot berry
from then on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked this line for several
generations, sold every single seed I had
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It bred true for purple traits and the
blueberry, it was like blueberry jam,
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry compote turps, but the problem
was is the resin production was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: low and the potency wasn't really
recreationally viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if people were smoking it for
nerve pain and stuff, it was, it was
[SPEAKER_00]: killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the only thing that helped like a
tooth abscess for me back in the day when
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had great pain relieving qualities,
but it just was pretty worthless for
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut to several years later, I lose my
clone that I've selected from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lose everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sell everything, you know, it just,
it, it occurs that I end up with nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: but the BX1 seeds left and the BX1 seeds,
unfortunately, weren't a success in the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that I would have liked them to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something's a BX1, I'm usually back
crossing for a specific trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal in that was to back cross just
for the blueberry and, and yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: the blueberry traits and the purple,
but it didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a lot of different berries in
there in the BX1, but you can't,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's a hit or miss on the berry and
it should have been, it should have been
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I chose to out cross was not
ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided, you know what, like I have a
massive blueberry collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've collected blueberry over all the
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even while it was working the right berry
stuff, I was still collecting every
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry line I saw, buying every
blueberry line I saw, no matter how old or
[SPEAKER_00]: from when or from where I bought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided to run a bunch of these to
look for a good blueberry breeding female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I ended up finding was the most
amazing breeding male that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: encountered in my whole career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I genuinely think right now, looking back,
pre me using the blue bonnet, like I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think anything came close to what was
achieved with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now blue bonnet itself, I had heard about
while I was doing my right berry projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasn't really paying much attention
to what was going on with other people's
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry, you know, because I was like,
my shit's the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck do I need another blueberry
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever, you know, like I had blue clones
come by, like the Dabney Blue,
[SPEAKER_00]: different DJ short blueberry selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, no, blue bonnet, blue bonnet,
I had just heard all this stuff about that
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a great blueberry muffin strain,
you know, for those turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was pretty true for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kept that in my memory bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, when I went to go pop seed,
Bodie passed it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it was made by Lone Star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lone Star is no longer with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: He owned Texas Resin Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original name for it was the Texas
Super Blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it later became blue bonnet because,
you know, he's from Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the state flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a beautiful flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's I guess that's where he
was going with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I could find from him talking about
it, he said that he had gotten an already
[SPEAKER_00]: worked line of DJ shorts blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So someone had taken DJ shorts work,
worked it, and then Lone Star worked it
[SPEAKER_00]: further.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't really see how many generations
was in between there and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so it's supposed to be a pure DJ
blueberry selected for those traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, however, after crossing it to
many things, running out every single line
[SPEAKER_00]: that we crossed it to, I am fully
convinced that this blue bonnet plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: it's either an anomaly of all all
blueberry that exists or it was outcrossed
[SPEAKER_00]: at some point to something very potent and
very resinous and somehow still true
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding for the blueberry turfs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have a lot of mutations that
blueberry passes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it were just a worked on outcrossed
blueberry several generations in past DJs,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be more inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd see a lot more of the nasty
recesses pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't see any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breeds true for potency, for high
terpene content like the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blueberry turps are very, very
dominant in almost everything it crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: to except for super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, super skunk stuff is is
is resistant to it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that said, everything I crossed it to
that had super skunk and it did show some
[SPEAKER_00]: modicum of berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just almost all the other lines,
you'd find only berry phenos in them,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it was an outcrossed, you know,
something else like like our cherry AK
[SPEAKER_00]: blue bonnet, you could find only blueberry
phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that that's the the short history
on the blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be a worked DJ line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a worked outcrossed and
worked further, which actually means that
[SPEAKER_00]: they did more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're even intimating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took more talent than they're
intimating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an odd situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure if it's just just that
one anomaly that happens to be the sport
[SPEAKER_00]: that breeds true for all these traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't breed true for any of the
inbred traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I did find was the best male
cannabis plant that I have ever worked
[SPEAKER_00]: with in my life was incredibly true
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could easily predict how each plant,
each plant that I was familiar with as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as the clone mothers that I was crossing
it to, I could easily predict what the
[SPEAKER_00]: outcomes would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost always knew visually everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was it was pretty uncanny.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that I didn't I didn't predict
would be probably one of the best in the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole thing was a banana punch cut I had
that skunk tech selected from symbiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was banana OG purple punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like a grape now a later kind
of smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big yield, super frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I wasn't I wasn't very well
versed with purple punch at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just like, oh, that's supposed to
be that weak plant, you know, like the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not very potent that people like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have this clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just stick it in the fucking corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever happened with the blue bonnet and
the purple punch?
[SPEAKER_00]: The tests, the THC ranges are all 22 to 35
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we all know that labs differ in range
on what they'll tell you percentage wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're buying a service,
the higher percentage, the more likely to
[SPEAKER_00]: come back or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still tests very high, much higher than
purple punch and much higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another thing that showed me
there's probably an outcross in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, packing on resin production,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, this combination of blueberry
and grape just turned out to be one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most beautiful mouthwatering fruity
flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the craziest things I've ever
I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I think in the future I'll
probably be doing more work on the line we
[SPEAKER_00]: called punchy bluster, which is the purple
punch banana OG blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll probably be doing more work on
that one, the bubble berry, which was the
[SPEAKER_00]: Indiana bubblegum blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a few more we'll probably
touch on in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had my druthers, I would only ever
work on the blue bonnet stuff because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was just that predictable to breed with
and everything that I'm seeing I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: But realistically, a lot of people have
had a lot of bad experiences with blue
[SPEAKER_00]: berry over the years and trying to explain
to someone how I.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the assistance of everyone that came
before me, Lone Star, DJ, we improved the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole blueberry line together and.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that people who've been
soured on blueberry need to try if you
[SPEAKER_00]: really haven't experienced true blueberry
jam, jelly turps, it's a it's it's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the more places that are
growing at, the more you're going to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: pop up because these are spitting keepers
left and right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that's that's the blue bonnet
story.
