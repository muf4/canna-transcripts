[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_01]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_01]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie
[SPEAKER_01]: Noxodon, Breeder and grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_01]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everyone, welcome to the Breeder's
Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Thousandfold, and I am not your
usual host.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a Breeder's Syndicate member and
collaborator, and today I have the unique
[SPEAKER_02]: privilege of welcoming Matt Riot onto his
own show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an episode that many of the Syndicate
members have been requesting, and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be all about Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've come up with some questions,
and I've also collected questions from
[SPEAKER_02]: other Syndicate members.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, Matt, to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today, Matt?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thank you for doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an awkward one, like we've talked
about, to have an interview of me on our
[SPEAKER_01]: own show, and I've kind of put it off for
a long time, like yours, just because I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't like taming the pool with me much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because people were asking so much,
what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a really important show,
and it's an absolute honor for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also was thinking this, it's such a
Matt punk rock move to be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's just get this guy who no one knows,
who has no cloud in the scene to interview
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did one for people who don't know,
we did one, not really an interview,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it kind of, you know, you filled the
questions in a chat forum on our Patreon
[SPEAKER_01]: Discord, and it was really, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt really comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought this is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect timing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I almost forgot about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're going to jump right into it,
and we're going to begin just with your
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first questions, I guess,
are how did you get into breeding at all
[SPEAKER_02]: to begin with?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, like my interest in strains,
well, first off, my dad was a grower and a
[SPEAKER_01]: dealer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, like, I've been around the black
market, as it were, my whole life,
[SPEAKER_01]: whole life, entire life.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was in and out of prison, so I didn't
live with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, he's my dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I got into plants by him at
a young age, but there was no,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, passion for it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I got into other kind of drugs as a
kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And much later on, one of my buddies had
moved to Alaska He got in trouble in high
[SPEAKER_01]: school and had to move to Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy Josh, shout out to Josh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he came back, like, after high school
a few years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were all hanging out at my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was the only one that was really
like a heavy stoner and not a heavy other
[SPEAKER_01]: drug user.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he's just a stoner for the most
part of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'd bring over this dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, God, what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was smoking stuff that was just
trashing my brain, like just getting
[SPEAKER_01]: zonked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had this story that he brought
about this strain called Matanuska Valley
[SPEAKER_01]: Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he told it to me, he told it to
me as Matanuska Valley Thunderfuck,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is kind of cool because later on,
I realized he actually had his shit
[SPEAKER_01]: together and knew exactly what it was
called and where it was from and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was just a kid at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when I started getting an
interest in actual strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he brought over high times and showed
me what white rhino was, white widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some of that started the bud of
what people would call white rhino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or white widow would show up in our
groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm like, we get to smoke that
and I'm not sure if it really was,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but that's kind of how my
interest started.
[SPEAKER_01]: When was this 2000, 2000, it would have
been right after high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 2000, 2001, somewhere in there when we
started getting those strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right after that, I mean, it took a
few a few years after medical started in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a few years before in our city,
there would be places that would kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: pop up as collectives, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it took, I'm trying to remember,
it would be about 2004, 2003, before they
[SPEAKER_01]: started really popping up in Oildale in
like the what's known as like the ghetto
[SPEAKER_01]: ghetto of Bakersfield, this place called
Oildale, predominantly Caucasian and a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of Matthews in that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the collectives were,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to roll through there to go there
because that's where the cops weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had to be outside of city limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that place is outside of technical
city limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember going in there and they had
this is the first time I saw the list of
[SPEAKER_01]: medical strains that were in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had sensei star, Durban poison,
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else was on there?
[SPEAKER_01]: White rhino, white widow and maybe one
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember what else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunk one or, you know, it wasn't O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush at the time yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's what was considered
medical strains in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a long time, I just assumed if it
wasn't on that list, it probably wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's like our understanding of
medical and California medical at the time
[SPEAKER_01]: was very, very minimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't until I moved to San Diego where
I had more money because I was working at
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony doing their bio health and support
web development stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had extra money and I could I could
grow like I got lights and I started
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, doing shit on my own,
buying seeds and experimenting a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's that's mainly when I
started getting into strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really didn't know what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like anyone that just jumps into
the seed community at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're trying to fill your way
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was going to high times, you know,
the typical skunk magazine and looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: who was in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, strains are cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, high times, you what I
didn't know at the time was like you open
[SPEAKER_01]: high times and it's one long ad,
one long almost paid ad in many cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of them look like interviews and
articles, but a lot of them are paid ads
[SPEAKER_01]: in ways where like people do parties for
high times and high times will reward them
[SPEAKER_01]: with an article or interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a way, it is an exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't do those exchanges,
you're not in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't understand all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought that these people were the
best at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like they were the ones every
time in high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I started like buying
seeds from B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bud Depot, places like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in doing that, I had collected,
you know, a large portion of strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a lot of money at first on E.J.
[SPEAKER_01]: Short's stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dutch Passion, DNA, a lot of DNA about us,
about so much DNA stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, were you buying these seeds
just to grow with or had you already been
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, at this point, I was just buying to
grow and I was already I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't thinking about breeding in the
sense of breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, I was thinking of making
more seeds for myself because this is
[SPEAKER_01]: getting very expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was more into keeping clones because
in California, that's what I understood
[SPEAKER_01]: was clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was more into popping seeds to get
clones to trade clones at that point,
[SPEAKER_01]: because like that's that was kind of the
hip thing to do in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Cal was like have clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got this rare clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but most of them weren't buying
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of those guys knew nothing about
buying seeds from Amsterdam or England.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of them did.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the guys that had clones, none of them
would do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was the one guy in our group that was
buying seeds from outside the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States and bringing those like selecting a
cut and passing those around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was weird for someone to pop up with
all these strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was such a noob.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went on Craigslist and posted that I was
wanting to trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my clones want to trade like that's
pretty new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, but at the time, like it was such a
wild west of the medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: community that it wasn't as crazy as doing
it like where people are killing people on
[SPEAKER_01]: Craigslist type shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like it's still pretty early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I met this dude,
Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was the main inspiration for
breeding, understanding breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was like my introduction into who
is a man named James Gonzalez,
[SPEAKER_01]: who also is known as James Hart.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did those two crews kind of,
you know, work out for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I met James, that was through Doug
and Doug and James were doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: partnership in a grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I brought over a bunch of my shitty,
I will say shitty selections of BC Bud
[SPEAKER_01]: Depot and like all these like Spanish
strains that I thought were Dutch,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the presidency stuff, all the DJ
short stuff, which a lot of it didn't pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what did was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was willing to trade me for some of
the rarest clones in California at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I had no clue how rare these things
were at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only in retrospect that I understood
what he gave me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like he had like fire OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a very good cut of Apollo 13,
which at the time is super rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else was there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he had the hog's breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was where I first saw that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, he had a whole library of amazing
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Kim D.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had Kim D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like long before anybody else,
he had Kim D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like that's super early on from Kim D.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's he would have been writing the crew
that got it via like several of those guys
[SPEAKER_01]: from Crazy Composer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would have been right in that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like he was working on a grow with
James, and that's how I met James and
[SPEAKER_01]: James owned Unified Collective in San
Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after meeting James, I would go in
there all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just, you know, like go in there,
kick it, talk braiding, talk about my
[SPEAKER_01]: interests and passions by clones from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had an amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had in May he had a big jar of seeds of
bubble berry, just a massive jar sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: up on the front counter and you could
reach in, grab it for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't even that much money he was
charging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like a dollar seed or whatever
time you grab it and give him 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was amazing, amazing bubble berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use that in some lines, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did he have?
[SPEAKER_01]: He had the P.E.H.T., which is the potent
evolved hybrid type from Neville early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It became known as Ed Rosenthal Super Bud
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had a really early cut of that,
which is just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had Northern Lights, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't say five, one, two, none of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just said Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Williams Wonder, he had that the MLB
Williams Wonder Major League Major League
[SPEAKER_01]: Bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot more in that crew,
but I would go in and we would talk
[SPEAKER_01]: reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: How old were you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was probably twenty five, twenty six,
twenty seven, somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was older and I was I wasn't a young man
at that time by my by my idea of life
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my mind, I got into this very late.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of people around me were
older.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are a lot of people around me
that were younger, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the Urban Grower Society,
that was kind of inspired by James because
[SPEAKER_01]: what we were seeing and this is something
that annoyed him and he kind of passed off
[SPEAKER_01]: onto me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he worked on his collective with this
on his own and he helped me with mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the idea was all these
collectives are majorly benefiting from
[SPEAKER_01]: medical patients, like real ones,
like terminally ill patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And charging them full price.
[SPEAKER_01]: For it, like they're opening these like
the people that are opening these
[SPEAKER_01]: collectives are doing this on the basis of
medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that were opening these were
not terminally ill for the most part,
[SPEAKER_01]: not not like any sort of medical anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were doing it for recreational,
which for me is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're doing it off the backs of
medical patients and these terminally ill
[SPEAKER_01]: patients, if we really believe what we're
doing and we really believe in the passion
[SPEAKER_01]: for this plant and its medical abilities,
there is no reason we should be charging
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my mind, there is no like not 10 bucks,
not 20 bucks, not 30 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you care and you can afford it,
you should be putting your own livelihood
[SPEAKER_01]: into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time, because the whole the way
it was, it just felt like it needed a big
[SPEAKER_01]: pushback.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what that was about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And James and me put together,
you know, I think it got up to like 43
[SPEAKER_01]: people in the community that were all
growing, that were all giving away their
[SPEAKER_01]: weed for terminally ill patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that that decision, that moment,
I mean, did one of the questions I had for
[SPEAKER_02]: you was, you know, what other influences
kind of had an impact on some of these
[SPEAKER_02]: decisions?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what what do you think drove you to
this kind of like more communal spirit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's to me, that seems rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so part of part of that was my best
friend's mom who raised me, died of
[SPEAKER_01]: pancreatic cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was when I was 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, 21 was 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she raised me like that was like my
mom, as much as my grandma or my mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must have been devastating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and he had died.
[SPEAKER_01]: He died a year before that, my best
friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was it was like double.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my God, we and no one was taking care
of her.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and she wasn't a pot smoker,
but she had when she was young.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she was willing to try cannabis during
those brief months.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was six months until she passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was trying to find any strain that
would help her any anything, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it was all black market shit at the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like I was trying to find
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw that, like, it would help her
get out of bed, come to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was able to eat dinner and hold it
down for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like it just gave her just that
much comfort.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was part of that passion,
like that burning feeling in my stomach
[SPEAKER_01]: that something had to be done for these
people, because I saw it firsthand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was someone I loved deeply.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the other thing was in communal
spirit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved out when I was like 11 of my
parents' house, my actual parents' house
[SPEAKER_01]: and moved in with my grandma.
[SPEAKER_01]: My grandma was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: She raised me great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like other people raised me,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of a street kid at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just did whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you call it latchkey kid or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in doing so, like I would go to punk
rock shows and play shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that community where we are at,
it was a very small community here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I got that community
spirit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had older dudes taking care of me,
like whether we were fighting and making
[SPEAKER_01]: sure I didn't get hurt, whether I was
drinking to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're telling me, fuck, do you grow
up?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like you can't do that,
you know, or whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a communal spirit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all kind of raised each other in a
weird way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happened in their lives deeply
affected my lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I brought that everywhere with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to go because I see the power in
numbers and the power in people and the
[SPEAKER_01]: power in love.
[SPEAKER_01]: As stupid as that sounds for me to say,
it really is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the power of being brotherly love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not just men.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see it in the syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We care about each other and it's very
passionate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also trust each other very deeply
and inherently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have reasons to.
[SPEAKER_01]: The actions build that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's where that idea came
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's such an amazing set of stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess the next logical thing to go on
to is what would you consider your first
[SPEAKER_02]: real breeding project?
[SPEAKER_01]: My first real breeding project where I was
breeding, breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing a few things at once at two
different locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if the clockwork cut when I was first
given it, it wasn't called Clockwork
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange, it didn't really have a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got a few different stories from
Doug, but the one I believe because I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't even like tell me it's just so
asinine.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I believe was that he went to a
coffee shop in Amsterdam and he ordered
[SPEAKER_01]: some Alaskan ice bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that bud, there was like two seeds
and he brought that home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grew them and one of the plants looked
like a monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like like we weren't used to a
lot of mutations at the time and seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy leaf mutations and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this thing, it had what we call the
crinkle leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people associate that with
OGKB or the legend cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those weren't big cuts at the time,
so we wouldn't associate it with any of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we call it the the crinkle cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I saw that plant, it was it was super
potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just super frosty, super dank,
but those leaves bothered me and I looked
[SPEAKER_01]: at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought no one's going to grow this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone's going to want to pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to think it's diseased,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my mind, I needed to put that into
seed and shake out that trait because I
[SPEAKER_01]: knew by this time that it could be done,
that you could shake out traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tried for a good year and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did some BX ones and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't do it accurately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could not find a potent version without
that crinkle leaf formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the time in my head, I thought it
was a link trait, as I understood it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stopped with the best selection that I
had from those seeds of my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what became the clockwork
orange cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just a crinkle leaf pheno from
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else did you do with that cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do we do with clockwork?
[SPEAKER_01]: We used it over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It became our flagship strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people assumed it was orangey
because of the name, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't have it up here anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm a big clockwork orange fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of my favorite movies.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of citrus in that movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of ultraviolence in that
movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the way that cut made me feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultraviolence, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it f*** you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got a bat to your legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was just super potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I named it that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people expected that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took a long time to explain that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we used it over the years on almost
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did several iterations of S1s that
would always sell out every time we had
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The BX1, we sold those, which was the
clockwork to the Neville Skunk to the
[SPEAKER_01]: clockwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Neville Skunk was a Neville Hayes
Skunk 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else did we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a clockwork cola that was kind of
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the AK-47 RC Cola Cut,
which never gets brought up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an old cut passed around on Skunk
Magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did clockwork cookies, which was
absolutely amazing for its time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But looking back, who gives a s*** about
clockwork cookies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of all the other things I've done with it,
who cares about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did the clockwork piff,
which was a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone is still taking through
generations right now, which was the
[SPEAKER_01]: doggy-style D73 piff from New York City
crossed to a reverse clockwork orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: We crossed it to everything we could that
we had at the time, slammed it to
[SPEAKER_01]: everything like most Paul and Chuckers
would.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was about 12 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even think I decided to let it go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what happened was that was with
the moms and the tissue culture thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes, it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a certain company, a certain company
killed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I lost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are S1s out there, but I just
decided to kind of move on, not because of
[SPEAKER_01]: anything about the strain, but I'd worked
with it for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my best friends, CSI,
gave me good advice to never tie yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: to one clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you do that, you don't
have... If someone starts working it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll feel super passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what do you move to?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're tied to one thing and you're kind
of one trick pony at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's best to, you know, not just tie
yourself to one thing and have that be
[SPEAKER_01]: your whole, try to make it a legacy,
because legacies aren't created.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something you have nothing to do
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, really, your actions, but not how
everybody perceives you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to be like Voldemort, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's got like these Horcruxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's distributed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to last.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Horcruxes, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use that a lot in life, that analogy to
a lot of things, because it's a great
[SPEAKER_01]: analogy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a systems perspective, it makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: To have one big dependency is extremely
fragile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes for an extremely fragile system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it totally makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, diversify.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing I was going to say as
well is that, like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you have friends who are still
working with the S1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that Kronzo?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kronzo has the Clockwork Pith.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denali has the Clockwork S1 cut and he has
a bunch of the old S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: The S1s are out there in the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting very old, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how well they pop for people
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I know like everybody who has
smoked Denali's cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is mind blown that it's as strong as
Chem D and has kind of no ceiling high
[SPEAKER_01]: that Chem D has, but it's totally
different.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for telling us about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mentioned a couple of other
projects of yours from earlier on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure like what order to go into,
but you know, you have Banana or G stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: Strawberry Cream, Babakush work,
Gisle work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see, where do I start?
[SPEAKER_01]: In that order, I want to say Banana would
probably come first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my Banana obsession came from a Banana
OG cut from Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the cuts that he gave me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember growing it in Fire OG next
to each other and being like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, I see the direct relation between
these two.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look identical, but they have totally
different turf profiles because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: separate parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever the Diablo OG's parent was was
more spicy peppery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever the Banana OG's parents was was
more skunk money, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was interested in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Banana was super rare at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Overgrow days had already passed,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we were about 2008, 2009,
by the time I start really working into
[SPEAKER_01]: Bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by this point, Banana had come,
gone and left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was novel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was unique and not a lot of people were
using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so I was like, fuck this,
I'm going to use this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got it, used it and was making
beautiful, beautiful Banana cuts that were
[SPEAKER_01]: super potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Banana seed lines that were super potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most interesting of me was a cut that
came via a guy named, his online name was
[SPEAKER_01]: Hugo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was a very good friend of mine over
the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he started off on my forum early and
we became like, we're still close to this
[SPEAKER_01]: day, me and him and his wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he brought me into Platinum Banana OG
cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was what it was called in his
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Platinum Banana OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this thing was just fire above fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Banana OG was originally a seed line
called OG Year's Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was from Oregon Kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where people were finding these
Banana Finos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the years, these got called
Banana OG that would pop up out of these
[SPEAKER_01]: OG Year's Kush packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it wasn't, it wasn't a seed line
called Banana OG early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually called OG Year's Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there were many people popping these
seeds and that's how these different
[SPEAKER_01]: Banana lines were found, Banana cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one was just so fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, oh, I got to S1 this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have got to S1 this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was, during these years, I was not as
versed on pollen control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had previously done a Bubba S1 run
right before this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I made these Platinum Banana OG
S1s, I think the cut that I selected,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was an outlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I seen a few other cuts that were like
this over the years from the same seed
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a feeling that there was
remnant Banana OG, or I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubba S1, reverse pollen in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was what made the Platinum Banana
OG S1s, was the Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not the Banana OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did reverse, but I think the pollen
might've been unviable and there was still
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen floating in the room of the Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was just not, I was not versed
on that at all, what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it made for some of the most beautiful
like expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've still seen today,
super black, frosty as anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: and just so banana, artificial Laffy Taffy
Banana came out of that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that line got me a lot of like acclaim
because it was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I don't look at it as like my
shit because it was Oregon kids,
[SPEAKER_01]: really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And random Bubba pollen, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: What was like the effects of that like?
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that stuff tended to have the OG
Kush high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is very hard to explain,
but it is a full bodied, like cerebral
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which what most people consider a super
hybrid at the time, like medically would
[SPEAKER_01]: be like considered hybrid type high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really it's just a full bodied,
full complex high that OG Kush has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's why it's so special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this carried that on very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bubba Kush, when grown well,
could do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a very similar type high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And combining the two just really,
really nailed it for its time,
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say.
[SPEAKER_01]: For its time, it was special to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was special to a few
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the ones that I actually
am proud of, is that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, like after years and years of
doing this, you learn to kind of drop any
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of ego from it and pride in what you
have done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more pride in what those have done
before you and that you were able to put
[SPEAKER_01]: out, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: At some point, it kind of becomes its own
thing in the world and has its own life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud that thing exists, but it's not
much more than anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how all breeding is in my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the timeline, this work comes
also before the great tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: debacle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fairly recent in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like five years ago or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe four, three or four.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was real recent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right before that, I had the bubble
work and the bubble work was, it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I got ahold of the Bubba Kush clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say that was from Ape at PNC,
People's Nursery Care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Ape.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of my stuff, like the strawberry
cream cut came from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a great, great, he had the best,
I will say, the best clone nursery up
[SPEAKER_01]: until that point I had ever seen with the
best provenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say to date, it is the best
nursery that ever existed with the best
[SPEAKER_01]: provenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that dude did his research.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cuts that he got, like 90% of the time
were accurate, which is way hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during that era, way harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude's still around and he's still legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, he's not often talked about by
breeders from California.
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked a swerve early on and was an
early owner of Cali Connection,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of his first partners and was
responsible for, you know, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: swerves cuts, but he doesn't get named
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured I'd bring him up now because
like he's even who Lumpy sent me down the
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies crew stuff really early on before
anyone else had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that Ape's the one who brought it down
from Lumpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to give him a lot of props here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Bubba, the bubble work,
yeah, it was, it was not new for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of people like Oregon kid
and all of them had done bubble work
[SPEAKER_01]: before me, CSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them had done bubble work before
me, but it was years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we know in cannabis, things are
cyclical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by that time, no one was making Bubba
S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: CSI had kind of dropped from the scene
completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he was doing his own thing,
cropping and stuff, and not really working
[SPEAKER_01]: online, not dealing with online business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a time in the market where I
could come in and make S1s, do Fem work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a time when people really,
really did not like what I was doing with
[SPEAKER_01]: feminizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And still today, people don't like it for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to, I have a question
specifically on, on Fem's and reversals
[SPEAKER_02]: later on, but I did want to ask a
tangential question here, which is,
[SPEAKER_02]: as an outsider, I find it interesting
because why Bubba Kush doesn't get named
[SPEAKER_02]: as much as OG and the 91, you know,
is that because it's kind of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: under the umbrella of OG or kind of in the
shadow of OG, Bubba doesn't seem to get
[SPEAKER_02]: its own mention a lot, even though there's
a lot of work done with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know why there's like
the OG obsession and not the Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubba Kush is half OG Kush as it's been
told.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I would agree, you can smell OG
Kush in it if you grow it certain ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's always lived in the shadow of
OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot, I don't want to say it's
harder to grow because it's really easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to cure and dry Bubba to
get it to be right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people lose Bubba in the
cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people say Bubba's boof because
of it, you know, and it doesn't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: super rounded high that OG Kush has or the
THC percentage OG has most importantly.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is potent and it does have a
similar quality of high, I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not as skyrocket potent as some of
OGs will get you, but it does have a
[SPEAKER_01]: similar quality high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think probably the THC
percentage, because that's so important to
[SPEAKER_01]: people in California and collectives,
is probably what keeps Bubba from kicking
[SPEAKER_01]: up to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's usually like 18 to 20,
you know, and that 21 is usually the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It fidges really slowly as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more squat than OG, but it's still
kind of, depending on how you grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can make that thing grow lanky,
but it is slower to grow than OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as slow as things like Urkel,
but it has a reputation for being slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're happy with the, you know,
that account of your Bubba work,
[SPEAKER_02]: shall we move on to the strawberry cream?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So strawberry cream I got from,
again, Ape at PNC and I didn't know much
[SPEAKER_01]: about it for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than first, I didn't even know if it
was the same one from CBF.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time I got it, it was right when
Ape was closing up and he had closed shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lost contact at the very, like I'd
gotten it a month later.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was gone and we lost contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't know much about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a lot of years trying to figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was convinced it was an herb beer
because it grew exactly like that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: herb beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started growing these and it smelled
like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I found out was that it came from
strawberry cough, which strawberry cough
[SPEAKER_01]: is supposed to be strawberry because of a
strain called strawberry fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we haven't identified that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have some suspicions from breeding
stuff in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the story goes that CBF got some S1s
of strawberry cough from Golden Eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Golden Eyes was a female on Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: She worked with Black Russians,
some Shishkeberry stuff and the strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he popped him, he got some males
and females, which probably means pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination, which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was doing a lot at that time in a
small space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he crossed those two together and
that's what started Strawberry Cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this line was so resinous,
so mold resistant, so strawberry,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it bred so strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything it touched was just bag up
hill to the nines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turp wise, amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The high was a lot, lot less than you
would say like an OG kosher Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't the same kind of high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so much more mild.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would put it in the Silver Pearl era
category of highs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it always took away my anxiety,
which I like, you know, it took the edge
[SPEAKER_01]: off, but it wouldn't like lay me out to
where I felt like I was always saying
[SPEAKER_01]: something stupid, you know, I didn't get
stupid mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate having stupid mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what I'm talking about where
like you perceive yourself as saying
[SPEAKER_01]: something stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if everything comes out of your mouth
and you're like, did I say something
[SPEAKER_01]: stupid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I hate that kind of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is not that kind of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, bag up hill to the nines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Cedarberry Farms stepped off the
forums for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really hard to hunt down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during that time, I did a lot of work
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I BX1'd it and I crossed it to Johnny
Blaze from Legend Seeds, Red from Legend
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds, I believe, made Johnny Blaze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a Neville's Haze DJ Short
Blueberry Male.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I did that was because in the
room, I had Santa Cruz Blue Dream right
[SPEAKER_01]: next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed that these two cuts and I
used to have side by side pictures of all
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But and I probably do somewhere on a hard
drive, but side by side, they looked
[SPEAKER_01]: almost identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very hard to tell the difference of
them in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, I was like,
oh, Blue Dream will be the perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: outcross if I want to make a regular seed
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I go back to BX1 making regular
seed lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made regular seed lines of this stuff
because I had caught so much flack for
[SPEAKER_01]: feminine seeds over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: By this point, we're talking 2009,
2010, 2011 of my strawberry work,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's about I always put it about a
three year period because that's how long
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes to do serious work on lines for
me to go from popping them to testing and
[SPEAKER_01]: running them to a possible BX1 if I'm
happy or to finding out that I screwed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about three years to figure out whether
I'm doing good with the line or not to the
[SPEAKER_01]: point where I can sell it and get it out
there in mass and the testers have gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: back to me if I use testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was I at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those three years I was doing strawberry
brain fart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strawberry cream and you forget what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strawberry where, oh yeah,
CBF was gone during those years in 2009,
[SPEAKER_01]: 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not like I could reach out to
him and talk to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was releasing this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Johnny Blaze was the outcross in it
because of the Blue Dream stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just, it was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody that got it liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also had during these years,
I had an East Coast sour diesel strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: cream from CBF and seed that I had traded
for by this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had already during the first two
years, I had crossed East Coast sour
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel, the Chaco cut I called it,
but it was just East Coast sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I crossed that to a strawberry cream BX1
mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did not like the results,
but I popped CBF's East Coast sour diesel
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry cream and immediately
everything was fired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every last seed from that line was a
keeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I used a mail from that line in
further work, which also made more
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the most famous work that came
from the East Coast sour diesel strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: cream or the stuff that gained most
popular was the strawberry switch blade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, that's in that strawberry vein.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is my, when people ask about my
strawberry work and what I think I liked
[SPEAKER_01]: best, I would say the strawberry switch
blade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only because it had the potency of the
sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had the looks and smell of strawberry
cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had the color of one of the
parents, which was a double purple Doja.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, it was double red Doja,
which was a hybrid of double purple Doja.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just blood red, beautiful
magenta with blood red leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that trait passed on pretty regularly
in the strawberry switch blade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like the best of all three
parents constantly lining up well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like realistically, CBF's line was so
good and so true breeding for whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if he had taken it
generations and that's what I got,
[SPEAKER_01]: or it just lined up perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for whatever reason, his line was so
true breeding to anything I touched with
[SPEAKER_01]: it was fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it was strawberry switch blade,
what else?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberry champagne, which was the Placor
cookies cut across to the East Coast sour
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel strawberry cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't hit a lot of stuff during that
week because I was trying to do more
[SPEAKER_01]: selective breeding and only hitting
certain females that I liked a lot with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in doing that, I came out with some
stuff that I really loved and that
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry switch blade was for sure one
and it still goes around and cuts all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the place.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that the strawberry switch
blade has some mythological status within
[SPEAKER_02]: the syndicate and it gets talked about
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in magazines a lot too,
which like some of the stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: clockwork orange and strawberry switch
blade.
[SPEAKER_01]: My platinum banana OG, my bubble work and
what we'll talk about with the diesel work
[SPEAKER_01]: were all featured in skunk magazine
heavily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of that I think contributed to
its mythological status more than me or
[SPEAKER_01]: more than the strain necessarily earned on
its own because back then in print was
[SPEAKER_01]: like every grower and breeders goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to get in high time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to get in skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's when you made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like that was the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, by the time it was like those
years, 2010, 2011, I had already figured
[SPEAKER_01]: out the high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had already been told by Danny Denko
at this point, if you do not work with us,
[SPEAKER_01]: you will never make it and I will
guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, I was like,
fuck you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch me, motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I worked with skunk magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extensively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was because of the rev and like
we were homies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And had I not been homies, maybe that
wouldn't have happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank goodness we were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's crazy to think that like that era
of print media kind of gatekeeping all
[SPEAKER_02]: this stuff wasn't that long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And up until the the Marley's bought high
times, I think it was still the standard
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you did not it's I mean,
maybe not as much now, but up until fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: recently, if you did not advertise in high
times, you didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the most part, if you do advertise
in high times now as a breeder,
[SPEAKER_01]: you still make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still still looked at as a
respectable source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm still blacklisted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's never going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't want it to anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like at this point?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's definitely lost a lot of
its shine with with other people in the
[SPEAKER_02]: community as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, even new and not to run to it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did mention the diesel work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's a good segue into the diesel
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the diesel I got really early on from
Bodhi, my friend Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't talked about him as much yet
with how much of an influence he was on my
[SPEAKER_01]: clone work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was a major, major, major reason I
had any of the rare clones from the online
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess I could talk about this part
now because it is relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: During these years, people were locking me
out of cuts specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if people don't know what that
means, it means in the cut circles,
[SPEAKER_01]: because there were still only a few clone
circles that really had the cuts,
[SPEAKER_01]: the rare cuts and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were trading, people would tell
Bodhi or other breeders, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have this, but make sure Matt
Wright doesn't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was because I was doing fem work
and they did not want their clones S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought that if I S1 their clones,
the value would drop in their clones,
[SPEAKER_01]: the trade value would be worthless and
other people would grow it and their
[SPEAKER_01]: cropping would be hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like their money in their pocket would be
hurt from cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't give this to Matt Wright.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some in some respects, I get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I get why they thought that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least in my mind, if they understood
breeding, they would understand how hard
[SPEAKER_01]: it is to get a same representation of the
same exact cut like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like it's asinine, but I get why
they thought that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times it would be people that
I liked and that were my friends doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for people I considered friends doing
it to me and locking me out of cuts
[SPEAKER_01]: because they wanted to protect their
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it would be that awkward
conversation where like, yo bro,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I get that you're you know,
you're a breeder in that it's not fair and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of fucked and it looks like I
don't like you, but I don't want you
[SPEAKER_01]: feminizing my cut and your words not good
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I never ever get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never feminized anyone's anything that had
any stipulations on anything, but that
[SPEAKER_01]: never mattered.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never mattered because the potential
was there if it's in my hands for them to
[SPEAKER_01]: be scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that was a big, big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as far as sourcing cuts, it was very
hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I had to, and I think it's a lot of
why I started this historian side of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: and tried to get into anthropology was
because I had to go to sources to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: cuts, because it wasn't just like when
people locked me out that I would just be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I mean, I feel like I should
signpost here for everyone that you were
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the, I guess, pioneers of femwork
reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, I guess like in American
breeding, there weren't a lot of us doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was OG Rascal, me, CSI had done some
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe Hive had done some work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chimera had done some work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were others, but like,
as far as doing it big with a big name,
[SPEAKER_01]: big name, you know, like one of the top 50
breeders that were putting seeds out big,
[SPEAKER_01]: there were only a few of us and nobody
wanted to mess with Rascal because he was
[SPEAKER_01]: a gangster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he looked like a gangster,
like a gangbanger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like nobody's going to mess with Rascal
except me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like an asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're friends now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like he didn't catch the flak that I
did, but I caught so much shit and it
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't help because of my attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like when people would do that to
me, I'd be like, okay, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go to the source because
you're making up roles on a clone that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have no rights to go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to find out who the source is
and I'm going to go get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's how this works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it didn't always work, you know,
but a lot of times it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that caused a lot of derision.
[SPEAKER_01]: And delusion, you know, maybe like from my
perspective, like it caused some ego
[SPEAKER_01]: melting and hatred because all of a sudden
the cut that they locked out, locked me
[SPEAKER_01]: out of, I got, and I could pass freely
because I went to the source of the
[SPEAKER_01]: person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, did you lock people out of this
cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: And 99% of the time they'd be like,
I don't care who has that cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, 99% of the time when you get
to the source, that's exactly how the
[SPEAKER_01]: source feels.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's more people down the line
that have no reason, no permission to lock
[SPEAKER_01]: people out of cuts where that pops up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess at this stage, you're becoming
an easy target as well, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mouth didn't help because I'm very
like, people didn't know me.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I, you know, like they see me on the
reader syndicate now and me and not so
[SPEAKER_01]: talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to be, I like, I'm, I got a
mouth like I'm there, but I'm a very
[SPEAKER_01]: reserved version of who I used to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's some from growing up and
experience.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was very reactionary and I still can
be, I don't have much of an edit button,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like when people challenge me,
it's not, it's like, I, I've always had
[SPEAKER_01]: that in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a short kid, like a punk rock kid in
a, in an oil community, like oil worker
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've always had these challenges and
people challenge me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I push back hard and that doesn't bode
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, do that to a fucking a thousand
people online over, you know, two decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to get super pissed,
you know, like it doesn't do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And diesel was a cut from chem dogs crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was one of the ones that didn't
have any stipulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got it from podi and it was one of
these cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I got it, I realized, Holy shit,
this is skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during those years, people weren't
really looking for skunky stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some people were, but it wasn't
like all the rage roadkill skunk that
[SPEAKER_01]: people try to die for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't that, I want to ask this point as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, did it have much of a reputation at
this point at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: It w it was in the canna Bible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like with clones, like anything that made
it in the canna Bible from Jason King got
[SPEAKER_01]: legendary status.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was in there as one of the
examples of the chem chem dog family,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for whatever reason, because it wasn't
called chem or dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't sour, something it flew
under the red radar is diesel,
[SPEAKER_01]: which meant G G's diesel, like G is chem
dogs name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we call them G so G's diesel,
but it was called diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because the name, I think it
wasn't a catchy name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just never caught on, but it was passed
to a few people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those few people were great growers
and loved it because they saw all the
[SPEAKER_01]: skunkiness in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's a hard grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not super frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people dropped it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's paid no attention to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the years, that's kind of what
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started working with it and the
lines that I worked with it were super
[SPEAKER_01]: resinous and super frosty and super
skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, you know, those got in skunk
magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those got a claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we did diesel cross to a West coast
dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shug night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, G B X one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we did, uh, what else?
[SPEAKER_01]: We did diesel across to something called
chem dog D DNL diesel, Norden lights from,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, JJ, New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we did, I mean, diesel blue bonnet
later on, uh, diesel East coast,
[SPEAKER_01]: our diesel strawberry cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't think we ever did a clockwork
diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, they were never in the room
flowering at the same time to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But pretty much diesel is like become one
of my loves of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I love the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the smoke of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how it breeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what I believe is a great
representation of a, of a, of a super
[SPEAKER_01]: stunk from Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, on that note, and I,
you can cut this out if you don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: people to know this here, but they are,
you have been dropping hints that you
[SPEAKER_02]: might be returning to some diesel work
with CSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, CSI, I tried convincing him for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had the cut in 2006 and totally
forgot that he ever had the cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like it's on his clone list,
you know, of stuff he had.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got, yeah, he just forgot what his
like and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he didn't even remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: He ran it, didn't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I kept bugging him for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, dude, you've got to try this
cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's so good and so stunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I mean, like he gets told
that by hundreds of people all the time
[SPEAKER_01]: about cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it took me some years and years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he finally, you know,
gave it a whirl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, Holy shit, this thing's
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's not a diesel fan in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't like sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he doesn't like smoking sour,
not a fan of how it breeds really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the fact that it was more like a,
of a diesel-y type cut than it is by turp
[SPEAKER_01]: wise, more of a diesel-y type cut and
looks, then it would be considered a chem
[SPEAKER_01]: type cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in smell, it's not chem-y necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's skunky, but not like burnt tennis
ball rubber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he just didn't seem to have much
interest, but he got it and he's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, this is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we are doing, uh, an S ones and a
full reverse line together of diesel to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring it back and to bring some big time
diesel reverse back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and cry babies done some work
with it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I, you know, I passed the cut to
people in our crew to like bitter and cry
[SPEAKER_01]: babies got it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Denali's got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People, people were running it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, um, packs running it to,
uh, Santa Cruz goat farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people are going to be doing a
lot of diesel stuff and, and, and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: all because of Bodie really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he kept the cut forever and passed it
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without Bodie doing that, I never
would have had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all these other people would have had
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to both.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really cool that you get to
return to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, again, and I'm like, life is a bit
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you feel this way,
but I feel like life sometimes works in
[SPEAKER_02]: spirals.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you kind of come back,
but it's not exactly the same,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you're still back in the same place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it makes me feel happy that like,
cause like, a lot of people don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but me and CSI, we've been very good
friends for five or six years now,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think really close friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before that we weren't like,
we weren't enemies, but we just didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really talk much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would try to poke in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, this is one of those stories
where it's like a, uh, almost like a
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching regret story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one that I tell to newcomers when
they make similar mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, when I first heard about CSI,
and saw what he was doing, I was enamored
[SPEAKER_01]: with his reading skill and his knowledge
and his ability to hunt down history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and even on his old forum posts,
which were around back then to look at
[SPEAKER_01]: watching him just level people that would
try to scam, that would try to just be
[SPEAKER_01]: corrupt.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would level them and he would level
them with their own words and let them do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just ask like two, two, two word
questions and let them disassemble
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves in front of everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was, it's magic to watch and he
can still do it, but he does it less,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, because of the, the flack that I
caught, the flack that he caught,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like people were fucking nuts
when you do this to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I would love to go dig through the
forum archives for some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not, most of them aren't even
there anymore, which sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those forms are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I, I, I, I was enamored with his
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I sent him a message early on and I was
like, Hey, I am good friends with blank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was someone I thought that he was
super close with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I knew had gotten clones of CSI
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I assumed that they must be super
close.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that this dude's gone to his house
and he says they're good friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, okay, I'm going to name drop
this person.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good friend of mine that I've
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've given him money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've given it like his truck was getting
impounded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I fucking let him stick his name on a
collab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sell seeds to a seed bank and gave
them all the seeds for free to keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: money, you know, like things like this,
big things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I assume this was a very good friend
of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, this is a mutual friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to speak to you more,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really, really into what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is where that moral of the
story comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always be careful how you introduce
yourself to people because you never know
[SPEAKER_01]: what their real impression is of the
person you're name dropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you name drop a person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you only have one chance to make a
first impression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you name drop someone that is bad
and a scammer and all that shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: no one's going to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for 10 years, he stayed away from me
because of that because he's super
[SPEAKER_01]: careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he doesn't want to invite chaos in
his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't blame him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's a busy man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, yeah, yeah, he doesn't do
the foreign drama stuff anymore at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just not in his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was very hesitant to talk to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So several years ago, Emerald Cup,
we had a booth next to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working with NCGA and splitting a
booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed CSI was next to me at the
booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and he never really responded to my
message.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew he had seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through other people, I had heard that
he didn't like what I had to say about
[SPEAKER_01]: like males and femme seeds and stuff like
that, which in the end, he was correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was a noob.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had all these other notions about me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went up and I shook his hand,
said, hi, I'm at the right seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, really appreciate you and your work
and what you do for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walked away, sat down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I knew he was busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were coming up, grabbing seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to take too much of
people's time from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where they make the most money in
the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so after that, um, he messaged me or
emailed me or no, it was on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: He messaged me and he's like, Hey,
there's my number hit me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we talked and he explained,
you know, some of the preconceived
[SPEAKER_01]: notions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, he really respected that
despite all of that, that I still came up,
[SPEAKER_01]: shook his hand like a man and walked and
didn't like say, Hey, why didn't you do
[SPEAKER_01]: this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why didn't you email me back?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like any petty shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like mandarin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey dude, I respect you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he appreciated that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we started talking and quickly
became best of friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, we're very close
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our group's big.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all best friends in our group.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean like, uh, we're very
close and I, he's one of the people I
[SPEAKER_01]: would do anything for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it was weird because I went from
going from someone who is an absolute fan
[SPEAKER_01]: boy, fan boy extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, cause there's no one bet in my mind
still, there's no one better in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that's ever done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Rob Clark, not anyone, no offense to
Rob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think he's a God of cannabis,
but as far as breeding work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Showing it, having all of it and,
and the amount of reading work,
[SPEAKER_01]: the real breeding work that's gone in and
the years of it, no one's done it more.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one does it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's done it more precise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to go from that to being someone's
close friend and a man and men,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he mentors me in ways, like teaches me
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to learn from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a mind blowing process that's
happened to me a few times over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And despite all of the opinions online
about me and the, the magnitude of fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: disgust that it seems like people have,
I've been fortunate to work with who I
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will come back to some of those
events as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that your friendship with the
CSI sounds really special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same goes for Bodhi too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like I hold Bodhi in the same esteem
and he was probably the main inspiration
[SPEAKER_01]: for what I made and what I worked with
early on, even before we were close
[SPEAKER_01]: friends, I just saw what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, God, that guy's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing something no one else is doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What like purple Kush, double purple Doja.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't what the Dutch people are
working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fricking cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he was a major inspiration for my
early work and it was the same kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We became friends and slowly became very
close.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the years, definitely a man.
[SPEAKER_01]: A mentor in my life, a hundred thousand
percent a mentor in my life, not just with
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding, but in life, how to deal with
people, how things, how we should look at
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: His perspective is so unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a beautiful human.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, those, those two figures,
especially definitely strike me even as
[SPEAKER_02]: someone who's this far away as being
really special spirits and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the community and it's crazy,
but also, you know, they, they both
[SPEAKER_02]: recognize you and what you were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's, that's, that's,
that's a trip and it's an honor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to this day, I still have trouble
wondering why even that you better believe
[SPEAKER_01]: it, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, it's, it's hard to understand why,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, I, I nonetheless, I respect them
and I thank them, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not like a something I've ever
overlooked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got a big one coming up,
which is about all your blueberry work and
[SPEAKER_02]: how you encountered it to begin with and
why you decided to keep going with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did talk about the fact that you might
still want to have a dedicated blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: episode later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe this can be like a miniaturized
version.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So blueberry, the first blueberry I ever
smoked was from this, I won't say his name
[SPEAKER_01]: because this is like, we were doing a lot
of other dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude in town and it was after the
medical clubs, it all opened up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is like 2000, three or four,
and he was bringing in kilos and kilos and
[SPEAKER_01]: kilos of fricking blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was phenomenal blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't, it had a blueberry flavor that
would zing the tip of your tongue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hard to describe, but it wasn't as
blueberry smelling as what I love in
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry, but the fact that it would zing
the tip of your tongue and had a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of blueberry taste was just phenomenal
and it had a great high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was one of the ones that I smoked
very early on that I was chasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I started buying seeds and
learning that you could import seeds from
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam and actually the beginning of
that seed buying experience, the UK became
[SPEAKER_01]: very big.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the end of importing seeds from
Amsterdam direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the UK seed bank started popping
up and one of those early ones was like
[SPEAKER_01]: seed madness UK seed madness.co.uk not
sure if they're still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they are not sure that that's the
same URL, but that's what it was during
[SPEAKER_01]: those years.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were great people, nice people,
not scammers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe a few years after that,
like the attitude popped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But during these years, a lot of the seed
banks were on forums and they were small
[SPEAKER_01]: British forums where people bought their
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not around anymore to look at
none of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potpint, Kanazon, Kinetics, Cali something
rather.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a bunch of little tiny seed banks
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I went to seed madness.co
.uk and that's where I bought all of my DJ
[SPEAKER_01]: short stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember I'd gotten a big bonus at
Sony and I spent a large chunk all at once
[SPEAKER_03]: on blueberry flow, blueberry flow,
F13, Coco Kush, Bananas, Anna Luna.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are the main four.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be an, oh, great crush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the big five that I bought early
on those five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dougie had a clone of blue velvet,
blue heaven and blue moonshine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to run all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after spending a ridiculous amount of
money, so much money, on blueberry,
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't find much that I liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found one local.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I get you to pause there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to ask you like,
how, why were you interested in those
[SPEAKER_02]: lines to begin with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of that, that zing on my tongue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like literally it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in the start, like it was unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never had that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, wow, that's what
blueberry is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to, I'd like to check that out
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that was literally it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't even the blueberry smelling
canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that I had quite experienced yet that
it like, then like, Oh my God,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm obsessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing was DJ short's books
and pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the most beautiful plants I had
ever seen in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were beautiful purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves were purple purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: How they grew was real unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just so unique looking that it
was just, it stood out in cannabis so much
[SPEAKER_01]: during this era.
[SPEAKER_01]: There weren't really a lot of purples you
were seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was, not a lot of purple oracle work
online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some, you know, but there was a,
purples are kind of rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like double purple Doja popping
up and Sputnik one and two, those kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: purples and blackberry stuff were rare,
hard to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people were chasing it and it was
being kind of gate kept.
[SPEAKER_01]: And DJ short's work was another way to get
into purples and breed with purples.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we all knew it would take selection
because we had heard, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that maybe you won't find stuff you like
in every pack of DJ shorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: The major problem I had was the seed
germination rate was very, very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're talking four or five packs of
one thing didn't pop at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I germ rate by this time, my germ,
my germ skills at this time were really
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hog was helping me pop these and his
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like, I can look back and say,
probably not my fault at this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And later on, there was that normal to
have that kind of germ rate even for that
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fairly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the seeds that were the seeds you
would get in packs, dude, during that
[SPEAKER_01]: time, probably even now, I don't know,
I don't buy other breeders packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were, there were a lot of immature
seeds in here, like not just small because
[SPEAKER_01]: small seeds can be mature, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Small seeds come from all plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants have only small seeds,
small black ones with no tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are big, fat gray and modeled with no
tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiger stripes for people that don't know
are, is a thin layer of sheath that can
[SPEAKER_01]: come off the skin, like the husk,
if people don't know, if people don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, it's not necessarily a descriptor
of maturity, but it's a great way to tell,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that it looks better when
they're all like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the seeds you would get in these packs
were just totally immature, no weight or
[SPEAKER_01]: heft to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could squish them, pop them in your
fingers with no problem, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was common, but five packs,
that was not common.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what ended up happening later on was
they had to replace every single DJ short
[SPEAKER_01]: pack that they sold during this era for
every customer, because everyone was
[SPEAKER_01]: having these germ rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't just me at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ended up being a big deal for the UK
buyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what else was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went through those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found two flow clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I kept and I had an F13 that I really
liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought was beautiful, but no
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nothing that was, that was
hardcore blueberry, nothing that was
[SPEAKER_01]: berry, berry, berry smelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was disappointing to me because I
thought like that if you go through enough
[SPEAKER_01]: of his stuff, you're going to find berry,
berry, berry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I got, I got a few beautiful
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some that smelled like floral
incense, floral incense and slight berry,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the slightest, you know, but by this
time I had already smelled the Dabney blue
[SPEAKER_01]: cut a little bit, which was blueberry
muffins a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, this is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And shortly after this, a guy named
Astartez from a forum called Potpimp gave
[SPEAKER_01]: me DJ's mom cut of blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one had more berry to it and was
purple and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can breed berry plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not often, but it can, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's when it started the berry
obsession and the berry work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually I was working at a place called
BCC as their master grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the title they gave me,
master grower at their collective to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were letting me breed at the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone brought in a, a jar of bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I got this bud, I smelled it and
it smelled like peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like Jiffy sweet, creamy peanut
butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, dude, to the owner,
I was like, dude, we let me pick these
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, yeah, just be careful to
pick them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I uncarefully picked them out,
destroyed the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's what you have to do to get
all the good seeds and destroy the shit
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I asked, I was like, Hey dude,
what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, um, cause it was being sold a
strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew that he changed that shit all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'll collect this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, well, we have a strawberry cough,
but they brought it in as blueberry,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it doesn't smell like blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made a mental note, you know,
they said it was blueberry, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took those seeds home, popped them
and out came the most purple blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: smelling, tasting plant I have ever seen
by this, up to this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it looked like what, what DJ Short
had shown is Oregon purple tie back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was purple blueberries,
zero peanut butter in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some of the other parents were frosty
peanut butter, Afghani type plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this one had more, what people would
consider narrow leaf traits and just
[SPEAKER_01]: purple blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the cut that I originally
named Riotberry and that I used for all of
[SPEAKER_01]: my earliest blueberry work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was like in a way, the very first
moment of actually having what you were
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the moment where I was like,
this is the one with the taste and smell
[SPEAKER_01]: of blueberry in the looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what it didn't have was any sort of
potency, but what it, what it did have was
[SPEAKER_01]: medical relevance.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I noticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I realized this, I was out of all
my weed and I had a tooth abscess at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like in tears and pain,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have dental insurance,
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was my very first tooth abscess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what was going on,
but I felt like I was dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and you know, like ibuprofen wasn't
helping nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I smoked some Riotberry cause it was
all I had and I expected nothing to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just what I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And immediately the nerve pain went away
from that tooth and I wasn't in pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Holy shit, this is
magical.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when other people, I saw,
I started giving it to other people in
[SPEAKER_01]: the, in the crew that had like back pains,
nerve pains, and they were experiencing
[SPEAKER_01]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were getting anti-anxiety effects and
complete relief from nerve pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they didn't, they didn't get high at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they could go to work, do stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goal was to make some potency with
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I crossed it into an OG Kush Pakistani
Chitrali regular seed line that I had for
[SPEAKER_01]: a male side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I made what became called Riotberry
OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there I selected, or actually I
didn't even select this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: A dude named Jerry Jeremiah selected a
clone from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he gave it back to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I used in my lines as
Riotberry OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And almost every line from, from,
um, 2008 on, or no, I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_01]: 2010 on would be with the Riotberry OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strictly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So would this be like your first
generation, I guess of blueberry work?
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be, cause I did release the
Riotberry seeds originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I even gave out a bunch of the
bag seeds that I had left because there
[SPEAKER_01]: were a shit load of seeds in that jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I even gave those seeds out,
but, uh, I made F twos of original
[SPEAKER_01]: Riotberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I thought would be a blueberry
version of that clone in male form,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I, who knows to this day,
if it was correct, but it made a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: berry line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Riotberry was the first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Riotberry OG was where I was like
fucking slam it out of the park.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is potent enough to be relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cross it to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how it breeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was true breeding for the blueberry
trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where I made things like blueberry
cookies, uh, which we called cookie berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And which is probably my most knocked off
line today, like renamed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made something called cookie berry
diesel, which was during my, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: when we were doing the day record diesel
BX one for the male side, uh, when we were
[SPEAKER_01]: crossing that to everything, that's when I
made the cookie berry diesel and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, that was crossing cookie berry,
a best selection of the cookie berry,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was the Riotberry OG berry dominant
Fino cross to Girl Scout cookies,
[SPEAKER_01]: form cut reversed in 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: Made those and then cross that to the
original diesel BX one, which was the
[SPEAKER_01]: project following, um, um, the,
the cookies reversal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I right in thinking as well that you
were one of the earlier people to work
[SPEAKER_02]: with cookies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in 2010, cookies kind of popped up and
by 2011, it was almost a race to some
[SPEAKER_01]: people to get it put out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, it became a race when people found
out that I got the cut from lumpy and was
[SPEAKER_01]: making S ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like, there weren't many people
feminizing at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and that, and they knew I was
going to put it out pure, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So first person to put out anything
cookies that I recall was a company called
[SPEAKER_01]: Canavan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they put out a cookies cross to some
sort of train wreck hybrid, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like, I think they called it
cookie wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not even two months later,
my reversal is done and we're testing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're already in the middle of
testing by that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have train wreck cross to cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have cookies crossed to pretty much
everything in my room at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I want to see how this unique,
weird plant that people are obsessing over
[SPEAKER_01]: braids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be the first person to see how it
braids reversed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I put out the cookies pure and then
not even a week later, swerve from Cali
[SPEAKER_01]: connection, put out his version of
cookies, fems, which when people actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: and people were buying his versus mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people grew his out, it was just OG
Kush and we're super pissed and BC bud
[SPEAKER_01]: depot within a week, like the same week as
mine came out, put out their version of
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies and animal cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I did cookies and I almost put out
the animal cookies as ones, but I,
[SPEAKER_01]: but at the last minute after I made them,
someone said that I'm not allowed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't, uh, nor IC mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause, uh, he said I wasn't allowed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't, but, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, BC bud depot released a fake version
of animal cookies, which ruined that line
[SPEAKER_01]: and name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they also put out a fake version
of cookies too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, when this happens,
people just jumped to the cheapest or who
[SPEAKER_01]: has the biggest name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't necessarily mean any of
those people have the clone because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're the ones who are advertising in
high times and get the first sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean that they have the ability
to get the clone or the morals to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what people saw, but it took
almost a year, you know, for people to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow these things out and see who actually
had the legit shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by that time in that year,
other people had gotten it and were
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to make crosses and release them
with the real cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I had done with it meant nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and, and by that time,
when I, when everybody got the cut,
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want my name to be associated
with it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like, I'm going to sink back
into the shadows that I even use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like instead of trying to be
like, no, man, I was the first that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: just like, like now y'all have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the same way with like working with
gelato 33, you know, I was the first one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the first with that cut and the first
to make S ones, the first to make gelato
33.
[SPEAKER_01]: With skittles and shit and which became
runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, no, I don't want anything to
do with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was the reason I say that now is
because in retrospect, it just became hype
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was doing it, I wanted to see what
was in it because nobody else was working
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming, coming back then to your blueberry
journey after cookie berry, what happened
[SPEAKER_02]: after that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So after cookie berry, and the right berry
OG stuff, I lost my right berry OG mom,
[SPEAKER_01]: the blueberry one in a plague.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this plague of something,
which probably was HPLV looking back.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a plague of something killed every mom
in my room, including that from taking
[SPEAKER_01]: clones in from outside clones and not
being fastidious enough and using the same
[SPEAKER_01]: razor blade shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just being not being fastidious because
most people weren't at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm being real, like we didn't know
that HPLV and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that took out the mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, okay, I've made the best
blueberry shit I could ever make.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I moved on to strawberry
work, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I sold out of all of these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: People bought all of my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during these years, I wasn't making a
lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I was literally selling every
last pack of everything I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I'm not a shit bag,
like I like to think I'm not, I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to pretend I had these cuts or
seed lines just to keep making sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the lines were discontinued.
[SPEAKER_01]: I no longer had the cut and I was done,
but I felt like I had done everything I
[SPEAKER_01]: could with blueberry at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we jumped to what I told you about was
when all of my clones got lost with the
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue culture person who will remain
nameless because he doesn't deserve to be
[SPEAKER_01]: named.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that happened, I lost every clone in
my room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh my God, I need to do
something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had always had this long affinity
for blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during those years, I hadn't smoked
any.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I sold every last seed of
everything I had of my right berry OG
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, I was like, hmm, I wonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember during my blueberry years
on Breed Bay, there was this dude named
[SPEAKER_01]: Lone Star and people would talk his
blueberry up all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is the most blueberry thing I've
ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course my ego during those years
didn't let me like, oh really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me check out your blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine was already like, fuck your
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the best one, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't need his shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I need his shit for I got the
best one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I lost everything, I looked in my
seed collection and realized that I had
[SPEAKER_01]: amassed a massive, massive selection of
all the blueberry lines that I could find
[SPEAKER_01]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I had just collected slowly and
subconsciously was collecting all these
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was looking at my seed stash,
what should I pop?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, huh, I really love
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to jump back into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I popped everything that I had,
not every, not every seed of everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: but every line, seeds of every line and a
good amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could name it, but it's just pretty much
think of every old DJ short line you could
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly think of and every hybrid that
would like, you know, the BC hybrids and
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went through these and I really
wasn't finding anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the lines that I'd been given
was Lone Star's blue bonnet from Bodhi had
[SPEAKER_01]: kept them over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this line, there was a female in it
that was just phenomenally blueberry,
[SPEAKER_01]: phenomenally blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was this male and I don't
usually go by stem rubs, but he,
[SPEAKER_01]: over the years of running blueberry,
even from my first experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned selecting with blueberry,
even in females, there's a purple stripe
[SPEAKER_01]: that runs down some of these stocks and
there's certain traits you can look for
[SPEAKER_01]: that will show you some of the more
blueberry turped expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're lucky, if you're lucky,
it doesn't always denote it, but it
[SPEAKER_01]: denotes it enough to where it's a good
place to start, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all need a starting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was my, in my mind, that was a
starting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was this male in the room that
would raise its fanlies like 85,
[SPEAKER_01]: 80 degrees from top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was, you know, he grew pretty big.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: His fanlies, instead, when I say praying,
like some people think about the top
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves praying, you know, or the top
little sets praying when they're happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was every fanly from the bottom
angled like this, like it's raising its
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking hand straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, wow, he has the purple
stripe stocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: His stem rub smells insanely like
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give this dude a shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm going to try this and see
what this male does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I became more hyper focused on the
male with my females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause at this time I had masked some of my
favorite females in my collection ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of all the, all the clones
getting wiped out, I had to go back and
[SPEAKER_01]: resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during the time I'm popping all these
seeds, I'm also resourcing my whole
[SPEAKER_01]: library from people I got it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a, there's a dude that I
haven't named yet that I absolutely love
[SPEAKER_01]: that I have to bring in at this point,
because he helped me amass my library
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is Matt Elite.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Elite Cannabis, one of my best
friends on earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of those dudes that like really
wants to remain nameless in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's probably going to be annoyed that
I even mentioned him, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he's a beautiful human being and his
sourcing on cuts and him and Dave from
[SPEAKER_01]: Elite Cannabis, their sourcing on cuts was
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: As good as me or CSI or anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he held a lot of the rare chems and
day records.
[SPEAKER_01]: And stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was able to get day record back,
things that I worked with earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the OG cuts, triangle, all that shit I
got back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the chems and Bodhi came, he's like,
he wrote me a message and he's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard you lost your whole library.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be up in a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's literally all he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be up in a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he came up and he dropped off all
these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: He drove them up to me or drug them down,
I should say to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a fucking angel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like this dude, this dude is a
rock star in our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like, he is so busy and he drove
me down clones, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CSI, we had one of our meetups for the
Cantalouminati, which we'll talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: later, little baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we met up and he brought me clones
too, like really rare clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during this blueberry work,
I have amassed one of my best collections
[SPEAKER_01]: ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be, I mean, and it was only because
the community and my friends stepped up
[SPEAKER_01]: and saw what I had lost and knew how
tragic that would be for them and gave me
[SPEAKER_01]: those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, I got a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what he does with this female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the other selections from DJ stuff
were real interesting this round,
[SPEAKER_01]: including one from his blueberry line that
came from seeds resin lung had from one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the lectures DJ gave in California at a
collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had kept these old seeds of flow and
this, and I popped those.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flow really didn't do much.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one blueberry that was semi
blueberry smelling with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: shitty backwater, but it was blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looked like every single cut from
his book that I would have ever wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had the looks and I was wondering if
this male ejecting this male in that line
[SPEAKER_01]: would pull those blueberry dominant genes
out further that blueberry scent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would have a line that looked like
DJs, but smelled like possibly like the
[SPEAKER_01]: blue bonnet, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of this was done on remembering the
stories about Lone Stars, the trait of the
[SPEAKER_01]: purple stocks, the stem rub, and a wing
and a prayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went into this with that,
had all the clones from my buddies
[SPEAKER_01]: re-amassed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the selections from all the
different blueberries and we did our first
[SPEAKER_01]: bonnet run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that male ended up being so good by my
perspective and by a lot of other
[SPEAKER_01]: people's, to be honest, like, and in
saying that, I had very little to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the selection was pure luck and a
little bit of experience, but the work was
[SPEAKER_01]: done by Lone Star and Vic High,
who he got it from and the blueberries he
[SPEAKER_01]: got from him and people before him,
DJ Short even.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I inherited this line,
it did the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just lucky enough that I paid
attention to the traits of him raising his
[SPEAKER_01]: hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like it was kind of like,
I felt like the dude spoke to me in a
[SPEAKER_01]: weird fucked up way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pick me, pick me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I felt from the jump.
[SPEAKER_01]: I genuinely felt that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Word for word, that's what I thought he
was saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it ended up being producing the best
lines, expressions of lines that I have
[SPEAKER_01]: ever seen to date consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: It consistently puts these out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it became- The community is just
reinforcing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and it became this thing where like,
I don't know that I ever want to move on
[SPEAKER_01]: from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's hard because when you find
a male that is true breeding in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: like this and makes consistent stuff,
that is so rare because it's so hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: select male traits in cannabis because
they look different from females and their
[SPEAKER_01]: expressions look different from the same
expression in a female that picking is
[SPEAKER_01]: such a shotgun method that when you find-
It's like you won the lottery,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a lottery ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't, it's not a lottery ticket
in the sense of this is going to make me
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a genetic lottery ticket in the sense
of how it breeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that to me is the most valuable tool,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried to back him up and not only
that, the place that I gave him to,
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, you can share this male with
anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone who wants it can use it because I
feel like it's a valuable breeding tool,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just for injecting blueberry into
lines, but it has a similar like anxiety,
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-anxiety effect and a similar pain
effect to the original riot berry that I
[SPEAKER_01]: had found.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this, this is not just a breeding tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a medical tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I felt like it would be very selfish of
me to sit on this and to not share it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I gave it to a major nursery,
but there it contracted HPLV and was put
[SPEAKER_01]: to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the work that exists with that male
exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the male is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, but I do have more seeds of
the F1, the original seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that I'm hoping that he pops
up enough that he will show up again in
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the F twos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the BX ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've noticed is in these lines,
even in the hybrids, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: bloopers, skunk, resin, cush, any of them,
there is a male and the punchy bluster as
[SPEAKER_01]: well, which is how we select the male.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the punchy bluster stuff for our
newest work, all the males do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every single one of those males breeds
blue traits and blue terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is looking like it's a link trait to
at least it may, the blueberry terps come
[SPEAKER_01]: through even when that trait doesn't show
up, but it for sure shows up when I see
[SPEAKER_01]: that trait and it breeds true when I see
that trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got like a strong
correspondence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correlation and yeah, causation and
correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Type thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to be true across all lines,
which means it's true breeding across all
[SPEAKER_01]: lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's special.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not as upset as I was about losing
the male because I really think you can go
[SPEAKER_01]: through any of these hybrids and select
that trait and find something that will
[SPEAKER_01]: breed just as similar as the male did for
those terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not look, but terps effect and
potency and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the other thing that the blue
bonnet line had that mine never did was
[SPEAKER_01]: extreme recreational potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one of the cuts yesterday or yeah,
someone had the blooper skunk tested
[SPEAKER_01]: yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, diesel does not test high ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 15, 16, um, consistently in,
from places that are more reliable for
[SPEAKER_01]: testing and consistent with their testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he hit me back and he's like,
this line's testing at 27.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, wow, a blueberry that
injects that kind of potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything is so phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're getting results back on the
blue resin Kush that it has, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 7.5% total Terps, 5% Mersene, 5.5% Mersene
in the, in that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, some are 3.5% Mersene,
some are 5% Mersene in small pops,
[SPEAKER_01]: like six seed pops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's breeding true for a lot of
wild extreme traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all, it's almost like,
even if I wanted to move on, because I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel so strong about it's potency,
it's medical relevance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it very hard to move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel the responsibility with it,
even if people don't care, even if it
[SPEAKER_01]: never makes me any money, you know,
cause trying to resell blueberry,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I've talked about is hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have had experiences with DJ
shorts, positive or negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's positive, they're like,
I've already found a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's negative, I've already run
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would I want to run one?
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit's boof.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's a lot of the attitude I
get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it, and it's, it's, I respect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I had that same attitude for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I do want to ask you about,
you know, what the future holds,
[SPEAKER_02]: but this is also a good time for me to ask
one of the questions I got from one of our
[SPEAKER_02]: syndicate members.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a hard question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from, I don't, I've never known how
to say this guy's name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jabs, Zix, JabsYX.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: JabsX asks, if you have one, what's your
favorite expression or plan to have ever
[SPEAKER_02]: popped out of the bonnet work?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to say my favorite- Maybe a top
two or top three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a top, I'll give you a top
three, all for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: The silver pearl blue bonnet, which we
called the cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, because it lets the silver pearl come
through so well with all of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: bonnet traits, except for the berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite expressions in that line are
the strictly silver pearl traits with
[SPEAKER_01]: bonnet potency and bonnet type high,
which is pretty close to the, the silver
[SPEAKER_01]: pearl type high, real quality,
anti-anxiety, not a ton of cerebral,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the dumb mouth stuff that I talk
about, but everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I love the smell of silver pearl.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: A second one would be punchy bluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because I've always really
enjoyed the grape combination with
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry, like the blueberry jam.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you take like a picture, taking grape
jam and combining it with blueberry jam
[SPEAKER_01]: and smelling it like smuckers,
like insane, insane mouthwatering,
[SPEAKER_01]: delicious smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And grape amplifies the blueberry and
blueberry amplifies the grape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of those ones that is just
so extreme and it's so loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Across the board, when you have a room
full of popped punchy bluster seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's mostly all you're smelling in a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you have like other strong cam
zero G's in there that are putting off
[SPEAKER_01]: dank smells, this stuff's so loud,
great blueberry with no skunky smells that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just wild, wild, wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would cut through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cuts through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one for that reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the smell and taste and the
potency is screaming, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's way up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has THC percents that everybody loves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third out of the hybrids would be
the blue resin cush because after seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: the test results of the amount of myrsine,
which is something we know has major
[SPEAKER_01]: medical effects and the THC percentage
with the extracts, I know it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: probably one of the most medically
relevant plants that I've ever,
[SPEAKER_01]: ever had the pleasure of releasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it was a project between me
and my boy resin lung, who I love a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's my boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's a few, few levels of love
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the medical part, I really do think
it's going to be the most medically
[SPEAKER_01]: important plant that I've ever touched.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if that means that it
will be in the future and like people will
[SPEAKER_01]: take hold of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know that the potential is there
for it to be that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I had a few questions to kind of
round out this section on your breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess these are, these are more like
narrow questions or more focused
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: First one I have is, what were some
notable, you know, quote unquote failures
[SPEAKER_02]: or quote unquote dead ends in some of your
work?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first one was a lot of people don't
know this, but like I did auto flower
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding, feminized auto flower breeding
really early.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my main mentors in feminized seeds
who taught me, well, there's a few Shanti
[SPEAKER_01]: Baba was one who taught me how to make
fence seeds and he was resistant to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did not like them at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he let me know that, but he was also
willing to teach me, which was unreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like do you have one of the best breeders
honor teaching you that was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also Ernesto from buddha seed Spain,
who most people don't know his name or his
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think of big Buddha seeds Milo,
but Buddha seeds was from Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people don't know they are
one of the biggest seed companies on
[SPEAKER_01]: earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's not because they're auto
flower work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are one of the resellers of seeds,
meaning not resellers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're one of the major retailers of
seeds in Spain, bulk retailers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the only competition they had for a
long time was like Dynafem, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Mota, but they were one of the first
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before that, and they were retailing like
greenhouse Nirvana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anytime you're buying greenhouse seeds,
you're actually buying seeds from Ernesto
[SPEAKER_01]: during those errors or Nirvana or any of
those places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and he taught me how to make feminine
seeds and he taught me how he was doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: and how he was breeding for auto trades.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started with his work called white
dwarf and it was a white widow crossed to,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe a low rider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two is what he chose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was low rider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he bred that in and made a very,
what we considered potent auto flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I brought this to America.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feminized, I reversed some of his auto
flower, uh, females and we made,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, um, what are we quiet with there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we combined it with low rider one
ourselves, if I remember correctly,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was what we popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was low rider one or two ourselves to
make our line, uh, white rider,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe we called it, which I hate the
name now, if the name is like sounds Nazi
[SPEAKER_01]: ish or something like white, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the name of a Nazi album,
like punk rock album that I didn't even
[SPEAKER_01]: know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, yeah, it's not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a great line for an auto line,
but with this, at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was also popping white or purple widow
from DeShamen seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Ingmar DeShamen's company who made
white widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought like, for sure I was going to
get the best purple widow ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I got was an auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was totally purple from birth,
but because it was totally purple,
[SPEAKER_01]: like from the jump and it wasn't like
environmentally purple and it didn't turn
[SPEAKER_01]: purple later on, which is what most
purples were would turn purple later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a true breeding purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried breeding it into the white rider
because it already had the auto flower
[SPEAKER_01]: trait, which wasn't advertised on the
package ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it had that, I wanted to see if I
could out cross the, or like, in cross
[SPEAKER_01]: that without bringing in the hermit trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had the line purple rider and it was
all herms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all herms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking all auto flowering,
but it was all herms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took it to F3 and released it like
wasted time on this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so that was, that was my worst
line ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without any doubts, I made an auto
flowering true breeding herm without any
[SPEAKER_01]: doubts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the worst line, but there's other
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have a green crack BX1 that I made
using the platinum banana OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: The X1 is the outcross and with green
crack crossed in twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was so far away from green crack by
the BX1 that I just stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just cut the line, killed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave it out to Frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I just didn't release it because
it was so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great line, but like people would
have liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was platinum banana OG though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was not green crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the name was a total misnomer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably could have changed the name and
sold it, but I was so mad that it was so
[SPEAKER_01]: far away from where I wanted it to be that
I was just like screw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bird seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gave it to the bird.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm realistically like I found
some of the packs left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chacha got a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many times like that though.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times it was the BX1s because I
would try to make a BX1 line and not go
[SPEAKER_01]: BX2 or BX3 because to me there's no point
in taking stuff that far.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be able to take it to BX1 lock
in a single trait and that's that if you
[SPEAKER_01]: do it correctly and have a male breeding
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always wanted to make a male
breeding line as opposed to the S1s during
[SPEAKER_01]: a long period because it just got so much
shit for feminized seeds and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody fucking hated me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was locking me out of cuts because I
was making fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started doing the BX1 thing,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a good segue because the next
question is actually from Shawnee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is about fems.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is about reversals because as you've
alluded to, you know, it was quite a
[SPEAKER_02]: controversial thing for you to be doing at
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question I guess from Shawnee is
kind of like taking a slightly different
[SPEAKER_02]: stance and it's like looking back from
where we are now.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did reversals eventually become the
norm?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you could go back, you know,
how would you explain to someone that had
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, more conservative
mentality of why reversals are useful?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did it become the norm?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think because I know about
this is that I know that there are a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of myths that float around that
kind of like trigger slash signal you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the beginning, I guess I got to talk
about the beginning and the myths to start
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the beginning, there was a myth that
feminized seeds, because it's missing a
[SPEAKER_01]: male chromosome, would ruin cannabis,
the genome, the genetics as a whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was a real concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that I was doing GMO work and that I
was going to ruin cannabis because of
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Americans tended to have this attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Dutch had, I didn't notice this
attitude over there except with a few
[SPEAKER_01]: companies like Mr. Nice and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wouldn't be considered Dutch
because by this time he'd moved to
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland, but he wasn't, you know,
Amsterdam for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He carried the attitude of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people also carry this weird,
I don't want to say, I shouldn't say
[SPEAKER_01]: weird, this very religious Christian
mindset that if God, God didn't feminize
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, therefore it's unnatural breeding
and I want nothing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes God doesn't come into play when
they say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just say, this is unnatural and I
want nothing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not organic and I don't want
anything to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the two main mindsets that
were going around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think of many others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Femmes, oh, all Femmes herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the other one, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, cause of my experience with Ingadar,
Ingamarta shamans, which a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: had that experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were buying from Amsterdam and they
were popping feminized seeds and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: getting herms, but the, what they didn't
really take into account was that they
[SPEAKER_01]: were popping regular seeds and getting
herms too at the same rate from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just like specific to Femmes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the myth was set anyways, cause it was
like, Oh, Femmes are new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting herms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Femmes cost more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I bought Femmes expecting better.
[SPEAKER_01]: This sucks, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a lot of that basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: My main argument to like the God community
or the organic community was that in
[SPEAKER_01]: nature, cannabis is an intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wants to be intersex and only
because of humans, human intervention and
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding, we have pushed this plant to try
to choose between male or female.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not natural to push it and to make
it and to breed it towards that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was only done by man and man's
intervention.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using their mindset, technically we are
restoring cannabis back to where it was as
[SPEAKER_01]: an intersex plant onto the missing
chromosomes, destroying cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: All it takes is crossing in a male to a
feminized plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're back to regular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also like there are things called
autosomes that are not the sexual
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosomes of the Xs and Ys that also
control sexual expression in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And trying to explain that to people is
really hard because they don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: understand chromosomes and autosomes in
the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just shits all over that argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's already autosomes controlling
this, which is why in feminized seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have a plant that expresses fully
male with no female traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I'm sorry, yeah, fully male,
no female traits, send it in to be tested
[SPEAKER_01]: and it'll test all female because that's
how cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can express all female without any
female chromosomes because the autosomes
[SPEAKER_01]: are telling you, hey, we need balls here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an issue that people don't take
into account because it's way beyond their
[SPEAKER_01]: comprehension level of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: All femsherm, it's really shit in,
shit out, which a lot of people do
[SPEAKER_01]: understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put in shit, you're going to get out
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have two plants that are
naturally intersex and want to remain
[SPEAKER_01]: intersex and you feminize one or you
feminize that plant and pollinate itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: the likelihood is that its progeny will
have those same traits of being intersex.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not because it's feminized,
it's because it already had them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually because it's feminized,
it actually takes it two generations,
[SPEAKER_01]: not two generations, it takes what would
be several generations of regular
[SPEAKER_01]: inbreeding further in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're getting more of the
recessive traits, including the intersex
[SPEAKER_01]: traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So technically, because it was shit,
it amplifies the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it wasn't shit, it wouldn't be
amplified, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fem seeds can contribute to more of the
herms, but because it was shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you were always going to get the herms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a weird kind of like self
defeatist type model.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're set up to fail in the first place
by what they chose and the genetics you
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: How it became popular, I really just think
that it was over the years of me selling
[SPEAKER_01]: fem spray, people started, their attitudes
changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was funny, I noticed the big
change was when breeders that were shit
[SPEAKER_01]: talking, feminized seeds, majorly started
buying the fem spray off me behind the
[SPEAKER_01]: scenes and started doing it and started
playing with it and realized, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't that hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can make fem seeds and I can charge more
for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things are, these things are fire,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there were breeders like
Canarado, who didn't buy my spray,
[SPEAKER_01]: but saw the advantages of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was a well-known figure who was
really well-liked and in the community
[SPEAKER_01]: already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by him doing feminized seeds,
kind of okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: CSI popped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's super respected.
[SPEAKER_01]: He popped back up, I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was releasing feminized seeds now
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's respected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Ogier Rascal never caught any
flak really for it that I remember because
[SPEAKER_01]: he was scary and intimidating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it just slowly, the attitude
changed to where they weren't people that
[SPEAKER_01]: you could shit talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making fem seeds and more people were
buying the spray and doing it behind the
[SPEAKER_01]: scenes and realizing I can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if I don't have to mix these
chemicals and do all this hard shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do this, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you, you basically provided a
platform for people to actually start
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny thing, you know,
I think about that product of yours and
[SPEAKER_02]: the thing about it is that it's almost too
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like once someone has a bottle of that
stuff, I bet you they don't really have to
[SPEAKER_02]: come back to you for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that became an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm creating competitors too in the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also became an issue of
contention for a lot of the fucking shit
[SPEAKER_00]: talk after the fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my main people that hates my guts
and shit talks me everywhere hates me on
[SPEAKER_01]: the premise that I created competitors for
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, you are arming the enemy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally word for word.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't look at it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, that's the thing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're playing a different game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for a lot for these people,
it's like a zero sum game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas for you, you're just thinking
about how to better equip the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm thinking we're on a level
playing field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they do this for these clones that
they have, maybe they're clones that I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can get those S1s and I can look to
that line finally, because they use my
[SPEAKER_01]: spray and they did it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that's my mindset.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more dank out there for all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another charitable paraphrase of that
is that like you thought it would be
[SPEAKER_02]: mutually beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mutually beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like groups, the way groups work and
the way they thrive best is when
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's mutually beneficial,
because everybody's working for each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't have to be a one to one
type thing like people think all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes mutually beneficial means a
hundred people buy that spray or I give
[SPEAKER_01]: away a hundred bottles of that spray,
which is also the case to other breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, you know, like, you know,
if you like it, if it works for you,
[SPEAKER_01]: just drop me a little ad or like,
say you liked it, make a post with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you loved it and you get to see very
quickly how many people respect that or
[SPEAKER_01]: don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's all kinds of things that are
usually been like it was mutually
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial for me to see that they weren't
good people or that they didn't respect me
[SPEAKER_01]: like I'd hoped.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's mutually beneficial for even
though it cost me money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't so much that I lost the
outweighing of losing that money for
[SPEAKER_01]: shipping and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was worth it to see that this
particular person isn't worth doing
[SPEAKER_01]: business with in the future.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that mutual beneficial to like
benefits come in losses, oddly enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even because information is still a
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: All data is a benefit to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a nerd, if you're a nerd and you
pay attention to shit, all data is a
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even bad data, even erroneous data,
it's still data.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that that was a great, great response
and a great question from Sean as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm glad that he got that in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, OK, zooming out a little bit more and
just thinking now about this last question
[SPEAKER_02]: for the breeding work section,
the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know probably, again, quite a hard
and like very open question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, what what do you think the
future holds for your breeding work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, because I'm so focused on the
syndicate, be it this podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: be it the discord, the Patreon discord or
or or a close friend group.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been focusing more on that and
community building than I have on plants
[SPEAKER_01]: because it takes a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, realistically, it takes a lot of
time, like people don't know how much
[SPEAKER_01]: behind the scenes stuff goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like it isn't even just me,
like guys like Thousand, Shawnee,
[SPEAKER_01]: Crybaby, not so we are working on this
shit all the way more than we probably
[SPEAKER_01]: should.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so like breeding for the future,
a lot of it is going to be collaborative
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff because I feel like this was built
to not only just I didn't want to ever
[SPEAKER_01]: prop myself up with this shit because that
just looks like a used car salesman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I like I was so hesitant to
do the episode in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to prop up friends who maybe are way
better than me at what they do,
[SPEAKER_01]: or at least I feel that way and haven't
gotten the shine because they're quiet or
[SPEAKER_01]: because they don't want to deal with
sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to deal with the drama of
sales because drama comes with sales and
[SPEAKER_01]: having to see company every time people
start hating you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't they don't want to deal with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in doing this, I've spent a lot of time
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my future, like I have the projects,
collaborations with CSI, there's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a big one coming with
not so dog CSI and the syndicate that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to help with.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's going to be big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people have been waiting for not so
released.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the feminized not so released
coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming soon, very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'm stoked on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have I mean, the punchy project I just
did here locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting to teach someone as I teach
someone the blue bonnet traits that come
[SPEAKER_01]: through in the punchy stuff and like
getting to teach on hand, which I I've
[SPEAKER_01]: always been the student.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that that does sum up in
a way like what you're just saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're kind of leaning now towards
other people and kind of like equipping
[SPEAKER_02]: other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, like I realize like.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my livelihood, too, as a seed
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always it's it's been my livelihood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty open about that,
like making money off cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people denounce and decry it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, I really feel like if you're
good to it in the plant and advancing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: like there's not there's not a lot of
disrespect going on there, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also feel like in doing so,
we owe it to build the community forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And saying that is one thing that actions
are way fucking bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watched and waited and waited and I've
never felt like I'm the right person to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this for many reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we haven't gotten to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already like far in on the
controversies, but like we're going to hit
[SPEAKER_02]: their necks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is a good way to segue then,
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I didn't even know if I was the
right person to do this, but no one was
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they were, they were doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel with selfish agendas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though I may I'm not even the
right person to do this because of my rep,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether deserved or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it and I hope someone does it better
even like it's not even like it's not like
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the only one that can happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want everyone to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be so much better if everybody
had syndicates out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say this as like, again,
a relative outsider, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just home growing hobbyist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: As someone who's kind of explored quite a
few of these different communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: I and of course, I'm biased now,
you know, I'm kind of entrenched in the
[SPEAKER_02]: syndicate, but it is by far the most
genuine community like cannabis community
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've found where you can have actual
genuine interactions with other people
[SPEAKER_02]: that are meaningful and that don't have
just this like constant backdrop of
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing and sales, which is what you do
find in many of the other discords and
[SPEAKER_02]: communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sales pumping hard, hard, hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like all the discords are structured
like shirts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shops, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're structured to be a little cult
shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're being real, like little mini cult
shops, like here's me on a pedestal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you what to buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that not only me,
but Shawnee and other moderators,
[SPEAKER_01]: like people that aren't readers,
remind people daily in our in ours because
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to kick over every statue in
cannabis, like not to disrespect,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to for people to realize anyone can
pop a pack of seeds from anyone,
[SPEAKER_01]: not from me, from anyone, even idiots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like you could buy seeds from
idiots and pop a pack of seeds and find
[SPEAKER_01]: something that is as good as any elite cut
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's anybody can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can educate yourself better to have
better chances at finding a good breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: who does actual work that has the real
clone that you want with the traits you
[SPEAKER_01]: want.
[SPEAKER_01]: That increases your odds and probably a
better way of spending money and your your
[SPEAKER_01]: investments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anybody can pop anything any time
that's equally as good as anything that I
[SPEAKER_01]: found.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we want to reinforce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pedestals, they lead to nothing but
disappointment, you know, because no one's
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people are assholes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most breeders that like flex like they're
rich and like you want to be like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not, you know, like that's a
that's a smoke of mirrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: These aren't those days of rich breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that no, that's a really nice kind
of statement about, you know, at least
[SPEAKER_02]: part of your mission with the syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll come back to it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: For right now, you know, I didn't want to
ask you, you did mention it already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you think, you know, you are such a
divisive figure?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what's happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't know any of these
specific events, but do you want to speak
[SPEAKER_02]: to any of the controversies set by the
people?
[SPEAKER_01]: So all my life, I can't even say all my
life after second grade probably is when I
[SPEAKER_01]: became a little bit of a I don't say a
monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe maybe some people might apply
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I the word polarizing has been used to
describe me my whole life, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: through high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adults used it a lot in high school in
regards to me because I would push every
[SPEAKER_01]: button and push every boundary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would fight a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was a short kid, so I had a
big mouth and that big mouth would make me
[SPEAKER_01]: fight a lot like I didn't really like
fighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to get into fights,
but because of my mouth, I had to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just it's one of those things like
some people are on different spectrums,
[SPEAKER_01]: and my spectrum is very little filter and
I blame it on a head injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but yeah, I know I've always had that
title of being a polarizing figure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I came into cannabis,
it was no different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was a basically a punk rock guy
trying to bring those ideals into the
[SPEAKER_01]: Grateful Dead type community or in some
cases, the hip hop rap dab type community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was seeing a lot wrong on forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was seeing people say things that
weren't true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was seeing people openly lie to each
other and stab each other in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do nasty shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'd say something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And early on, I realized the most common
response is, oh, man, bad vibes,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you bringing bad vibes here?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, hey, man, we know all that
bad vibes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that was that was really what I
got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this and.
[SPEAKER_01]: These forums, I mean, people again,
I talk about this all the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: but people nowadays trying to back read
the forums can't unless you're really good
[SPEAKER_01]: at using the way back machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these like clandestine forums
are gone, like not even on that site.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't big enough for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they weren't being indexed.
[SPEAKER_01]: On these sites, there were mostly seed
banks and seed bank owners, as we were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about, had agendas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like like on the discords.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you spoke out against anyone or said
anything about anyone, including them on
[SPEAKER_01]: their forum, you're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I seem to think that I was going to be
immune to this or something, or maybe I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I really genuinely don't remember
what I was thinking at the time or why I
[SPEAKER_01]: think it was just emotional reactions to
like, this isn't fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is this person getting fucked over or
why did you keep my money?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I sent it to you, I'm going to tell
people this so that they don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing happen to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kept my money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or any number of things, you know,
like this breeder fucked over my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, why are you selling their seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you a scumbag, too?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was pretty much removed from every
forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the biggest, I think, things that
is stuck that drives me the nuttiest is a
[SPEAKER_01]: story about the the black dog,
sorry, the blood rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my buddies, I had a buddy named Skunko
from Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a wonderful dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biggest heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: His sister was going through chemotherapy
at the time, and I had given him a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds that I had made early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it helped her.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot tremendously, he said, and I didn't
ask for anything for it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just whatever or friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about three years later, he had gotten
a bunch of seeds of this line called Black
[SPEAKER_01]: Rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had gotten them from a dude named Heath
Robinson called Black Rose, and I had
[SPEAKER_01]: given them to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tons of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think like 80 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he made a bunch of crosses with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, dude, I want to give these
to you because what you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, no, like people that know
me, like anybody that knows me,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially now that is a friend,
I'll say, no, I'm not going to keep your
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get money for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting half because that's how it
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half is what I don't work any other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not not only because I feel like I'm a
generous dude, I feel like I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: that leads to resentment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people aren't if everything's not 100
percent or like even it will always lead
[SPEAKER_01]: to resentment or potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't like losing friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I want everybody to feel like we're
all on the same page.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm making money, you're making as much
as me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he sent me the pictures for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is when I just started working
with the attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just started working with the attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got the seeds, put up the pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I should say, that was a big deal at
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, I was I was the second American
ever on the attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're on the attitude, it was like
making it in high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was me and sub cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to hit up the attitude when so I'm
sorry, Heath Robinson went on the
[SPEAKER_01]: attitude, saw those pictures like those
are my picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, Stumco.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, well, it looked like the mom,
the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh, brother, because he
didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's not a writer.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't all over Heath Robinson's
pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know every single picture of his
and every single one of these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an effort, which very uniform and
magenta.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all look the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I was like, OK, take it down now
and put up a thing saying this is
[SPEAKER_01]: Robinson's this picture, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will have pictures when it comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was all done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heath is pissed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heath is nine shades of pissed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes on and rants and raves on
forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to this day, Matt is a picture thief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt is a clone thief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like and it was up for probably three
hours.
That's fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for that three hours, it's been 15
years of Matt is a picture thief and clone
[SPEAKER_01]: thief.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I'm not going to blame it on
Skunko.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have done the the work because I
knew Heath, I should have I guess I should
[SPEAKER_01]: have asked him, are these pictures yours?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I never would have assumed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, no, but that's like an unknown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you didn't know you didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I didn't know that Skunko didn't even
know that wasn't what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because and the thing is, in fairness to
Skunko, that's what people did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put up pictures of their mom plants
as the seed plant saying this is a mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Expect to get something like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what people did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured that's what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, anyways, yeah, that's the Heath
Robinson controversy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Early on, when I got the seeds,
I gave him I'm sorry, I gave his buddy
[SPEAKER_01]: this is where it gets kooky, real kooky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave his buddy this guy, Nutella on
mechanic cabana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave his buddy a bunch of it was the
very last of my Apollo 13 seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he got is something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wanted it was something very rare
that he wanted Brothers Grimm was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no Apollo 13 sub cool hadn't
made Apollo 13 BX one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all there was.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted him so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, hey, I'm friends with Heath
Robinson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you like purples.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get you a bunch of those seeds,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, all right, well, fine here,
take them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he sent me the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he had the idea that he had gifted me
these and I had done nothing with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I had not sent him anything back.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my mind, I traded his friends for those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a fucking thief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who did all this?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't reciprocate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I didn't reciprocate and then use
this picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I say perspective is everything,
I get his perspective is because he wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: informed and we never spoke after because
he lost his shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I'm the person I am,
I was like, you don't know the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: You right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was bad on my part because I didn't do
my due diligence, which I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was granted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it would have been a lot of due
diligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, I didn't react the way I should
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I mean, it was a very easy
explanation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I felt at the time, if I explain that
I'm going to be throwing skunko under the
[SPEAKER_01]: bus.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a very sweet person, not a breeder,
has no drama in his life and doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: deserve that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all to placate someone who's been an
asshole to me and actually his crew got
[SPEAKER_01]: something and maybe his best friends lying
to him and telling him I didn't get
[SPEAKER_01]: anything, but that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm thinking you're an asshole and you
roll with assholes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that's that's literally the whole
basis for every clone thief, clone this
[SPEAKER_01]: clone that he stole this from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not.
That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a nutshell, and when I talk about me
and ResDog having the dark mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true, like I really, really truly
believe that there is no one else who has
[SPEAKER_01]: the shit stain on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you mention their name,
except for me and ResDog and ResDog
[SPEAKER_01]: actually snitched on people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is my dark mark is the Heath
Robinson Black Rose Fiasco.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's bizarre to me because,
you know, I've never heard that story
[SPEAKER_02]: before, but it just seemed like these
really in the end, quite I know they're
[SPEAKER_02]: not small, but, you know, kind of small
things that just add up in quite a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that last like three hours,
like and I didn't even know attitude and
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the first step with the
attitude where I was like, I got to take
[SPEAKER_01]: these pictures down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second thing that happened was Subcool
went to them because me and Subcool were
[SPEAKER_01]: not super friendly, but we didn't like
fight yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't friendly, but he did not like
that another American was on the attitude
[SPEAKER_01]: with him at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anybody knows Monte or knew Monte,
this was Monte.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he went to, I see her name was Natalia
that owned the attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she still owns it at the time and
said, Matthew Riot is a bad fucking person
[SPEAKER_01]: and you shouldn't do business with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she actually showed me the screenshot
of the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, you know, we go to parties
with Subcool.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's our biggest moneymaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe him.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he says you're a piece of shit,
then I trust this man and we're not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to do any more business with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this time I was making, this is when I
was making serious money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once he, it's like, that was the first
time I'd made serious money.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you make it to the attitude,
you can make serious money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that I was doing that and I felt
like I had finally made it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we were helping my grandma with her,
her nursing home bills at the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: because she had been in a, in a meta,
like a really nice one.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't want me taking care of her
growing weed, you know, so she didn't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a house where weed is grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's an old Mexican lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, where was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about the controversies.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian brought me in some, and I was like,
what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got all distracted with my
ADHD.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were essentially telling us about the
attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the attitude.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drama.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he said, you know, oh, so I was helping
take care of my grandma at her nursing
[SPEAKER_01]: home with money at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really secure, I thought,
because like I had this great
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship, they were buying seeds and
that came to a fucking sudden halt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it caused a lot, like livelihood wise,
like I had to sell her house to pay for
[SPEAKER_01]: her medical bills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Brian, she wasn't living there,
but this is the family's house now,
[SPEAKER_01]: that had to get sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole time I had to hear her cry
about wanting to go home and there was no
[SPEAKER_01]: home to go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was for me, like that rage that I
had for sub cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just like compounding shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, and I shit you not after I got
released from the attitude, it was going
[SPEAKER_01]: from making like 10,000 a week to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made $75 over the period of the next
four months because me getting removed
[SPEAKER_01]: from the attitude meant everybody saw it
and it confirmed that everyone thought
[SPEAKER_01]: that I was a shit bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was public, you know,
like then seeing that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: My God.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, it was, it was
devastating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause this is not even, this is during the
Heath Robinson thing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like just.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compounded compounded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably when I became the most
hateful and the most mean possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, dude, all of these people
think I'm an asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them think I'm a shit bag heel.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all think I'm a bad person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be the worst heel they can fucking
imagine, you know, like, and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: make the best stuff I can while I'm doing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be the worst fucking heel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every con artist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to figure out everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's fucking done every dirty
fucking deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need all these assholes,
you know, that are pulling shit on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to figure out everything they've
ever done genetically and fucking press
[SPEAKER_01]: them up against the wall and make them
fucking pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like the, the origin of the like
anti-hero slash villain arc.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, this is the origin of Matt riot
proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, I had that namer since I was a
little kid in punk bands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my best friend's sister, who was a
riot girl back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like a feminist punk rock
organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm political.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be real like a chauvinist little
pig doer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she'd call me a riot boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I was being a chauvinist pig is the
opposite of a riot girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she called me a riot boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why that name stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the genesis of that name in
cannabis and why like heel is associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with that name.
[SPEAKER_01]: That those months and granted at first I
was getting kicked off forms and pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is when I was like, uh,
no, like I'm going to get the best at
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I possibly can to where my, I'm not
throwing breaks from a glass house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm never going to make these mistakes
like this again, ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to fucking nail all of them
to the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every last one, including sub cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I felt like it was done to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little bit of victim mentality,
which is stupid because reality,
[SPEAKER_01]: like there are things I could have done to
probably have a better reputation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have kissed his ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have been nice to sub cool despite
not liking him and everything would have
[SPEAKER_01]: been probably hunky dory, but I mean
hindsight, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I didn't need to be me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't need to question everyone at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people were successful cause they
didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it probably would have been
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not the way, the way I was
thinking at the time was you did this to
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that had to change in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a while to change.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I didn't want to ask you about that
next, which was like, what was that period
[SPEAKER_02]: like of like recovering, getting back on
your feet after this?
[SPEAKER_01]: It took all the way up until probably
Instagram came.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people fucking hated my guts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even kidding you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it just every, every day I would have
email saying like, Hey, I heard you're an
[SPEAKER_01]: asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me why you're not?
[SPEAKER_01]: And my first response is, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to politics for your likes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you weren't around during that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first words to me are,
I heard you're an asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get a response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was daily everyone just,
so I didn't make a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never made a lot of money in cannabis
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the last time I made great money
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I got to breed anyways, and I
managed, but once Instagram came around
[SPEAKER_01]: and live streaming happened, I was able to
go on live streams and people were able to
[SPEAKER_01]: ask me questions directly and see my face,
see my mannerisms, hear my words.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some reason that changed a lot,
not everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been very slow, but it did change
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's still happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's still happening as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, and to me, that's a very
slow change, but you know, I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: why I guess be, and the way I looked at it
was I'm going to do this because I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: see any other breeders doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're confident at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I do this and I speak confidently,
hopefully people will learn enough to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to then ask breeders the right
questions to get them to put their feet to
[SPEAKER_01]: the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another, another take I have on this is
that your strategy kind of shifted to just
[SPEAKER_02]: being like, look, I'm just going to like
do the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and, and that was the part of the
heel thing too, is like, I'm just going to
[SPEAKER_01]: work as hard as I can and fuck you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll let the work, you're going to let
the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the work do the talking.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, that's the best I could do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a good point to segue then,
because I was going to ask you next,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the next section is going to be
about returning to that sense of community
[SPEAKER_02]: spirit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think one thing that I is obvious to
me in talking to you today is that your
[SPEAKER_02]: ties to the community are pervasive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you, you know, whether for good or
bad, you've always been interested and
[SPEAKER_02]: invested in community relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the furniture cannabis, I don't go
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad furniture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's, someone's lazy boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've built this thing called breeder
syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you didn't mention,
you didn't name drop this thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I'm not, I don't know if it's a meme
or not, the Canna Luminati, but how did
[SPEAKER_02]: you come up with the idea for the
syndicate?
[SPEAKER_02]: When did you meet not so like how,
you know, what were these events like?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably skip one part and then we'll
go straight into the syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did I meet not so he was,
he was good friends with CSI and CSI knew
[SPEAKER_01]: him as the Mendo purpose guy for years,
like going to old parties in Mendo and
[SPEAKER_01]: back to, back to the NCGA parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't know about and
events.
[SPEAKER_01]: He met not so dog there in Mendo and not
so dog was of course known as the chem 91
[SPEAKER_01]: bucking Mendo purpose guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one day I get a message on Instagram
from a dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, Hey, I heard you got this
Afghani clumps skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we start talking and the guy's super
nice and super competent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, who is this guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I asked Caleb, Hey, have you ever heard
of this dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, yeah, it's my buddy as my boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a Mendo purpose guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course not so hadn't mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the Mendo purpose guy that he's had
anything to do with chem.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just some normal dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask me questions about Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not on the forefront.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't put that in the forefront back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I start having more deep
conversations with him and the guy's just
[SPEAKER_01]: an amazing talker and only that like he's
got amazing things to say and amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during this time discord popped up and
I was on one from someone else had
[SPEAKER_01]: created.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I brought, I was like, Hey,
I have a friend named not so dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think everybody should hear him
talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do a voice chat for the first time
and let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see how people react to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think he's got an interesting story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the first time I interviewed
not so unrecorded for three hours on a
[SPEAKER_01]: discord called the Northwest 47 back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it's called today or if
it's even existing, but yeah, that was the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time I interviewed not so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I realized me and this guy
have chemistry and maybe we should do this
[SPEAKER_01]: more often and talk about other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You start dating.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started dating.
[SPEAKER_01]: We became boyfriends and he was a good
kisser and it was just the way he held me
[SPEAKER_01]: so tight at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chemistry body chemistry and maybe
it's his pheromones, something about it
[SPEAKER_01]: drove me to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you meant not so, and then when did the
syndicate concept arise?
[SPEAKER_01]: The syndicate concept kind of raised early
on when I realized that me not so CSI,
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's not going to have retirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there are people above me that were
getting sick, older people getting sick
[SPEAKER_01]: and had nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, we need a union guys,
something like thinking like totally out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the box, like impossibly maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was the first idea of the
syndicate was just like, this has to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then slowly our friend group started
getting bigger and bigger and there was
[SPEAKER_01]: more interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like, we all started talking
about strains and history and bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: what we had to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it became a 24 seven thing on our own
little area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this group formed and we'd all decided
that it was time to try to take this
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when we started doing breeder
syndicate podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we just kind of fumbled our way
through this and made it here after,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how long it's been a few
years, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long has it been?
[SPEAKER_02]: I, um, yeah, I've never known that
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume it's like three to four years,
something like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that was, you know, you mentioned
thinking about the livelihoods and the
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainability of, uh, breeders and
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and cause my next question was going
to be, you know, what is your hope for
[SPEAKER_02]: this group of people?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your hope for the syndicate?
[SPEAKER_01]: The ultimate goal for the syndicate would
be for everybody that the legacy farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, to be taking care of with some
kind of union.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know how that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how it happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to, I want everyone to have
healthcare.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want everyone to have the same thing
that everybody else should have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I want, I, I like there to be a place
where people can go where they know people
[SPEAKER_01]: have at least done their due diligence to
find the history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And have that accessible and not be just
agenda filled history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been, that's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hard because when you're,
when you make money in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's going to assume that you're
doing it for selfish reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause a lot of those people are selfish
and would do it for selfish reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't understand why they can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but maybe part of that spectrum side
is what brought a lot of us together too,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we were all so narrowly focused in
ADHD on making sure we get this history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That that's the one thing a lot of us gel
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like our overall love falls for
getting this right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And misinformation just absolutely makes
my stomach hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, it's some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's some of my OCD that just inherently
makes me want to push.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it is that I love these people,
my friends, I absolutely love them and I
[SPEAKER_01]: want them to do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see a lot of shitbags progressing
cannabis and I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand why and how that's happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand how to fix that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't see anybody else really
giving it a try.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was my best attempt at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I still got others trying this at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's trying, but the people that have
stepped up, whether it be you,
[SPEAKER_01]: Shawnee, not so, uh, goat farm,
high and lonesome, bitter, Denali,
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody is EB.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, it's, it's, it's been
necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: For everybody to be a part of,
for it to get where it's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like, I don't like talking about me
starting anything because it wasn't me
[SPEAKER_01]: that started it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It formed and became it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just came up with the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll say that it emerged, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It emerged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely emerged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really special to hear because
I don't, I'm sure you've alluded and
[SPEAKER_02]: implied a lot of these things when we
took, when, you know, in other podcasts
[SPEAKER_02]: and in our chats and stuff, but I think
it's really cool to kind of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, hear you talk about what your
hopes are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And was there anything else you wanted to
mention about the syndicate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cause otherwise I think we can kind of
move towards wrapping up with a few like,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, lighter, quicker questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the syndicate, like it's probably
the thing I, when I have a pride of
[SPEAKER_01]: anything, it may not be breeding,
but the fact that this is forming and that
[SPEAKER_01]: when I'm gone, I'm hoping it'll still be
here and people will take the reins or if
[SPEAKER_01]: I retire or whatever, I'm hoping people
take the reins of it because these are
[SPEAKER_01]: such beautiful people that have assembled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I have any pride or anything,
it's going to be with that, the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that have all come together and that I had
any part in that, whether it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: choosing the name and that, you know,
or doing the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I had any part in that,
that's going to be my pride.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I love the bonnet work and I love,
I love cannabis and I love what I've done
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I love this a lot and I'm more proud
of this because in cannabis, everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: else, I just consider everything I've
done, everybody else's.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be proud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's I, I'm, you know, I know again,
like I'm no one in cannabis world and
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have any aspirations of being
anyone, but again, even as like just an
[SPEAKER_02]: enthusiast at home, like it's been such a
special experience and yeah, such a
[SPEAKER_02]: special place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the discord Patreon is one of
the things that were like early on,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, God, I don't want to charge
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the one thing I did not want to
do is charge people for info.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of getting into the discord
Patreon is paying $5 to get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was really resistant to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hated the idea, absolutely hated the
idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I realized like, if we do this,
we ha in order for it to succeed,
[SPEAKER_01]: it has to get bigger, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't just be us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to do that, I'd have to ring
in new people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it, if I felt like if I opened the
flood gates, $5 would be enough of a
[SPEAKER_01]: barrier to keep out people who come in
just to fight and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was very effective at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very effective at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while I regret having to charge anyone
for anything on that, level at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time, because of that, it seems like
everybody's happy to pay that to keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: idiots out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so it did work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's effective as far as keeping trolls
out people, people going there just to
[SPEAKER_01]: cause problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a while we opened it up for free
to see how it went.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we gained a lot of new people by doing
that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really passionate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the discord has been a great place for
everyone to kind of like commune,
[SPEAKER_01]: find each other and really start digging
into history in ways that I think they
[SPEAKER_01]: probably never have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really feel in ways that have never
been offered for cannabis community ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been a part of most of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, you know, in this conversation
today, what I love is that in many ways
[SPEAKER_02]: we've come full circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you, you started with the community
spirit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're still there with the syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've carried that on really strongly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course it was great, of course,
to hear all your breeding work,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's so cool to hear about this side
of things, the community side,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I don't know if I've encountered
another figure in this scene who is as
[SPEAKER_02]: community minded as you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes it so ironic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes those controversies so ironic in
that context.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, there are a lot of people who
have joined over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've learned like when I, when these
people like hit me up in DMS and are like
[SPEAKER_01]: nasty and ugly to me, I just usually say,
I'll see you in three years, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're still around, I'll see you in
three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without it, without fail, dude,
I've gotten so many messages like,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro, I am sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, cause usually if I say that I go
through the shit and I see the working
[SPEAKER_01]: with the scammer and I'm like,
Hey man, I'll tell you what in three
[SPEAKER_01]: years, you're going to find out this
dude's a scammer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you do, will you come back to me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, say shit like that almost
without fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people get it over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the, with the propaganda pushback was
and why it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, like realistically,
like my mission in life, isn't just to
[SPEAKER_01]: make the syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was to get misinformation out of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way to do that is to hold
people's feet to the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by doing that, I did that to
individual people over a period of 17
[SPEAKER_01]: years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've amassed an army of people that
fucking hate my guts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like people in the syndicate have
actually watched this happen many times
[SPEAKER_01]: over now cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: These people pop up, make shit up and
fight, you know, and I've learned to deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with it a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, because it helps when
there's more people than just me to
[SPEAKER_01]: witness the craziness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause for a long time, there wasn't
anybody, but more than me because people
[SPEAKER_01]: were terrified to associate with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would, people would harass friends of
mine that weren't even breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would just harass them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you couldn't even, you could not
post and grow riot seed stuff on forums
[SPEAKER_01]: because people would harass you off the
forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like every time people had nothing to do
with me, we'd get harassed for growing my
[SPEAKER_01]: shit and showing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So times have changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got your back a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very weird to have, like,
I mean, you see it when I get sick,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm like, I've got to fucking
get back to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's hard to remember that there's
other people that like care as much as I
[SPEAKER_01]: do now that can run with it and can carry
balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that sounded bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was super special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, we kind of like to me,
we've kind of covered the bulk of like the
[SPEAKER_02]: critical questions that I wanted to ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say they're like, I've maybe got
another 20 to 30 minutes tops and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, I've got a few community questions
that kind of didn't necessarily fit
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere, but they're still pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's nail them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so one is the one that I had for you,
which is, you know, I've said this to you
[SPEAKER_02]: in private that like, I think part of the
direction change that you've experienced
[SPEAKER_02]: in the last couple of years, you're
actually becoming more and more of like an
[SPEAKER_02]: archivist journalist type.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you don't, you wouldn't maybe
consider that yourself, but I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I, a poor man's.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess in terms of like the
investigations, you know, are there any,
[SPEAKER_02]: any other major lines or names that are
still kind of like at the back of your
[SPEAKER_02]: mind, they're like, I want to get to the
bottom of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any, you know, there there's a
few, um, G 13 only because I'm like five,
[SPEAKER_01]: six of the way there and no bunch of it,
but someone is secret squirreling the last
[SPEAKER_01]: part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically gatekeeping that info from
getting out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he was just making shorts of some of
the hash plant discussions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically like he went and talked to
the guy and no one's allowed to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: what he found because he wants to one day,
maybe do something with it, like a book or
[SPEAKER_01]: something, maybe one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find that extremely selfish and
cowardly and just like little bit shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, Romulan was a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's so much myth around it and
trying to go and track down Romulan Joe,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so much myth around him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one that I've wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, maybe one day we'll see that,
um, you know, what's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned archivists and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, very recently, one of my old close
friends from like junior high,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was a skater kid that we used to
skate and smoke pot together in junior
[SPEAKER_01]: high out, but you know, um, he hit me up
and he still smokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's into a strain stuff, but he worked
for dream work studio as an archivist and
[SPEAKER_01]: now works for a major university.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's so good at his job that they,
he gets paid sabbaticals for two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: months during summer to go archive
whatever he wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to do serious stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this stuff in his stuff is presented
at the library of Congress and these big
[SPEAKER_01]: displays and museums and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's serious stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wants to do one on the history of
punk rock and Baker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sheldt when I was a big figure in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wants to cover cannabis maybe
eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like to get like the cannabis history
covered and displayed in the library of
[SPEAKER_01]: Congress, that would be so huge to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wouldn't be my work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be because he's a real archivist
and anthropologist and does this for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like to be even a part of that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he's going to need people like
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why he reached out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gone so far in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's juicy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my first time hearing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, next question from PBJ girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is something that you wish you knew
before you started breeding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be first not to be so aggressive
with pulling info to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, the name drop thing from Caleb
CSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't name drop people when you first meet
people because you never know what their
[SPEAKER_01]: feelings are truly going to be about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would I would have learned about the
Spanish bait and switch earlier that
[SPEAKER_01]: everything you're buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything you're buying from Amsterdam
comes from Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably not going to be what's
on the packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally speaking, people are fucking
liars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the plants, not the people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Critical thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Critical thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Critical thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Confront your own biases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Critical thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another good one from PBJ girl,
a bit more personal.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you weren't a musician and you weren't
a breeder, what do you think you'd end up
[SPEAKER_02]: doing in an alternate universe?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my my in Canada or in high school,
I wanted to brew beer for a living,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I don't feel I'm too far off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like not so far off even in the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in the same family of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wanted to bring beer for a living.
[SPEAKER_01]: Art probably would be another one,
even though I suck at art.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I was better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I was going to be a musician
growing up, but I'm not, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like professionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that I would love that life
after watching my friends and friends that
[SPEAKER_01]: live that life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to succeed only if you have like
majorly succeeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hard life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're traveling constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not good at much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when people say that, it's like,
oh, no, I'm really not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't I like reading a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I have my UFO stuff that I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't I talk about sometimes on the
show and I even had a podcast for a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like as much as I archive in cannabis,
I probably have archived three times as
[SPEAKER_01]: much in ufology and have studied it more
than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was always my main obsession up
until even the past few years that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: decided I'm done with ufology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can see that it comes from the same
place, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dude, the same type of characters show
up in ufology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they even look like the person.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sound like the person and they act
like the person, but they have different
[SPEAKER_01]: names.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess like in these kind of like
marginal, like opaque worlds of like
[SPEAKER_02]: weird, like uncertain information,
you might get some of the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They even look the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have a final question and it's
kind of like one of those like fantasy
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I it's from Hippie Stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, OK, I'm sorry, they I don't I
don't actually know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to know what your ultimate
fantasy breeding project would look like
[SPEAKER_02]: if you had access to any cut or seed line
from anywhere or anyone through cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: history.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe because you've already kind of
spoken about the potential of blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we just exclude blueberry entirely
from this from this like hypothetical
[SPEAKER_02]: project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had the chance to go back in history,
I would work with my old friend Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: And.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would find out what Afghan tea was and I
would see if I was right about super
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be to to settle the question on
super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it is the is the Afghan tea?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the best skunkiest representation of
super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that what we're finding in the G's
old KMD stuff like that is all Afghan tea
[SPEAKER_01]: representations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd like to know more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one line, one cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Line even in the in what was called the
Maple Leaf Indica that I would like to
[SPEAKER_01]: find more out about.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me up at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that because instead of like
choosing something to actually like like
[SPEAKER_02]: work with or work with in a new way,
you've chosen to be like, no, I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: confirm information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just confirming data like data
points that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like to me, it's the equivalent of
like, is there life on other worlds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, did Jesus exist or any one
of those?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, did I get super skunk,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I right about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my life's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it keeps me up at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and not so has spent more hours on the
phone and online talking about this one
[SPEAKER_01]: single thing than anything like count days
worth of hours talking about this month's
[SPEAKER_01]: worth of hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of those things like with
breeding projects, like I did really think
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I think I could pretty much source
whatever I need to make whatever turf I
[SPEAKER_01]: want or need in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I really set my mind to it and had
the years and the time and finances,
[SPEAKER_01]: I could probably do it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But finding out what something was that's
missing from history.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I got this one right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not usually that confident about
stuff, but I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty confident on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm right about this, it means a
lot of people lied and I can correct a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the questions I've got for you
today, Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like I think is an excellent even
part one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody else wants to go back and touch
on stuff, this is thorough as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, thank you for the opportunity
and thank you for like all the stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I know, like I don't represent
anyone in saying that, but in a way I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that many other people are grateful
for so much of this, so much of the
[SPEAKER_02]: syndicate, so much of the work that you've
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still at this moment right now,
absolutely bizarre to me that I just got
[SPEAKER_02]: to do this conversation with you,
this interview with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it also the fact that I am
here talking to you like this,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think also in a way embodies that
community spirit of yours where you're
[SPEAKER_02]: like, no, anyone can have the chance to do
this.
Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think interviewing me doesn't feel
very special to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it doesn't feel like a special event,
but I felt like I felt like your questions
[SPEAKER_01]: are really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like how you speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, realistically, I just I never
really felt the need to interview me ever
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've never done it on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never ever need my interviews on the
show like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just I felt like I didn't need to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I felt like it would be bad for me to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were the only one that really,
really took the reins and really made it
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're so welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, going back to those
feelings of like, do I really want an
[SPEAKER_02]: interview of myself?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it goes back to something we were
talking about earlier, which is that like,
[SPEAKER_02]: at a point, this becomes bigger than you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and in a way, it's it's it's
bigger than your feelings about yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I know that that's really
hard sometimes to actually stomach.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm going to force you to edit this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I think, yeah, this is
super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

people that have been in the scene forever
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're friends with.

[SPEAKER_01]: This mission isn't about who knows
genetics the best or who can speak the
[SPEAKER_01]: best with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only about heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only about heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the people I want around me or
people with good hearts has nothing.
