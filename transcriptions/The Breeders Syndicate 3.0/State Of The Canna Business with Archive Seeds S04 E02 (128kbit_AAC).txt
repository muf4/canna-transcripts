[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_02]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who live it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-so-Dogs, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got any new news, anything good you
can share with the public?
[SPEAKER_00]: Share with the public, not quite yet,
but not quite yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I am going on a... We'll have
to actually see about next week because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going on that adventure to... Which
one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to find some long-lost
cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going on the adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going on the adventure, I think,
next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, one of our buddies is going to be
super happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I might even be able to get lunch
with him or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I hope you get it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it works out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are going to chat today about a
pretty wide topic, but people have been
[SPEAKER_00]: asking a lot about it, which is sort of
like the whole like hash plant topic,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's met different things at
different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of old, famous hash
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of breeding that got
bred into those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a lot of new modern ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and new modern plants for hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, not only... And by modern,
I mean like even like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a whole new round of named cuts
that got, you know, hash plant labels or
[SPEAKER_03]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now hash plant actually means
something totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we're going to kind of talk
widely about hash plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever have any hash plant
questions or anything along those lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: today's a great day to shoot them and see
what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got all the catalogs ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got illustrations ready of said hash
plants, most of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I even went back and because there was
one hash plant I thought of that nobody
[SPEAKER_02]: ever really mentions anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for a while in the like the 08,
09 era, it was pretty popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the cuttlefish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I even dug up info on the old
cuttlefish hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old cuttlefish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we're going to go over as many as
we can remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: As many as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we're going to talk about the
history of hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about a bunch of
specific cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can ask away about specific cuts
they're interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Matt just said, he's got a list.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like maybe the term hash plant you
know, just to start, right, is kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: weird term because all Afghans back then
pretty much bred and grown for hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then some strains got called hash
plant and some strains got called other
[SPEAKER_00]: names.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do we know that was Neville the first
one to name a strain or did it come over
[SPEAKER_02]: that way with that name and then he used
the name?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the only thing that we know
about like the G13 and the PNW hash plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is that Neville says he bought them in
Oregon through friends of Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jorge confirmed that, you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know the origin stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I assume he just called it what he got
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I assume so, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where where the name evolved.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be nice to ask Jorge,
but I don't know if he would know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's weird because it's like
essentially like hash plants started off
[SPEAKER_00]: as basically being any Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they were all that's what
marijuana was grown for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was to make hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people started bringing over all
these Afghans or hash plants or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these various different things over to
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we talked about this a
bunch, but crossing them with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: different sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is is kind of that's kind of that's kind
of the beginning of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's this is I get probably jump the
gun on showing this one is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, that's not it's not terribly
jumping the gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened is, is that a bunch of
people started bringing over these Afghans
[SPEAKER_00]: because they wanted to add bigger,
chunkier buds to their sativas and they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted their sativas to finish earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Afghanistan is a super different
climate than over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of these hash plants or Afghans
that they brought over, they just rotted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just they just read in terrible rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the vast majority of the seeds that
people brought over ended up being not
[SPEAKER_00]: that useful.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people would go and get their sativas
seeds from before they bred that Indica
[SPEAKER_00]: into it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're so early on, early on the
big hunt for hash plants or the big hunt
[SPEAKER_00]: for Afghans was ones that didn't rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of why I think some of
these cuttings became so popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, because most, you know,
most of the breeding that got done just
[SPEAKER_00]: got done with specific moms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once you found one that did that,
you traded it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how they did over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so there's an aspect where it's like
Neville went and, you know, Neville even
[SPEAKER_00]: said that, like, because Matt held up his
his catalog or whatever, all that hunting
[SPEAKER_00]: that Neville did in Afghanistan,
he said, regrettably, like those those
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghans weren't as nice as some of the
clone onlys he got sent over from America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether that was Big Bud or the Pacific
Northwest Hash Plant or the G13 or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some of the cuttings that he
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these cuttings that did well,
you know, the NL five, all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: things start getting passed around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Neville probably would met with
matches held up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville probably made it really famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hash plant pure by he crossed
the hash plant to like the G13 and the NL
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he and then he took a G13 NL one and
he back crossed it to the hash plant
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what Matt was showing that ugly
squat thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash plant pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is the hash plant here,
which I mean, you know, there is debate on
[SPEAKER_02]: whether the PNW hash plant that exists
today is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But looking at this and granted,
you know, different growing environments,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else, I would be hard pressed
to say this looks anything like the cut
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors grown here of the PNW.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't know it looks like it sure does
look puckish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say it looks like the the hash
plant cut that gets passed around either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But boy, does it look like some ugly puck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sure does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bud formation and all that type of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's weird, maybe I should say
this before we move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's weird about what we did right is
someone just asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Afghan is hash plant now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Afghan people grew Afghans to make
into hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they that they made hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still make hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't smoke flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they never called it hash plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was it was just a term that got
put onto Afghans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people think it made it meant
meant something specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all Afghan and Pakistani stuff,
that's what they did with their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you make hash, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, and so there's an aspect
where we brought all these plants over to
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and started fucking with them,
whether they're Steve Murphy's Afghan that
[SPEAKER_00]: started the NFL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thing or the, you know, or the the Pacific
Northwest Hash Plan or the Big Bud story
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we weren't using them for hash plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't growing fields like they were
and doing anything that they were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did, we were looking for them
to blend well with our sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that means that right when they
got to America, a completely different set
[SPEAKER_00]: of selection pressures got put into play.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they were they were selecting for
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had been selected to work well in the
Afghanistan environment to make to make
[SPEAKER_00]: those people hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we brought it over here and tried to
blend it with our favorite weed to get
[SPEAKER_00]: good weed to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to and to finish early indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, all these different like they
weren't trying to they weren't there was
[SPEAKER_00]: no indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we used Afghans for indoor when
they came over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, they from Afghanistan or Pakistan
or that region, they were always growing
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't blowing up houses in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came from a cold, dry environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they weren't worried about the mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that like all of the
farmers looking for for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, genetics, you know, various
aspects that benefit an Afghanistan farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: was much different than a Washington,
Oregon, California, indoor or outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grower trying to fuck with some Mexicans
and some Colombians and some Panamanians
[SPEAKER_00]: and some Thai and blend this Afghan into
that and get what they.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a way different set of selection
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't really make hash for a long
time, except for for private.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, but we liked they were
short.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were squat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were they had a bunch of crystal,
you know, were visual creatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So frosty looking nugs work better for
Americans, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what were the what were the famous
one of the famous earliest hash plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the early ones, I mean, as far as the
earliest, we're going to go, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I mean, the PNW, there weren't a lot
of early, early hash plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of the ones early in the scene
would be like, you know, there was the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed bank cash plant, which would be their
hash plant pure, which would be different
[SPEAKER_02]: from, you know, the G 13 or the hash plant
and one which was using the G 13 hash
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and one we have the puck,
of course, a.k.a.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skelly, we have the cuttlefish hash plant,
B.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was also a champagne hash plant,
which I'm not sure is different from the B
[SPEAKER_02]: .C.
[SPEAKER_02]: hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe some of the Canadian folks will know
we have hash plant 13.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these some of these aren't
even necessarily from the hash plant
[SPEAKER_02]: family of strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: That came from Neville.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some of these were just called
hash plant because of whatever reason it
[SPEAKER_00]: became a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash plant is a bit like Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that it's a general term that applies
to a wide variety of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and why one thing was all
labeled Kush and another thing was labeled
[SPEAKER_00]: hash plant when the Kush was destined to
be made into hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one of those language things
that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's there is some confusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we can go into individual ones in
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to continue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to jump it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, so that's basically like and
then it became famous because in the 80s,
[SPEAKER_00]: as as he just showed, Neville started
calling things hash plant and there was
[SPEAKER_00]: famous hash plant hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, mostly Americans used it because
it was a short squat, decent yielding
[SPEAKER_00]: frosty plant inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't, you know, nobody was really
making hash in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked flour mostly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, champagne was different from the B.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you were going to jump around,
but I'm going to really jump around to
[SPEAKER_00]: like today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when when we first brought over all
these hash plants, they were brought over
[SPEAKER_00]: and they had been bred to be excellent
hash plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people like people in Europe and in
the know and Sammy and stuff have told me
[SPEAKER_00]: that they feel like a lot of modern
cultivars like a really shitty hash
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That a lot of the traditional ones that
were bred for that specifically and bred
[SPEAKER_00]: for resin are much better plants for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they were never bred for anything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now with the legalization and all that
and the hash revolution that's happened
[SPEAKER_00]: with all these various elements and dabs
and everything, we're actually like
[SPEAKER_00]: looking people talk about dumpers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talked about hash yield a lot in
various ways and methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so figuring out what plants are good
hash plants is like back in vogue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of for the first time ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like on on any kind of like commercial
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been making hash here
privately to share with their friends
[SPEAKER_00]: forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as like a like a major thing,
it's probably it's pretty recent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last 20 years, probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now with testing and people can be
like, oh, this thing washes six percent or
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing washes this.
[SPEAKER_00]: People start hunting for hash plant
yields.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is a good washer?
[SPEAKER_00]: What what keeps its flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we went 40 fucking years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without those pressures being applied.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is this is good input from archive,
he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dumpers are mainly just plants with higher
than average THC to turf ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, so there's an aspect where
it's like for a long time from what most
[SPEAKER_00]: people is hash plants came over here and
got mixed with other weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for breeding purposes,
you know, because like if you look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: puck or you look at that picture,
you know, some of those things were short,
[SPEAKER_00]: squat, ugly, you know, they weren't the
most attractive things always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even even Chem 91, you know, aside from
hash plants, Chem 91 is another Afghani
[SPEAKER_02]: not necessarily known for its beautiful
qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same kind of way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same kind of way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but they started becoming famous
because he put him in the first catalog.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was hash plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, like he was saying,
the Skelly, there's some that survived
[SPEAKER_00]: from back then that became got really well
known.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not related.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not not a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just someone's asking me to show the hash
plant here again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to show that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hash plant here, Neville took the
hash plant clone only he got from Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he crossed it to a male NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he took a male of that hybrid and
crossed it back to the to the hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was his hash plant pure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's honestly kind of like what he
did with a number of things, like when he
[SPEAKER_00]: offered his Hawaiian indica, there's a
number of things where he crossed it once
[SPEAKER_00]: to NL1 and then crossed a male of that
hybrid back to itself and just released
[SPEAKER_00]: that as a pure line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was actually a reasonably
common tactic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does appear that Neville got the hash
plant and the G13 on the same trip at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time from the same people even.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you have liked to have been able
to grab a pack of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghan mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville sold Neville sold seeds that Jim
Ortega had given him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got so many that he he offered up the
same seeds that he found all of the maple
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf stuff in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sold for a couple of years as just 50
pack 50 pack reader packs and 150 bucks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unreal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville was cool in that sense and that he
pretty much just told you what he was
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no real secrecy behind it,
you know, but he was also first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he didn't have to hide anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you know, the these hash plants,
some of these hash plants have gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very likely that the Puck is a direct
descendant of that picture, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the rumor at least that
it's seeds from then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our buddy Bodhi has a pretty
famous lot number of lines out that him
[SPEAKER_00]: and other people have used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt got some of those from NDN guy,
the G13 hash plant, which was 1988.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1988.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's that's kind of how they how
they type it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's basically supposed to be from the
first year that Neville released the G13
[SPEAKER_00]: hash plant hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I who knows what what they were
really from or what year or which seed
[SPEAKER_02]: bank or any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was the story given with them was
1988 since he seeds hash plant was where
[SPEAKER_02]: G13 hash plant, which was what they said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever it is, I mean, it's it that
exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people have that and
people have Puck hybrids and some people
[SPEAKER_00]: still have the Puck clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so there's some old hash
plants that exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can kind of like and then there
was kind of like another wave where people
[SPEAKER_00]: started kept using the nickname.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was all grown for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, nobody was really making
nobody was really using it the way they
[SPEAKER_00]: used it in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not not in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there was there was something
Puck is the hash plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like traditional hash plant and
hash plant strain like in that picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does have a lot of similar traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have a lot of similar traits,
you know, and it's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the community and stuff like that,
people breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, at the very least,
it ties back to something old.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's most basically what they were
doing is is in America, we were looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for like hash plants and Afghans that we
could cross to other things and would
[SPEAKER_00]: bring the flowering time and the height
and add some crystal and some density.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but keep but keep a lot of the other
qualities from the sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those were sort of the first blends
that people were after was structurally
[SPEAKER_00]: what the hash plant did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flavors of the sativa and the
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the flavor and the smoke and the
stretch, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's one of those it's one
of those aspects where we put a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: different selection pressures on it,
but kept the name.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, we got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the ones often mentioned is the
cuttlefish, you know, like not often
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned, I should say.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the in the like late 2000s,
it was used a lot by Subcoolscrew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And best I could tell, I remember talking
to Jill about about it came from Bad Boy,
[SPEAKER_02]: whoever that was, one of their buddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was actually a super skunk crossed
a skunk, skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like a fruity.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say skunky fruity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure on all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that was what the cuttlefish
hash plant was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't even a sensei hash planter seed
bank hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a super skunk, skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we we had a bunch of people that were
just asking about the G-13.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could focus on that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Fletch, you want to come in and talk
to you 13?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're from that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said before, one part of the
story is that Neville said on one of his
[SPEAKER_00]: American trips, he bought the G-13 and the
hash plant clone from somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Fletch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just hash planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old Northwest favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think something that people
forget is that the Northwest specifically,
[SPEAKER_01]: like Washington State, is where the HID
lighting company came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where some of the first hydroponics
companies came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the early 80s, this was the spot to
grow weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the climate is really good for
having heat inside your house,
[SPEAKER_01]: generally all year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's always like, oh, the humidity
is so high up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you know anything about,
you know, relative humidity, air that's 45
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees and 80 percent humidity,
and you bring that into like a 75 degree
[SPEAKER_01]: grow room and hit it with all that heat
from all your equipment, makes a perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you always hear people, oh,
there's mold or powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know tons of growers from up
here, and powdery mildew never existed in
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone's garden until clones started
coming up specifically from Ed Rosenthal's
[SPEAKER_01]: operation in the late 90s, early 2000s
with the other lady's name that was
[SPEAKER_01]: running it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they would like, I mean, they spread
that shit worldwide.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you want to be known for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, centralized clone selling is
really what has spread most problems
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dudding, the, you know, the viroids,
the powdery mildews, bugs, all these
[SPEAKER_00]: various different types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people were just getting clones from
their buddy or a small group of friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: it kept most problems localized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's when people start stop
maintaining their own mothers and will
[SPEAKER_00]: just like, oh, I'll fucking buy 200 cuts
for my next run and started getting them
[SPEAKER_00]: from dispensaries and getting them from
these centralized places.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of when all these issues
started spreading like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was because they'd get into a poorly
run Ed Rosenthal situation, or they'd get
[SPEAKER_00]: into a dark heart or whatever,
and then they would just sell to thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's talk some G13.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you know, what you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he probably knows, but I will say one
more thing and then I'll shut up,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that you know, Neville says that he got
it on this trip and Jorge confirmed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we interviewed Bjornsson,
right, that was like the one tidbit that
[SPEAKER_00]: we got was he, remember he said that the
G13 was actually called the UW.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The UW.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what his statement was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like literally in an hour and a
half of talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the one piece of weed history
that he casually mentioned that like was
[SPEAKER_00]: any, but you know, it seems like it was
one of those, like Fletch was saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was one of those things where they were
collecting different clones that worked
[SPEAKER_00]: good indoors and trading them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even up here, people were really reserved
about sharing any kind of clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was true, you know, probably up until
medical changed in like 2008 with Obama's
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever that announcement was where
everybody basically started growing weed
[SPEAKER_01]: because it said the feds weren't going to
fuck with you anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were going to pause.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before that, getting clones was hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people, you know, everybody just,
if you had weed, you never told anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if it was from your garden,
I mean, there's plenty of people you buy
[SPEAKER_01]: weed from, you never knew they grew weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just said their uncle got it or
whoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, but the G, so what were we talking
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: G-13 or which one?
[SPEAKER_02]: G-13, let's do G-13, U-dub, stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So U-dub and well G-13, as far as I know,
there's two, there's historically only two
[SPEAKER_01]: clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Airborne, which is from Ohio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's Pacific, which is from
out here, like West Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Pacific was named Pacific because of
the user Pacific on Cannabis World.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She, he, I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was like in some band or, and I can't,
she was some kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: modern shit of some sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she had two different clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's how she liked to be
referred to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the U-dub purple or I think,
didn't she call it U-dub purple,
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: U-dub black or purple?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: People call it U-dub black now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said shit that people made up out of
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the U-dub purple, I think was,
and I think she would sometimes call it
[SPEAKER_01]: purple G-13 up here, but having been
around here for a long time, I never saw
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the U-dub purple or purple that she
had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the same as the purple indica Tacoma
perp family of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's well known up here in Washington,
which is like how me and Caleb ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming friends 20 years ago is cause he
had the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the PI from up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew those were families of plants that
were localized to our areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were trying to figure out,
Hey, are these things related?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they similar?
[SPEAKER_01]: And me personally, having now worked with
the purple indica a lot and knowing its
[SPEAKER_01]: history up here, I mean, it wasn't called
purple indica when I got it up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just an unknown clone that I
received.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just able to identify it as a
plant from that family of purples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb and I, we got this other clone that
we call the Tacoma perp that came from a
[SPEAKER_01]: user Stony Puff and stuff on this world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a different clone,
but the same family of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also had pop bag seeds in like 2002 of
that from those bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that same weed plants, they were all
almost identical to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could have passed any of them off as
any of the purple weed that comes around
[SPEAKER_01]: up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was kind of, that's kind of the
same with Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, you've got Urkel for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: 71 whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 different versions of the same
essentially genotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Expression.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of type phenotype within a population or
whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and it's hard to say whether the
chicken or the egg came first,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did the Urkel come first or did a GDP?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one came from which one?
[SPEAKER_01]: And unless you have, let's get the history
of it, it's pretty hard to figure out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the G13s, the airborne G13 that I've
seen is probably most definitely related
[SPEAKER_01]: to the lemon G, AKA lemon G13.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was all, as it was also called.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both carry this trait and it's also a,
I think it's a virus that transfers from
[SPEAKER_01]: it through seed from parents, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the actual data to support
exactly that, but for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: the lemon peel that I have is the lemon
cross with I9.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has a, wrap or virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have tested for that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like after the second run from
clone, it had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've never, it doesn't transfer to any
other strains at all except for lemon G
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrids.
Weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is really weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so does the lemon G itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of virus is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wrap or virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raspberry dwarf virus.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never even heard of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, my point is simply that there
can even be, you know, stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that can show you potentially a genetic
relation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we've never sold pure lemon peel
hybrids, you know, for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the airborne is the one that Pip
showed us, not so the one that he was
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping his G13 that he called Ohio G13.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think he had a similar theory that
it was related to the lemon G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he had the lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he rocked the lemon G like he
monocropped it in that region for years
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was really familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say that, you know,
one thing about the Pacific that makes me
[SPEAKER_00]: think that it's probably old is that it is
really ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not a pretty plant,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pacific, you know, like, you know,
like, or Pipsburg, like the G,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I mean, that's kind of like one of
its things, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas like the G13 was like when,
when Neville would chat about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, he said it was,
it was kind of ugly, but it had crazy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it added, it added a bunch of
potency and a bunch of crystal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by itself, it wasn't all that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I did all those high times events
and everything, you know, every once in a
[SPEAKER_01]: while you'd have someone come through that
you, and they were always old timers,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like these are more,
and they would just come through and just
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you some information about a strain
that you potentially have on your menu or
[SPEAKER_01]: have hybrids of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this older lady Kate had come to my
booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was either at Emerald Cup or
one of the other high times events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she told me, do you know what the
Lemon G13 is?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, I first had gotten it
from Shroomy back in like 2005 or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew it was old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew it was from Ohio, cause he was in
Pittsburgh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was from right across the border
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Lemon G was like, you know,
it, it's a very distinct plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't miss it for anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's smell, how it grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like just a really big plant
with big buds, but kind of not the most
[SPEAKER_01]: resonance thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, she said that it was the G13,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from out there with a skunk misty
from Sensi seeds that hermied onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what that story.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes perfect sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the plants, if you've ever
grown, it does have skunk number one type
[SPEAKER_01]: growth characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where those long running colas came
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's number one from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if you've grown the airborne G13,
that weird and sour, bitter smell,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's from the airborne G.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like, you can smell it between
the airborne and it's, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so like I was saying,
between all those factors plus the dwarf
[SPEAKER_01]: virus that's, that's self contained to
that specific family of plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's pretty identifiable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say for certain whether or not
it's all a hundred percent the same
[SPEAKER_01]: family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of covers the, the airborne
G13, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most likely a clone from Ohio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know any other history other than
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most likely the parent to Lemon G as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I know as well about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to ask you, this is a little off
topic, but since we touched a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: what do you think on the purple indica
versus urkel?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's what I was going to say
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown enough PI hybrids that I've
gotten urkel phenotypes from purple indica
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wouldn't surprise me in the least,
especially considering how widespread that
[SPEAKER_01]: purple indica clone or that family of
clones was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would bet money if you, if you showed
that purple indica to Greg, that he would
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately be able to identify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like every other guy I know that's
been up in Seattle and Northern Oregon for
[SPEAKER_01]: the last 30 years growing weed,
almost every single one of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can pull it out immediately
identifiable by them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see what he says.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'd like to do is go out there and
bring him a bunch of samples and see if he
[SPEAKER_01]: can identify anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys close?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you guys are kind of close out
there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, relative.
No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but you know what I'm saying though,
is that like, who knows what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: smells he could potentially identify as
just being related to something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like I was talking about the lemon G
and the G13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Pacific G13, I never saw
anything but a couple of samples of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it never was very impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The UW purple, that purple family that we
were just talking about, purple indica,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are definitely not related to the
Pacific G13.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then UW was just a name for any weed
that came out of the University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington area of Seattle, which was like
kind of where you would go buy weed off
[SPEAKER_01]: the streets, you know, kind of like in
park in New York kind of deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like go down to the U district and
you could buy weed off the streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you had, you know, between that,
the glass blowers, which was a giant part
[SPEAKER_01]: that is often overlooked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost over as if it wasn't an important
part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the glass blowing scene was a large
part of the distribution network of clones
[SPEAKER_01]: around the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I first got the Trinity and
the snow and, you know, a bunch of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things, that was all out of Eugene glass
blowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were blowing circles.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was all, that was one of the
ways that hippies spread and communicated
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were blowing pipes and they had
ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dog shit, same channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to think of other strains that were
glass scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: The super bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a handful of strains up
here that maybe haven't gotten any air
[SPEAKER_01]: time, but the cough was super.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the, through the glass blowing
scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the cough was like a, Oh,
somebody just said the Quimby.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another Quimby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Quimby is just another is from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just another like old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of those strains passed around
those same circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green sucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they, they even had their own
four way, which wasn't like a four way
[SPEAKER_00]: from, uh, was like a four way from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they just called it the same thing,
but it wasn't anything related to
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's or anything from Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like Trinity by something,
by something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember, but that was,
that's my knowledge of G 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, it's somewhat anecdotal,
but I've seen a lot of samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hold on a sec.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are saying, we're not just hearing
facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hearing conjecture about G 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for that is because the G 13 is
from the eighties, which is a long fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the memories are old and some of them
are legends.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we, what we think we know for sure is
that it came out of the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when it first popped up and
friends of Jorge Cervantes gave it to
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville who took it to Europe and bred
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can add to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the name supposedly came from the
license plate as best as I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a license plates license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and so it became, and it became
traded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it was bred in the Europe and then
it was traded in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it kind of became this legendary
thing for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of it is conjecture because
you have all these things called G 13,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what's their origin?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one thing I'd like to mention is
that when I first started growing G 13 was
[SPEAKER_01]: not a really well known subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing was some internet folklore
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that it was in the catalog
back in the day, that was the only
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no one really gave a shit at all about
it until that movie, American,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: American beauty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A thousand dollar ounce of G 13 on the
fucking American beauty movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everybody's like, what's that G
13 shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that some shit came from the
government?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing that happened with UW
is like, when I was buying weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: UW was just a, came from an area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be multiple different strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like Crippy or any of those other
names.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was never the single variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you had like the medical
scene around here pop up and you had
[SPEAKER_01]: people trying to like kind of stake their
claim in the ground, but didn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't really in the scene prior to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, I have the original UW like,
dude, there never even was like the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're even trying to say you have
the only UW is how I know you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: it because, because it doesn't this you're
trying to stake a claim about something
[SPEAKER_01]: that was, that was just a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't, it's specified to a variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much like Thunderfuck, you know,
all those other or even, or even diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my, my buddies who lived in New
York in that era, that was, that was slang
[SPEAKER_00]: for, for dank weed right then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it that diesel?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got that diesel?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, now it like means something much
more specific, but it started off as just
[SPEAKER_00]: slang for good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no Indian guy did not have anything to
do with G13 people making up stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while we have you here, let's touch on
another hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we've done this before,
but I don't think we've done it on the
[SPEAKER_02]: syndicate show HP 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my only experience with it is that
I went to those parties in Hawaii back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, and that's the same,
the Jason King, Canna Bible group of
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the only place I ever saw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was well known amongst their circle
that it had come from New York city or
[SPEAKER_01]: from New York somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not from Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was brought there by from my
understanding, a bunch of hippies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's basically, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what'd you think about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I always deserve the hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when I first saw it and it was like
jungle grown, I was like, Oh hell no.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I got the clone later from,
from Caleb.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked the turps on it a lot,
but doesn't transfer to flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it itself it's more one of those
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can taste it because it smells so
strong, not because it converts to a
[SPEAKER_01]: really tasty flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hermy prone, the lower bottoms on
it, always through sacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would have light leaks or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty hard to breed with in my
experience, but it, it has one of the more
[SPEAKER_01]: unique terpene profiles out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one thing Jason King was correct
about is that the terp profile is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always, it's always a bummer to me
when the terp profile is so strong and
[SPEAKER_00]: direct, and then it doesn't translate into
the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like that, like, like the,
yeah, like the version of bubble gum,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it smells sometimes the smell
and the, you know, I mean, that's the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing true with hash too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes flavors on flour don't translate
into any of the hash you make with it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that HP 13 doesn't have a good
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, it's so strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You expect it, it promises to deliver more
than it actually does because the smell is
[SPEAKER_01]: so potent on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's what it, what, one thing I've
found with having run through so many seed
[SPEAKER_01]: plants over so many years is that there's
this fine line between there's like three
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of textures of wheat in my
main textures.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really terpy stuff that's low in
THC and it kind of has that soft silky
[SPEAKER_01]: feel to the resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not tacky and you can't wash with it
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have like the other end of the
spectrum, which is like really high in
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, but whatever terpenes are in it,
don't make it slick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like alcohol and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You add enough alcohol to water and it
won't freeze.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you most terpenes and, and styles
and everything else in it are like
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol, like compounds, they have low
free.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you mix that with THC,
you need enough THC to stabilize the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have really terpy low THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of has that soft feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sometimes the shit just doesn't
translate to flavor no matter how terpy it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have this stuff that's like all THC,
but no terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that shit washes like crazy,
but it always lacks in flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have stuff where it's really
fucking terpy and it's really high in THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's that stick to the wall type shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's almost always the best to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like all of the old elites that
ended up testing between 18 and 24% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just had that blend of terps and
flavor and enough potency to get you
[SPEAKER_00]: there, entourage effect, whatever you want
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was interesting for me seeing a bunch
of holding a big library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when testing first started
happening and you started getting to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what your weed was like me realizing that
like, I mean, I don't, I don't know about,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about you Fletch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really like most 30% plus
strengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of find them bland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the ones that work best for me,
like are somewhere in the, in the low to
[SPEAKER_00]: mid twenties most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't just taste really strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even care about the potency of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, I mean,
you know, I used to have Joe, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: still have hundreds of jars available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone comes over and they can smoke
through whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that purple Indica only tests like 15
to 18% on a good day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for 20 years, no matter what everybody
picked out of my pile of jars to smoke,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd always say that was the most potent
strain to them, had the most narcotic
[SPEAKER_01]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously THC isn't the only thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is there's hundreds of
known cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only test for like 10 of them,
maybe in biosays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, and we've just found like,
did you guys see that Italian research
[SPEAKER_01]: paper where they found that THC that's 30
times more potent than THC and they found
[SPEAKER_01]: it in flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have 1% of that, that's the
equivalent of 30% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have flour that's 20% THC and
then have 100% of this secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid that we currently don't test
for THCP if that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit might feel like it's 50%,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you've got 30% with that extra
potent stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, it's like heroin and
fentanyl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for people asking, this will be up on
YouTube after we're going to try to have
[SPEAKER_02]: it up in audio as well later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, that's kind of a tangent,
but it's basically, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's absolutely no way, you know,
to, to tell like how well weed is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: work on someone by the available testing
that we commonly do today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a general sense of low or high
THC and you can get some terpenes and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can learn some things from it,
but it's not comprehensive enough by any
[SPEAKER_00]: means to, to tell you why, why it works
the way that it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're, you're talking about,
we're only testing for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: five or 10% of the potential cannabinoids,
most of which the other cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't even know what they do still.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, then you're talking about we
test for a small portion of the terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: and thials and everything else that
produces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, we're going to start making
assumptions with 10% of the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to start making assumptions
about the plants with 10% of the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty useless science right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like phylose creating a whole
system on it, telling you you could have
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic relation with about the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also quite possible that we put
the most importance on THC simply because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the oldest compound we know of that
relates to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've just, we've just all been
preconditioned to accept that that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: big macro.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you know why we're preconditioned is
because that's the compound they made
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's the one that the
government said was the most important
[SPEAKER_01]: compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's at the end of the day,
it's probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what my, my whole point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could, we could know 15 or 20 years
from now that this combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids or whatever is actually way
more important to like this specific
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling than any number on that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all these people breeding for 32% THC
with no turps and still smokes like
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking smoking gravel.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all because we're using a testing
system to sell stuff to consumers that
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't even in their best interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you said something the other
day, and I know it, it, it didn't like a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people found it controversial,
but I thought I could relate to it very
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you made a comment that you are done
with regular seeds and it's on defense
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you, can you like extrapolate on that
a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: So people understand what you were
actually saying, saying, Oh, I'm just
[SPEAKER_02]: making jokes most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, but I mean, but it's relevant,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: People take this shit way too seriously,
but I mean, you know, the, the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: always have the most to say are typically
the people that are offended by it the
[SPEAKER_01]: most.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why are they offended?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe they're not so proud of what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I just related to it so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to sell regular seeds in this
market right now is, is very, very
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not as much of a, I don't even
know if there is a big market left for
[SPEAKER_02]: regular seeds at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, most people aren't,
particularly, you know, especially with
[SPEAKER_01]: the compression and pricing people are not
concerned with doing things the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're concerned with how they're going
to pay their bills and make it to the next
[SPEAKER_01]: crop or keep the lights on at their
facility or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, that's why you got people that
are like, you know, they got a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: lights up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know what to do with any of the
product and their choices at that point
[SPEAKER_01]: are I'm going to partner with someone
that's going to run the thing and sell it
[SPEAKER_01]: all for me, or I'm going to start hitting
up people that work at nurseries,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of other businesses tell their
nursery employee, Hey, I'll give you 50
[SPEAKER_01]: grand to buy a clone from whoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then trying to undercut their market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, look, you're, you're never
going to create a market for yourself by
[SPEAKER_01]: always just picking up the scraps of
somebody else's.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fact, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, what's the point of picking
up someone else's scraps?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you should be working on your
own stuff because then you can,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can, then you can have enough
burn rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: On whatever that product is for yourself
that you can take advantage of that and be
[SPEAKER_01]: proud of what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that shit won't offend you
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fact, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I've learned too, is that all
these dudes that like to knock stuff off,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what they do for a living.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all going to come to a screeching
halt when a lot of the people that are
[SPEAKER_02]: producing unique shit are no longer doing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, once those people are removed
from the equation, then who's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: make the unique shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: No one.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're cut off.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, what's the point in all just
chopping each other's legs off when we
[SPEAKER_01]: could all just be producing something only
a generation or two removed, but is now
[SPEAKER_01]: because you did your work and found
something cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the market's bigger instead of
smaller, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, if you guys want to
survive, you better work on making the
[SPEAKER_01]: market bigger for everybody that's in it,
not smaller.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of reminds me of like the,
just like the, the human nature aspects of
[SPEAKER_00]: all this shit, you know, because there's a
part of it too, where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you think about it like in music or
something like that, when there's like
[SPEAKER_00]: something, you know, people come out and
they just create something and then that
[SPEAKER_00]: creates a demand for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a whole bunch of other
musicians who follow in their footsteps
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's easier than creating their
own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's like a, now there's like a
heavy metal genre.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a gangster rap genre.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a, there's an era where,
like it's not named, people are just doing
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's happened with the,
with the named, with the named,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, strain game, basically is that
rather than people breeding a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: weed that they like and trying to get more
weed that they like, they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, fuck this thing from archive or
matter, whoever is blowing up right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to cross everything to Dusty
doe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to cross everything to Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to cross everything to
Cushman's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to cross everything to,
because it's popular and they're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: put their own, their own flavor on it,
but it's not like it just happens in weed
[SPEAKER_00]: that happens anywhere where there's
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the other thing I was
thinking of when you guys were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the breeding aspect was that even
talking about seeds today, when,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when Neville was on Mr. Nice or
whatever, he used to talk about people
[SPEAKER_00]: would all the time bitch that they wanted
all these pure Indica hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they didn't yield through the roof
and they weren't amazing in every way,
[SPEAKER_00]: they bitch up a storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was constantly thinking about
like what he could release and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: public would accept.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it made me think that even today,
right now we got, there's a difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between what the public says it wants and
then where it's money talks in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: buying seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it says it wants a lot of stuff that
it doesn't really support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the price compression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everybody's looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone wants something different,
but they all want to sell, have the same
[SPEAKER_01]: sales strategy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple frosty and want to sell a hundred
pack, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're not everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are companies that are
phenom hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're working on providing unique
varieties to their business, regardless of
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not it's a hype strain or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're in all markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's, you know, there's a good
amount of those companies that are working
[SPEAKER_01]: on it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem becomes, depending on how
big their business is, is the most
[SPEAKER_01]: productive varieties typically aren't the
dankest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're selling to a wholesale only
market and aren't vertically integrated,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really hard to grow a two pound
variety instead of a three pound variety
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever the difference is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like fruits and vegetables,
the big old monster tomatoes typically are
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones that taste like water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, that's like one of Caleb
and I's running jokes, dude, is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty little thing in the corner that you
thought about killing ends up being the
[SPEAKER_00]: clear winner in the smoke test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, why is that retarded runt
over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, why is that one head and shoulders
above all these beautiful producing
[SPEAKER_00]: structure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing dense buds all over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this stressed out little thing here
that almost died.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that everybody wants the
smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a, I think the, the smoke
ability of a strain is a combination of
[SPEAKER_01]: two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, it's the type of,
and how much resin there is on the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there is how the plant material
smokes itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are two completely different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why people like hash is cause you
get rid of all the plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the shit that like has good turps
or good trichomes on it, but shitty plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material, you can smoke it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, man, the flower is completely
nothing to write home about, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: make some fresh frozen hash with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Banana smoothie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there, you know, there's a purpose for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you start talking about like mass
versus trichomes, if you increase the
[SPEAKER_01]: mass, but there's only the same amount of
trichomes, it's inevitably probably going
[SPEAKER_01]: to continue to taste worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever has the least amount of mass,
that smokes poorly of flower material with
[SPEAKER_01]: the highest concentration of resin,
good tasty resin is probably going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: your best week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, it's just a trichome
concentration versus plant mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at it a little differently because
I talk about burn ability all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's really important to me,
but I think that there's like a,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's like an air to bud ratio,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, obviously some things you
put them on this, you know, you put them
[SPEAKER_00]: on and, and the thing is huge,
but it weighs three grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other thing you put it on and it's the
same, it's the same size and it weighs
[SPEAKER_00]: eight, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think like how dense things are,
like one of the things I like about
[SPEAKER_00]: diesels is it kind of has all those like
nooks and crannies and hills and crevices
[SPEAKER_00]: and different things, the way the bud
forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, it's not that dense,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think that makes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the amount of trichomes versus the mass
of the plant material, the plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like that stuff washes better
because there's more surface area where
[SPEAKER_00]: like the super thick stuff, you almost
have to chop it up into little bits to get
[SPEAKER_00]: it to wash well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's only so much exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much you get on X amount of mass of
flour and it's things like Bubba,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, you could,
Bubba doesn't have a lot of surface area
[SPEAKER_01]: to put trichomes because it's so dense
with plant material.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why does it test low?
[SPEAKER_01]: And why does one little nudge like this
turn into like a joint that's fucking that
[SPEAKER_01]: fat?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why, because it has a lot of plant
material mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was, there was an aspect
too, where I used to have this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to have this judge of whether I
thought things were like perfect density
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I was breeding stuff a bunch
was, could I break it off in the dark and
[SPEAKER_00]: put it into a pipe and smoke it
effectively?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, and if you can't do that without
like the snow used to be like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you almost needed scissors or a
grinder, you know, if you just broke off a
[SPEAKER_00]: big chunk and shoved it into a bowl or a
bong or something like that, it would
[SPEAKER_00]: barely burn.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition selection standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you know, cookies,
cookies can be like that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be too dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it breeds a certain density.
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you been focusing on and on your
projects lately?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like is there anything you're stoked
about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything you're working with lately that
you're like, fuck, this is so unique and
[SPEAKER_02]: so different that I, you know,
I'm going to work on this for a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything like that currently going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, man, I'm just always just
selecting through plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I just popped like another 500
seeds the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's, I just want to find new shit
all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, shit half the time all,
like I just went to California and went to
[SPEAKER_01]: all these big grows and everything and met
up with everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, everybody was on schedule,
but the like, the one that I wasn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly impressed with was the one
that all the biggest growers all said,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, can I get a clone?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up with that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to, I need to, I need to make this
one a strain or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, I didn't even think
that was that out of all the stuff I
[SPEAKER_01]: brought, that's not my personal favorite,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, it's like, I never really know
what's fucking, I just try to grow really
[SPEAKER_01]: good weeds and shit that I think is unique
and tastes really good and has that the
[SPEAKER_01]: right ratios, everything we were just
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, everybody, I let everybody else
decide what, what's really unique to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you told me, you know,
10 years that papaya would be unique to
[SPEAKER_01]: people, I'd tell you you're fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most run of the mill shit on
the fucking planet at that time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so only 10 years later, you know,
Dutch skunk number one fruit turps is
[SPEAKER_01]: unique because everyone grows only gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had told me skunk one would have
had a comeback.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would never in a million years have
believed that.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was, there, there was a
time, you know, in Mendo where you
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't give a Cali O pound away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, and then the,
the nails got invented and people started
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing and Angie became popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I couldn't believe Angie when it,
when it hit, I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we redoing Cali O again?
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck's going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but we forget that, you know,
the majority of the smoking population is
[SPEAKER_01]: 18 to 28 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after most people turn 28, they get
kids, family, they smoke less,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that shit, whatever was old to the
people that just quit smoking is brand new
[SPEAKER_01]: to the next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we, we, we had a, we had a,
like a 15 year downturn.
[SPEAKER_00]: For perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it came back with a vengeance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a vengeance, you know, there,
there was an era long time ago when,
[SPEAKER_00]: when everything purple went like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that wasn't the case for decade
and a half or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it came back and all of a sudden,
you know, I, you hear that like very 2005
[SPEAKER_00]: statement, you know, like, I don't know if
this is purple enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could this be darker?
[SPEAKER_01]: You see people extending the periods for
these strains now.
[SPEAKER_01]: By like adding two novel things together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got like Tropicana cookies and it's
like just tangy, but it's purple,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the blackberry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people are like excited about it
again, you know, Mendo perp, same thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's like, people get tired of
it when it's just the Mendo perp,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, call it forbidden fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's the hot shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, yeah, I mean, I, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's crazy about the forbidden fruit is
that when citrus is strong, it's like one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most dominant, it can be,
it can breed one of the most dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: turps at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then, and then it's,
and it's often a one or two note turk
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's like, you don't get other
scents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when it's citrus, it's just like
pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that forbidden fruit is really weird
because it smells just like, it's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: one note purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty plant, you know,
pretty super pretty, super pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, but yeah, it's,
it just, it smells like if you like orange
[SPEAKER_00]: citrus and that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think here's an important thing
to, I think what we're talking about is
[SPEAKER_01]: really a product of the, how easily
information is spread nowadays,
[SPEAKER_01]: because like you were talking about
before, how plant diseases were isolated
[SPEAKER_01]: to small groups of people, if,
if at all, because people didn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: share plants, the same thing was true with
the selling part of weed 20 years ago as
[SPEAKER_01]: well is I don't know what the fuck people
were smoking in Georgia or Tennessee,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know what I can buy around me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I didn't have this, this
preconception that I can get some purple
[SPEAKER_01]: weed that smells like orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was not choices like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody just basically created their
own standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of quality and preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were localized to even just
small groups of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's why we had so many
unique strains that, that were able to
[SPEAKER_01]: survive prohibition is because the whole
market wasn't gelato or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: because no one had a big enough row to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one knew about a strain enough to do
all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, every, so like strains like
HP 13 survived because that was the best
[SPEAKER_01]: weed that a whole group of people in the
country could get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they demanded that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that clone survived.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, you know, that was one of the
benefits of prohibition is that it
[SPEAKER_01]: actually did help keep some of the
diversity alive because you had these
[SPEAKER_01]: independent markets that weren't affected
from external sort of external input.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we have the opposite where
everyone is so influenced by external
[SPEAKER_01]: input that almost no one keeps anything
unique around anymore at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the customer doesn't even know that
they want it because it's not even
[SPEAKER_01]: available in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I mean, that's something I trip on all
the time is because like California,
[SPEAKER_00]: like in, in some degree, like,
or where I live might be considered kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like a, you know, the forefront of
certain things, good and bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the bad things, was like the,
the whole like named clone craze that took
[SPEAKER_00]: off where, you know, first it was purples
and it was cushions and sours and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, it just, but what that meant is that
people kept dropping stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked earlier in the show about
how that G 13 cut probably survived in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ohio because like you, you, you grow weed
in these areas where it's good enough weed
[SPEAKER_00]: that it always sells and there's not
pressure to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they keep these favorites wherever in
Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they even legal yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or no, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just meant like anywhere,
anywhere that doesn't fate, like
[SPEAKER_00]: California pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, the first real praise was the
purple craze in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that people just grew good weed and
it all sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the purple craze hit and it
became about the Mendo P or the Urkel or
[SPEAKER_00]: the GDP, or, you know, this half a dozen
different purple strains, there would be
[SPEAKER_00]: people that would come up from the bank
today and they will like, I will buy every
[SPEAKER_00]: gram of this weed that I can find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that created this pressure where
all these different growers were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, why do I want to grow this other
shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to turn this 40 lights or
whatever into Urkel and boom it out
[SPEAKER_00]: because these people are going to cash me
out even for my odd pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with every time that happens,
diversity gets fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you fast forward, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fast forward 15 years from then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the purple craze hit,
everybody starts hitting up like the six
[SPEAKER_00]: people that kept purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like everyone I knew had an
Urkel or grape ape or a, or a,
[SPEAKER_00]: or GDP or a Mendo P cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was an era after that
where like every single farmer I knew
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor and outdoor ran some sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's not, if it's not what the
easiest thing to sell, then they drop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys feel like we're in that stage
right now, currently with anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where a bunch of shit's getting dropped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'll tell you something crazy,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a buddy from, from so hum hit me up
and say that a bunch of brokers were
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to talk about wanting sour diesel
this year and they couldn't, they couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: find clones of sour diesel and so weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is weird because it'd been three,
four years and everybody's been growing
[SPEAKER_00]: gelatos and weird hybrids of gelato and
these weird purple crosses and jealousy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, and that was the only thing
that people wanted to pay for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't think sour would get pushed
out, but it doesn't take that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: All it takes is a few seasons or one
season of your broker telling you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to find something though.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they do want, you know, or they tell
you, Oh, I'll buy that, but it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you had this, I'd pay you this much
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go that route.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely doesn't have the cookies
appeal at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't, you know, but it's like,
but everyone had sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's a global of the
marketplace, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it really, it's a
nationalization, but California supplying
[SPEAKER_01]: is globally at this point now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just like, you know,
kind of when you travel the world
[SPEAKER_01]: nowadays, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's a lot, it's not nearly as,
as culturally diverse, especially in the
[SPEAKER_01]: touristy areas than 20 years ago or in
particularly 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I ever experienced that,
but it's just where we have this
[SPEAKER_01]: information is disseminated so quickly
nowadays that it's that we're losing a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of diversity on the planet for a lot of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with cannabis particularly,
because it was prohibited by the
[SPEAKER_01]: governments, we have probably the very
last agricultural crop that had its own
[SPEAKER_01]: free independent economy and distribution
system for a multi-billion dollar planet
[SPEAKER_01]: plant per year in value with absolutely
zero government intervention and policies
[SPEAKER_01]: that would dictate how and why people
would operate their business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we move to the whole opposite with
that with globalization and
[SPEAKER_01]: nationalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: With one exception to that, they didn't
have any control over how we set it up
[SPEAKER_00]: except for things they did would make us
adapt to not encounter them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the shipping methods, all the very,
all the various aspects of the business
[SPEAKER_00]: was to work around government intervention
of any kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't really, they didn't,
they didn't really dictate to us,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they did influence how we responded in
a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of that, we had a much more
diverse scene because everybody figured
[SPEAKER_01]: out a different way to manipulate the
system to their advantage, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really was Adam Smith and the invisible
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys familiar with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Adam Smith, when he wrote about
capitalism and all that, it's like a super
[SPEAKER_00]: famous thing that he did, but he wrote
about basically like real capitalism is
[SPEAKER_00]: like there's an invisible hand that takes
the goods from where they are and pulls
[SPEAKER_00]: them to where they're wanted to be bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a system that will get set
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a demand in some place and
there's margin and profit to be made,
[SPEAKER_00]: a system will be set up by people to get
that profit and to bring the goods to
[SPEAKER_00]: where the people want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's essentially what happened with
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how weed got spread all over
America when it was totally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the invisible hand divvied it up.
Exactly.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then the invisible hand is
just, it's just no government,
[SPEAKER_00]: no government making any rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's interesting that like in
California, especially they made a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of rules and they crashed the very
successful system within five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what we were getting at is
that like, if you let the government get
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in anything, they will ruin it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the general rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Name one war that we've waged in the last
50 years in this country where we won it,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it was a foreign war or a domestic
war, the war on drugs, shit, drugs are
[SPEAKER_01]: more available and more plentiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't win any wars, war on
homelessness.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't win anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if they're meant to be won.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no profit in solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucked up, but there's no profit in
collapsing an agricultural commodity that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're the one taxing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the funny part is the government is
so bad at their job that they're the only
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that make money without having to
spend any in this real business,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, other than, other than just
enforcing the rules that they,
[SPEAKER_01]: that get written, but they're taking in
what a third of the income and the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: state or more in most of these cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and the, the biggest loser is them by
collapsing the system around themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if the, if the price of weed goes
to basically non-profitable and I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, I've talked about this for a long
ass time without subsidies and or farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: unions farming in America doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been doom and gloom forever about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he hasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been talking about subsidies and
collapsing markets and, and, and what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens with industrial utilization and
all that for quite some time, but here the
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest benefit right is because there's
no union and no subsidies to get this to
[SPEAKER_01]: survive that the consumption of weed is
going to continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people are just, there's
nothing to save these big corporations and
[SPEAKER_01]: these big investment firms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They in business, there's nothing to save
them.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a, in the right scenario,
depending on how much it ends up costing a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of these big businesses to operate and
how the consumers perception and demands
[SPEAKER_01]: may change small farms might be the ones
that come out winning because there isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: the, as we're seeing now in California and
as the, as every state gets its own supply
[SPEAKER_01]: set up and there's not this distribution
network, this demand from all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: world for export product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're growing way more weed than people
need to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all it takes is the consumer demanding
a little bit higher quality product and
[SPEAKER_01]: the consumption amount or the amount of
players being too many for the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only things that may be profitable
is small businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you guys, did you guys not to
interrupt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you guys see that thing in Canada
where they destroyed like hundreds of tons
[SPEAKER_00]: of unused weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: They burned it because of overproduction
and they couldn't pump it through the
[SPEAKER_00]: system and it aged out and turned brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, they had all these huge
greenhouses and they did this big power
[SPEAKER_00]: play.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting that you say that dude,
because there is definitely a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are trying to get into the
industry by just having a better burn rate
[SPEAKER_00]: than small farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're hoping to do is bleed
everybody out, be able to survive longer
[SPEAKER_00]: because they have more capital and then
take over the bones and they end up with a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of market share.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what Homi is saying is that they could
actually bleed out beyond where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to bleed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the price spike doesn't happen
after that to like be able to recover
[SPEAKER_00]: their lost, because what they're trying to
do is they're willing to lose money now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're planning on making more money
later and they just, the plan is not to
[SPEAKER_00]: just light a huge pile of money on fire
and watch it burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they actually, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But their problem is that now that people
are growing weed more easily everywhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more quantity of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, Oklahoma has intercepted
pick six, the whole game from California
[SPEAKER_01]: in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to continue to happen
with every new state that comes online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it becomes easy to grow more herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, you know, companies like Trulieve
in Florida, well, you've got companies
[SPEAKER_01]: like Jungle Boys and everybody else that
can come in and take their lunch from them
[SPEAKER_01]: from a business operations standpoint and
quality perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got the little small
grower chipping away at you too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, like the market may not
sustain their billion dollar aspirations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may not be able to be that big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing that in Washington
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest growers in Washington are
shutting down 2,000 light operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're selling $200 packaged pounds,
rec, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A thousand light grows that bring in
buyers from out of state, buy it from the
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed place.
[SPEAKER_01]: They deposit cash and the state knows
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like the supply, there's so many
operations to supply the demand now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there is like a rosy outcome
for them down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they might just be lighting,
lighting tens of millions of dollars on
[SPEAKER_01]: fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if they can't find more money to
keep sustaining their money losing
[SPEAKER_01]: operations, it's, they're done for
anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, canopy growth shut down
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did they spend?
[SPEAKER_01]: $230 million on a greenhouse in medicine
hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sold it for $30 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: $35 million recently just to keep the
lights on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, you know, you can't run a
business like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flo Khanna up by me, they raised 175
million bucks and they, they pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: blew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so where's the ground going to come
from when the economics looks the way it
[SPEAKER_01]: does now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and there's another aspect
of it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you, you know, we were chatting
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember it was last week or the
week before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like it is this weird thing because
since cannabis is legal in some spots and
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal in others, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, and the, and the line between the
two is super murky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's all this, there's all this
stuff happening, you know, where most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the companies in California surviving by
back door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's how they're surviving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then on top of that,
like up in, you know, when the hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: when the hemp implosion happened in 2000,
2018, uh, up in his neck of the woods and
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern Oregon and all those areas,
those places started growing at a level
[SPEAKER_00]: never before seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all these, there's all these
criminal groups and cartels that started
[SPEAKER_00]: doing things on a scale that had never
been seen before and daring the
[SPEAKER_00]: authorities to come catch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's massive amounts of weed
that are being grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read in places that, that,
uh, you know, uh, Mexican, Mexican
[SPEAKER_00]: imports, export is down 75% from,
from the good days for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and they are going into all kinds of
different businesses to make up that lost
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to Oklahoma and they're
going to Oregon and they're going to the
[SPEAKER_00]: desert in California and they're setting
up these huge depths and shops trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a total free for all in that
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like the, the level of
overproduction is insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody thinks that like,
it's going to get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, look, for just every person
that's quitting right now, there's another
[SPEAKER_01]: person doubling up their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another glass house putting up
another 5 million square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't going to get that much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to identify your own market and
then supply that market, whatever it is
[SPEAKER_01]: that you do, whether it's edibles,
vape pens, these turp carts, rosin,
[SPEAKER_01]: pick your, pick your thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the market can only sustain so much of
that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you start basically eating into
your own profits with your overproduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, like I said, as more people become
operational, more good operators come in,
[SPEAKER_01]: more good black market operators continue
to produce in more States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it fizzles out for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it just can't sustain the size of
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want like these people spent $300
million building this big grow because
[SPEAKER_01]: they were planning on doing a billion
dollars a year in sales, but they only got
[SPEAKER_01]: to 150 million a year in sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not really, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's going to be the reality
for a lot of these big businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you get these really big
overproduction situations, like you have
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, you're going to see people
shutting lights off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is, is like, as soon as the,
the, like, all right, let's say you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: 2000 light operation and you're going to
shut it down for the time being,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you have two of these,
let's say you shut one down and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, well, we'll just wait till the price
goes back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what happens when the price goes
back up?
[SPEAKER_01]: You flip the lights back on, fill it with
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a year later, the price is back where
it was again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is, you know, ag economics,
you know, this is just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the real question is how much COVID
cash did we spend on grows that don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: to exist?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's really big, which I think it
is, this overproduction will continue for
[SPEAKER_01]: quite some time, I would think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really it's, it's two giants with
a bunch of good weed growers getting
[SPEAKER_00]: smashed in the middle, in my opinion,
because it's like all the, like the two
[SPEAKER_00]: giants are like the, all the huge black
market things that have set up by the
[SPEAKER_00]: various groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other giant is all the
backdoor legal weed that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why legal is so pissed at
the black market is because for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: two, three years, they were dumping all
their excess product in the black easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was their cashflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, now they're getting cut off by
these ginormous scenes and they're pissed
[SPEAKER_00]: off about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's taking their price and it's
making their life harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but you know, so they want,
they want all the black to be shut down,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they only want the black to be shut
down so they could resupply the black.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just lost market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care about the white or black
sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want market share.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just need market share wherever
they're going to get it from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they define what's white and what's
black.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, they're the ones hiring the
lobbyists and are going to be hiring the
[SPEAKER_02]: lobbyists.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they define what's white and black
anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I, I worked on some,
on, on some big farms down in Southern
[SPEAKER_00]: California for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that the sales guy
did that was pretty trippy is he went and
[SPEAKER_00]: he looked at a bunch of the data for all
of the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was pretty much like, you know,
this farm that we have down here,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could probably supply like 80 or 90% of
the volume needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, kind of from the,
the, the real world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was kind of tripping out by this
number because he didn't know all the
[SPEAKER_00]: various nuances that we know, you know,
but he was just looking at it and he was
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about all the other bigger farms
than us and all the indoors and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: depths and all the everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, well, how is this
working?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way that the white market can
survive is if like 80% of them fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're, if they actually have to sell
within the state of California only and no
[SPEAKER_01]: back door exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the goal would be instead of like
two or three huge companies that suck,
[SPEAKER_00]: that that percentage would be a bunch of
bomb, small growers that could actually
[SPEAKER_00]: give consumers what they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what I'm getting at is that
it actually shrinks back to the size that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, that's actually sustainable for the
state of California, not including the
[SPEAKER_01]: export market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most of these big grows are too big
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're, they just can't get enough
revenue to sustain the business model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they, they have two choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: They either just shut off a bunch of
operations and keep their 200 million a
[SPEAKER_01]: year or whatever it is they could get or,
and they just hope they can hold onto that
[SPEAKER_01]: from little guys that keep chopping at
their, at their bottom line or at the top
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, this may go back the other
direction and people don't realize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if people focus on quality,
expanding their market instead of chopping
[SPEAKER_01]: off your fellow farmers market,
the black market operators or back door
[SPEAKER_01]: operators or whoever you are, you're going
to continue to see growth in your space
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be my, that's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could even say 20 years ago,
the people that I knew that were running
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 and a hundred lighters that were really
good at their job, they still bought their
[SPEAKER_00]: head stash from four to 10 to 12 lighters
because those that there's just something
[SPEAKER_00]: about like a, a smaller space that only,
that don't, you know, like you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can, there's like, nobody agrees where
craft ends, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody, nobody agrees when it's like,
it's just a little too big to be called
[SPEAKER_00]: craft, but I can, but everybody agrees
that the bigger it gets, the harder it
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes to manage perfect weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a guy that like works on his
four lighter after work and is in love
[SPEAKER_00]: with it and spends a couple hours in there
every night making it just exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: He probably has fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think as these, as this profit
margin continues to shrink, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got these big monster grows,
I think you're going to continue to find
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be continued to be difficult
for these big businesses to find employees
[SPEAKER_01]: that want to do that shit too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, where are you getting skilled
workers?
[SPEAKER_00]: From in this marketplace and my,
my buddy dude, uh, he jokes that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like a fucking factory job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're in there and the lights are on
and the fans are running and the decibels
[SPEAKER_00]: are loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you honestly should have like
protective glasses and some, and some
[SPEAKER_00]: debt, you know, and some ear muffs and
some good team.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's actually pretty fun because now
you don't have to man it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to be the guy like growing
weed for yourself is being that guy that's
[SPEAKER_01]: playing the, the, uh, he's got the whole
contraption on that playing like six
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's what the run in operating the
whole business is that, and for some
[SPEAKER_01]: people that's the right way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to control your product in
your market and your marketplace,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these big monster grows, especially
when the ownership has no soul or passion
[SPEAKER_01]: for the plant and doesn't want to fund any
kind of fun shit for their employees to do
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't think you're going to find
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find a lot of people that
want to continue to do that job long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, there's an aspect too,
where, um, and I want to say it before I
[SPEAKER_00]: forget, but when he was talking about
quality, the other thing that I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: that is actually going to lead to like the
next generation of like real elites is if
[SPEAKER_00]: people want to breed, uh, stop reading for
the market, cause that's going to change
[SPEAKER_00]: soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, start reading weed that you
personally think is fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to find weed that you and your friends
love to smoke and you love the buzz and
[SPEAKER_00]: you love things about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow better weed for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chances of that weed becoming popular
is way better than you trying to create
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you think will be popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow weed you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: My only business card and everybody that
knows me is a box of jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I show up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a box of jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can, cause I can tell you
pretty much everything about a grower from
[SPEAKER_01]: a box of jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you could, you should be able to,
you know, and there, and there's an aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: to where it's, it's, I mean, we haven't
even talked about like, if it went
[SPEAKER_00]: federally legal, like the international
market and how that would play into all
[SPEAKER_00]: this different stuff, you know,
because in each new, in each new state
[SPEAKER_00]: that goes legal, there's a bunch of
investment money hoping to like dominate
[SPEAKER_00]: and make a bunch of money back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of been swinging around the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it's in New York and New Jersey,
because those are huge places that are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming online and all these people are
super excited about trying to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Washington, where he,
he's up, you know, Washington and Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: were ahead of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't really learn any lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just, we just would shit the bed right
away or just like, oh, let's just make a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of terrible rules right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Destined for failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, that's, that may only make
sense for California.
[SPEAKER_02]: With how we do stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, it's, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say in all honesty, it's hard
because like he said, this is it's
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural, which has its own weird shit
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a multi, multi, multi billion
dollar industry already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like they get to create the
industry from the ground up and like
[SPEAKER_00]: tinker with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to bring this huge thing
into the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have no idea how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other thing have they ever done that
with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have they ever done?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's why, that's why some of
this money is so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 8 million pot smokers in my state
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge customer base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most things you make that are brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to build popularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed is super fucking popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's already popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and no one controls it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all tempting.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the money to be like, I want to
control that for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I agree rings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Colorado probably was falling out
for Kelly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was just like, I've been going
through having to delete all my old photos
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep my shit from getting my account
deleted and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, man, I was, I was like seeing
memes I was making in like 2017,
[SPEAKER_01]: 18, when everybody was talking about the
sky is falling and shit in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is just reality for an
agricultural crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not prepared for it and for
being flexible with how you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: operate your business, it's not going to
be, it's not going to be a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I will say too, and I never
really thought that I would see this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's an aspect where like maybe for
the first time, like being an actual weed
[SPEAKER_00]: nerd who really loves it as an advantage,
because then at least you get to love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You love what you're doing where a lot of
people got into this because it was easy
[SPEAKER_00]: or because it was money or because there
was a big margin or because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it allowed them travel freedom or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as, as it gets harder and harder,
they don't actually like doing what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get a lot more frustrated as the
market changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just another job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an, you know, and they used to
make a lot more for a lot less effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're making a lot less for a
lot more effort, you know, where,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's an, there's an aspect that I
see in Mendo all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably see it up there too in
Oregon, you know, where it's like a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of people that didn't really care about
weed, but learned enough to make money and
[SPEAKER_00]: run some big shit and make good money for
20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that it's going legal, they think they
have this like lifetime of knowledge about
[SPEAKER_00]: weed, but they really farmed most of it
out and they were in it for loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're really not that talented at
what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really don't have the same knowledge
base as like people that were nerdy about
[SPEAKER_00]: weed and kept wanting to learn about what
they were into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an aspect out there where for,
you know, like being, being like into weed
[SPEAKER_00]: helps because it's going to get rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The combo did go sideways, but sometimes
that's what's cool about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we could have talked about hash
plants for the last hour, I suppose in
[SPEAKER_00]: sequential order, you know, I mean,
man, who fucking cares.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking joints here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck do you guys want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you fucking bothering us for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to bring it back to hash plants or
whatever, probably in the, probably in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last five or six years, as people started
measuring returns on, on, on plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: people started making hash seriously for
the first time in America on a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: scale and trying to figure out what
cultivars and actually breeding for hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: which really wasn't done in the eighties,
nineties, two thousands, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody really, people were breeding for
flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, you know, people
weren't breeding for hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, frozen hash, which is, you know,
arguably some of the tastiest hash for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have the gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Americans like it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have like a village that we can
just be like, all right, for the next 12
[SPEAKER_00]: hours, all you families, you're,
you're like bashing weed over a screen
[SPEAKER_00]: with no, with no mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you watch some of those,
you watch, you watch some of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, some of those videos of what those
guys do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know how they don't have an
allergy attack, like every day of their
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they're just in a fucking huddle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've eaten all shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these allergies moved out and did
something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they had to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are desensitized people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's just a dust cloud you're
working in all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't deal with cannabis pollen,
you're not living in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the same thing is true too,
where it's like, there's a big push where
[SPEAKER_00]: like a lot of the popular hash strains,
they probably get popular because they
[SPEAKER_00]: yield great, not because they're the best
higher flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always that pressure too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the money versus quality pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one was one of the best hash plants
for me ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunk number one and it's hybrids from
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Sam bred the shit for making hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a resin farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he made the money that he made by
breeding a plant for 97% THC in the
[SPEAKER_01]: trichome head and then selling that as
technology to GW Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's his claim to fame right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like the only one that's done
that even.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did that shit back in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's an impressive feat.
Regardless.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something every breeder should be
impressed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But made a lot of, you know, the netter
hash and everything else that became
[SPEAKER_01]: popular and now is the water hash market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we were talking, we were talking
to Camara a while ago and he was talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about how he's never even seen Sam smoke
flower that he, you know, he breeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's a resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he called him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a resin farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: He likes to breed for resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he's after.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he's interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he cares about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's pretty dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: My bubble man doesn't smoke flower either.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of the same mentality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I consider sour diesel and the diesel
family to basically be like America's
[SPEAKER_00]: modern skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that very skunkoid, you know,
type, type, you know, plant type aromas,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not skunk one,
but it's definitely like it's in that
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's modern skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even just chem family stuff in
general is, I would almost say is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: similar, you know, big, tall running colas
on a lot of the hybrids, a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: longer flowering hybrid plant and,
you know, synonymous with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: good quality and commercial production.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only women enslaved smoke flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of my favorite quotes ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really funny quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really funny story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that when Sam Skunkman was in
Afghanistan looking for seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: he asked some of the muhajideen for flower
because he wanted the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy looked at him and was like,
only women enslaved smoke flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Men smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was basically like, are you a woman
or a slave?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had to explain that he wanted the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds from the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had no interest in the flower to smoke
whatsoever, but he wanted to make his own
[SPEAKER_00]: hash at home and he wanted the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that made sense to the dude,
but he was literally like women enslaved
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Men smoke hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I handed him a pair of chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, culturally, they're very
different, you know, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's an unprocessed product,
you know, and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if I was, if you just,
if you just grow a field of seed plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and randomly pick a flower to smoke,
it's probably not the greatest experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if the flower wasn't ever bred
for smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one of the, one of the things about
sativa is, is at least the, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they were breeding for the
flower itself to be smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one thing I find interesting that
everybody, you always see the comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a, um, a misconception in
cannabis breeding is that, Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: just go back to land race and it'll fix
whatever problems someone's talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Oh, all these are for me nowadays
because of this and this and that you
[SPEAKER_01]: should just go back to the land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, if you've ever grown lots
of land race varieties, it's the Tiva
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica, everything in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown tons of seeds from all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guaranteed the vast majority of them
have equal or higher amounts of
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphroditism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, the plants when you grow
them from seed and the flower seedless,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it has those little tiny black,
like those, and you'll like roll a joint
[SPEAKER_01]: up and it's like all these little black
specks on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've looked at them under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, I mean, it literally, it sounds like
you have spider mites in your,
[SPEAKER_01]: in your flower, but it's, I mean,
they're, they're tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are really common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know the Rastas pick those out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiny trichome heads or tiny trichome heads
and tiny calyxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, or bracts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the majority of what's in the
populations is those type of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the resin can be really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them, it smells good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really greasy is potent when you
smoke it, but the flower itself is just
[SPEAKER_01]: not desirable, has lots of growth
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Landrace is like whipping yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a lot of pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's turning back the clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then you, if you, if you think
that that's the way to fix a population or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, it's basically you
assuming that, Hey, I'm going to turn back
[SPEAKER_01]: the clock 50 years and I'm going to do
this myself from scratch and do a better
[SPEAKER_01]: job than all the people that have done it
between me and now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, dude, we're just lucky that
there was a decent population of plants
[SPEAKER_01]: for all of us to start with in the first
place, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like the goal is to at least make
hybrids and select for plants that'll
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to increase that quality so that
the next person that does that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that again, will continue to improve
the population better than you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's inadvertently how we've
gotten to where we are with all the her,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the feminized pollinate accidental
feminized pollination that gives us our
[SPEAKER_01]: main breeding population of today is
because it was always the best plants
[SPEAKER_01]: cross with the best plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause no one kept anything else for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gotten this question a few times,
so I'll ask it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up with your Malawi?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the sourcing on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That came from the glass scene up here in
Washington, but by way of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anything about who taught the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, or how it got here or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super, um, super like land race is like,
uh, uh, obsolete used it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, um, I think Caleb had it at one point,
I think, um, shot 707 seed bank had it for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ran it from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was, it was one of those plants
that had really strong, like hazy aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you smoke the flower.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said more like Eugene gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know when they were talking about
Malawi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that was another name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone called it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, we talked earlier about like
the weird Instagram stuff and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: that's been going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, one thing we're trying to put together
that I was going to talk about tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real quick before we're done is that we're
trying to put together the breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: syndicate social.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know like, I think Fletch,
you saw Flanbell's social thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was trying to put together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to use that similar type
platform so we can have a nerd IG for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll figure it out, but I wanted to at
least get that out there today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people have an idea to look for it for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, anything you're dropping soon,
Fletch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, maybe I don't know, but I'm not going
to plug shit on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just talking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool as fuck, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, not so.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I, I, we obviously had a
pretty wide ranging conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, I had a Malawi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's the same one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, how long did, did yours take forever
to finish?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like 90, 80, 90 days probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had this one and I never could get it
to, I needed to like, cap it starting in
[SPEAKER_00]: June, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and, and I never did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew it inside a few times and it
took twice as long as everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the hard part about having sativas
is you kind of need their own unique space
[SPEAKER_00]: for their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because otherwise you can't like
clean and reset and redo, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've just got this like, okay,
now I have three plants that are fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: forever in a day from being done.
