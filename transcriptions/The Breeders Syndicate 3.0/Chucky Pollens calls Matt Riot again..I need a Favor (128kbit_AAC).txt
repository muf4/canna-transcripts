[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Matt Wright, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why ain't you answering your fucking
phone, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I ain't trying to be a dick, and I feel
like I ain't being rude or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, when you said you got me all them
years ago, bro, like, I know we ain't
[SPEAKER_00]: talked for like seven or eight years and
I've been locked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit gets weird, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, ain't nobody came saw me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't come see me, shit pissed me
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I'm asking for,
bro, is a little fucking handout,
[SPEAKER_00]: dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's trying to piss me off on some real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a fucking little list here of all
the shit over the years that you fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: owe me for, and we're going to go through
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you had to do was pick up your fucking
phone, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, we got to do it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: First on the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: 17 Bic lighters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm out of the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: 17 Bic lighters and no cheap ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like 17 cases of beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four half gallons of Jose Cuervo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says anywhere from five to seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: $200 for food like McDonald's and shit
like that when we're hanging out and
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we got, looks like about $4,000 in
just weed money, shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You owe me for smoking you out,
shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, like we said, shit was cool,
but now that I'm thinking about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it ain't cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to need some money for this
shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like on the real, like real fucking fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just answer your phone, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need, I could go on for days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could just hook me up with a cool,
you know, six, I don't know, just like
[SPEAKER_00]: some lights, some tester shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you on your little podcast,
you know, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you could hook me up with a job on
there or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I see you making that sweet bread,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just wondering like, why can't you
help a G out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we were homies and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we were tight, but you know,
lock, I know I've been gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I'm wanting is a little Kim dog,
bro, to get me through the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few lights, some testers, shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get back up on my feet, you know,
shit like this, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard out here for, for a cat or
whatever, but it's just, I don't even know
[SPEAKER_00]: if this thing's on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been sending you texts anyways,
bro and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told mom like the fucking man ain't
answering and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought we were cool, but it ain't
looking like we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just being like a little baby bitch
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to dodge my phone calls,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm living in a fucking shack,
but damn near, I need some help,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just answer your phone now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chuckie ponds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: AKP body in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got locked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My life's hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well.
