[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_03]: clan-destined scene through the eyes of
the folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Notso Dog, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the first time we're trying
this on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're live.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Notso's out today.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's at a wedding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So today, I decided to bring in the homie
Smell Boat from Smell Boat Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Originally, when I was going to start the
first podcast, when I started doing live
[SPEAKER_03]: streams, this is who I was going to do
that with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he got busy with other stuff in life
and we're both donors, so we just lagged
[SPEAKER_03]: and never worked out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm super stoked to bring him on
because he's probably one of the people I
[SPEAKER_03]: have the most fun talking with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know everyone will super enjoy him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So without further ado, let me figure out
how to bring in a different background and
[SPEAKER_03]: add in my buddy Smell Boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's me, Smell Boat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Brad?
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad to have you, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad to have you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to first start talking about
what is Smell Boat?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the first question everybody has
is, what the fuck is the name Smell Boat
[SPEAKER_03]: from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So video games.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long ago, there used to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably still around, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was like 20, 19, so 25,
26 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to play this game called
Counter-Strike.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my name was Smell Boat on Smell Boat
Captain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smell Boat Captain.
[SPEAKER_01]: The captain of the Smell Boat on
Counter-Strike.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sucked to get killed by the Smell
Boat captain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the captain of the fucking Smell
Boat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So did you just combine two words?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, like Carl Larry was another thing
when I was all like in Nintendo,
[SPEAKER_01]: when they would save baseball games,
they would save players.
[SPEAKER_01]: Names.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be all Carl Larry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my baseball players were always Carl
Larry.
[SPEAKER_01]: My shooter games were always Smell Boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what's the point of coming up with
something, you know, cool?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the first thing I see is people like,
what is a Smell Boat scene?
[SPEAKER_00]: The fuck is a Smell Boat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a human.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fucking human.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we first started talking on the forums
back in the day and then it first became
[SPEAKER_03]: like really good friends pretty much at
the beginning of Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: We first started talking really heavily.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at some point, like we had always
talked about hanging out because we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: live terribly far from each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're both Valley Boys, like Central
Valley Boys, not San Fernando Valley Boys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at some point we made a decision to go
on this trip to Emerald Cup together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you went full well knowing everybody
wanted to kill my ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you were just there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to punch the motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were just there just to like help me
from losing my shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you had some seeds and you had some
killer bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go have a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we brought a PD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can actually, let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to show off a PD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go show off a PD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to take out these stupid things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a PD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's find the PD.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a PD bird.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brother from another mother.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that young fella, God, what was he
like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Early twenties when he went with us and he
had never done shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not even 30 yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had never done any kind of anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had helped me with like some local
shows and things like that because I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: like people too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was going reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did all the talking, you know,
he would sell all my shit and I could
[SPEAKER_01]: just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember being dead, fucking dead
running that boot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember the NCGA booth?
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember the booth?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember us getting kicked out of
the booth like four times?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I got kicked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lady was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lady just stared at me like the NCGA's
wife.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She hated me so hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_03]: She changed her feelings from hating me to
liking me to hating me again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And eventually we had to move on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it was just chaotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I remember dying, like falling asleep
and PD found the only cup of coffee and
[SPEAKER_03]: all of Emerald Cup after chasing one for
two hours for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to throw props to PD in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, uh, had fucking carried all of our
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd make multiple trips back and forth
through the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a brutal weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, that was, uh, I don't think we
got back to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, remember we didn't get there until
like two or three in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had dinner and people wanted
to meet at Denny's cause it was the only
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking place open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get sick off of anything that,
you know, that isn't food I make.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I couldn't fucking eat the entire
weekend except for that one place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember that little tiny like
restaurant cafe that we found and with the
[SPEAKER_01]: pie, the lady had all those homemade pies
and she was closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were fucking like walked up and
we're all, Oh, please open.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bought all of her shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bought all of her fucking pie,
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're still like, just give us all the
fucking pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the kitchen was fucking close.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went back to the hotel with like 40
pies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just went and took your money from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I counted it, wrote that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the next day I was like 40 times
more tired, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's right though.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got there at like one or two in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have the foods, didn't get to
the hotel until like three or four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it had to be at the show like at
nine in the morning or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We stayed way too fucking long on day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We stayed, we stayed until the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then day two, I had to do the
interviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had to do that commercial thing
with Microblyfe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dude, we were so fucking exhausted.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were all like, can we just go?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we were going to stay another
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can make the drive, you two just sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just drove like six fucking hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, just go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did it somehow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the weekend at the Golden Coast
thing too, now that I think of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, that was when that really got
handsome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's his name too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Swerve was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what's his, one of the big dudes,
I thought it was the Hawaiian guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grayskull?
[SPEAKER_03]: He was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't Grayskull.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of the other big dudes wanted
to beat the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to settle him down too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Grayskull and he wanted to beat
the shit out of the Golden Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Grayskull.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had found out about what would happen
with me and Dave and he already wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: kick his ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, dude, he's not going to
fight.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just keeps calling for lawyers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even worth fucking punching.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a fun trip when I went out to
Maui and visited Grayskull and Joey and
[SPEAKER_01]: them too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish you could have been there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Killer weed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was supposed to get in on a Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I basically sat in the airport all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they flew me to LA because I don't
like to drive to the big airport,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'll fly out to the little airports
just because I don't want to leave my car.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sat in the airport for like nine fucking
hours and then they fly me to LA where I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to go to San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I get there and my plane had
already left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I had to stay in a hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get to the hotel until like one
or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to be at the airport back at five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did meet John Sally that morning and we
smoked before we went to the airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, then I flew out and I was
supposed to go to that show, but they lost
[SPEAKER_01]: all my luggage and it had like my whole
quarter pound in it for the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had fucking everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, and then I get there and
I'm like, come to the show, come to the
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, dude, I've airport lived
for like two straight days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll come and see you guys tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fucking brutal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, those fucking pies back to the
pies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish to God, I wish to God I knew the
name of that restaurant and that fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those pies was so goddamn good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly couldn't tell you what any of
those, I can't even tell you what any of
[SPEAKER_03]: them tasted like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just remember being a fat kid,
rubbing my face with like three different
[SPEAKER_03]: kinds.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had like all these different quarter
of a pie, half of a pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's all, well, what do you want
slices of?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I literally saw, just give us all the
pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just empty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she looked at us like we were fucking
stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like, no, no, for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just give us all the pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she, I think she ended up making
us food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can't even, she would, they were
fucking close though.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, that was the nicest old
lady in history.
[SPEAKER_01]: How the hell did we even get her to open a
door for our scumbag ass?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have fucking no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know three dudes standing outside
drooling pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they ended up eating there the
next day as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we went there twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we probably did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have no recollection.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were people I met that weekend and
hands I shook and I couldn't, I was so
[SPEAKER_03]: tired.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been more tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the, I, that was the,
the interview with the other, that kid,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Australian kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the, the commercial thingy with
microbe life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so fucking out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even remember like make saying
where I don't remember it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I know we went and did it because we
did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But did you do an interview with your,
one of your brothers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, with, with, with, yeah, with my
brother, with the cool brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, with the cool brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was the other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was, it was, it was fucking mad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old Brian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to do a brother interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we always, I mean, you know,
we were brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, it was good until he became a
weirdo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, for people not watching,
don't know if you're familiar with mad
[SPEAKER_03]: farmer seeds, this is his biological
brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like biological.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not just saying like, Hey,
is this a brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: Same mom, same dad, same grew up together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's, he's been around to see all of
that company forming, but he was always
[SPEAKER_03]: doing his own thing at the same time in a
different area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about how you started,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we've never covered it on the
syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been covered elsewhere, but I'd like
to cover it just to, just to jump off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I grew up around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like literally I remember the first
plants I actually grew myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: I hid in the front yard of a small town in
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause my dad had got caught with 180 kilos
and we left California, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: obvious reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we moved to Oklahoma because it's a
much more lenient state in the eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, why wouldn't we go to Oklahoma?
[SPEAKER_01]: So just honestly, the whole story is my
grandfather was the chief of police.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad's brothers were both sheriffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad got caught with 180 keys,
did a couple of months when he went to
[SPEAKER_01]: court.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no marijuana left.
[SPEAKER_01]: The marijuana had vanished.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they let him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went to my grandma's, grabbed a bunch
of pounds out of the attic and we drove to
[SPEAKER_01]: Oklahoma and lived there forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: For four or five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like things could calm down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really didn't know, like,
I think I was like, I mean, my first
[SPEAKER_01]: memories in life were always smelling
scuffs and shit, you know, like my dad
[SPEAKER_01]: would come in with giant black trash bags
full of weed, you know, and trim it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: house and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure I always went to school smelling
like marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when Reagan and them started
the dare program, the cops always wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to talk to me and I didn't ever understand
why, you know, but I had the rundown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew what was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, I grew this little,
these little plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to collect other seeds and my uncle
would mow the yard like once a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he went out and mowed the yard and
there was these giant pot plants in the
[SPEAKER_01]: front yard, literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was the first time I grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got obsessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everywhere we'd go fishing,
I would grow little plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd go and grow, put little seeds in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would literally start,
I started to learn that if I put paper
[SPEAKER_01]: bags over the top of the plants,
it would make them flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would leave little paper bags and
we'd come back the next weekend and I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: take the paper bag off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there'd be like these little
eight inch plants that had started to
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't want to smoke it or anything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like, you know, fucking around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my first really big growth is when I
got out of the army, I was pretty mentally
[SPEAKER_01]: busted up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my brain was fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had went through a bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh God, it's a long story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was looking for a place to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was what I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about 1997.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to like spend a summer
away, check out and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a little town here called
Three Rivers, there, Three Rivers,
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right at the base of the Sequoias.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went up there and a friend of mine's
brother had this big side of a mountain
[SPEAKER_01]: that was completely, there's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was right off of the road, no roads,
no water, no anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my bright idea was to, hey,
let's start growing on the side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: mountain and let's grow from the bottom
all the way up to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to climb this mountain every
fucking day that doesn't have water with
[SPEAKER_01]: water on my back, like a mule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do it and I'm killing it,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these plants are getting big and
they're getting beautiful and spring
[SPEAKER_01]: comes, you know, and the rains come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we used to get a pretty good amount
of rain and I started getting these.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a creek that ran down it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started setting up these big 300
gallon water troughs down into the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the creek ran, it captured it and it
made that life a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one day I was hauling ass,
like running from the top of the hill down
[SPEAKER_01]: to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I fell through the fucking ground and
it was a goddamn rattlesnake pit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never, I never knew that
rattlesnakes like get together,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, like thousands of fucking
rattlesnakes will like turn into a ball
[SPEAKER_01]: and do rattlesnake shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the fuck they were
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fell into this hole, like thigh deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounded like a buzzsaw went off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ran and I never went back and I
never checked on my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, fuck that grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking falling into rattlesnakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I was so freaked the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the following year, I didn't grow
on that land anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this old rancher guy up in Squaw
Valley who had 180 acres or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had this old movie set on it and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in the seventies or eighties,
they were doing a Western movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was literally a facade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you go down the road and it was just
like faces of these old saloons and motel
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had built this massive fucking
hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the fireplace in this hotel is like
the size of my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was completely flooded out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the story has it is that they were
doing a Western and the movie never got
[SPEAKER_01]: made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when the people who were like
paying for the movie showed up,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was just a bunch of people running
around naked doing LSD and coke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they pulled the plug on the movie,
left everything up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy bought it, turned it into like a
huge cattle ranch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically just let me have free will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that year I hit a thousand pounds off
the floor with two fucking workers and was
[SPEAKER_01]: so in over my fucking head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dude, back then it was worth so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was worth way, way, way more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be driving through town at three
or four in the morning with the back of
[SPEAKER_01]: the truck, just trash bags just filled up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all filled with pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like, yeah, just driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't look at me, cop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of crazy what you think you can
get away with back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you end up getting away with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank fucking God, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd still be in prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I would still be in prison to this
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so that's why you remember like you
had brought up, like we used to talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was, I always thought it was
overgrown, but you had, you corrected me
[SPEAKER_01]: today and said the other name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: C Depot was, C Depot is where I first met
your brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have been earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where your brother first made his name and
like made a bunch of quotes was on C
[SPEAKER_03]: Depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that still existed, things would be
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: C Depot, you and I would talk and it was
funny because it was basically because my
[SPEAKER_01]: name was smellboat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a lot of pictures of stuff and
everyone was all, what the fuck is this
[SPEAKER_01]: shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I was like, Oh, it's just
stuff I'm growing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody at the time were growing
these little tiny indoor, like one light
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had these monster fucking fields,
like sides of fucking mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was never on line though,
because I had a job, a thousand pounds.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dude, I was so exhausted back in those
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and then I had, I just fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once again, I got so tired and fed up
with the partner back then kind of had the
[SPEAKER_01]: falling out kind of had him 16s pointed at
me at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was only a little bit out of the
infantry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I also was handy with weapons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it crossed my mind to go and take what
was mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I thought better of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made, I made enough to be happy and
build a really big, nice indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of where I got my indoor
grow was from that bullshit, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my indoor grow just got bigger
and bigger and bigger and more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once again, I got too fucking
busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I like to do everything by my
goddamn self.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when they have lupus and shit,
like you're all like, I'm going to take on
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking 64 lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I find myself laying on the
couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything hurts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but I kind of covered the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that covers the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that covers the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seed part though, you remember me
telling you all the time, like I used to
[SPEAKER_01]: be obsessed with like one branching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I would just have males and to
preserve the genetics, I would literally
[SPEAKER_01]: take a male and see that one branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that branch would get kept in
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my collection of seeds is absolutely
fucking massive of one branching,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of different types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got really, really serious
about it when I hallucinated from that
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolate cherry one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Made me feel like I was on mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was all like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be, it's too strong for
me, but I know these potheads that are
[SPEAKER_01]: over here in the fucking chat are going to
be all, I love getting really fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, we're going to work with
this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was way too fucking strong for my ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was way too strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the clockwork orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people would ask me like about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's not what I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that it's too strong in a way
that I don't like, you know, it interacts
[SPEAKER_03]: with me to where it fucks me up in a
paranoid kind of, yeah, not fun way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like fun ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so some of your first releases,
were those with, when we were releasing
[SPEAKER_03]: them for a season, those are your first
releases?
[SPEAKER_03]: You talked to me into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't talk to the best guys into it,
keeping seeds around it and making seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: and joining the seed revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like three years of y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to release seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was singing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was during, a lot of it was during the
beginning of the cookies era and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it, but it was right at that point
where we were like, okay, we're sick of
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're sick of seeing cookie stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's unique with cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you found a way to make some of the
most beautiful, absolutely beautiful,
[SPEAKER_03]: but still wreckingly potent shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about what you were working
with to get to that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So funny how this worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a website called Kanazan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I remember Kanazan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kanazan, I had a really good friend on
Kanazan that went by the name Smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was from Canada and that is where I
sourced that chocolate of the chocolate
[SPEAKER_01]: tie crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rev, I got the cherry for the cherry tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rev's cherry tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how tie-y-tie it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's tie-it for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a few different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's two totally different
males.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with more females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two C, flowering tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what Rev was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't want a 90 to 120 day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's trying to get it down to 80 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I fucked around and used, a male from
Rev's cherry because Smoke could send me
[SPEAKER_01]: these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to tell you more about that too,
but Smoke could send me these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Smoke was hilarious, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were ever on Kanazan, you would
know who he was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was banned from day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: One liter bottles, clear plastic soda
bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was his growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had these tiny little like T5,
T8 looking bulbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he grew up really pretty flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But every grow, he did one branching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how we became friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I told him about like,
oh my God, dude, this is how I used to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he sent me literally like 10 seeds of
everything he had ever done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he loved like black rose, white rhino,
white widow.
[SPEAKER_03]: He sounds familiar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure I knew who he was from Poptemp or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: He spoke French better than English.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I used to translate all these back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could still use fucking translator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would write it in English,
translate it all into French and send it
[SPEAKER_01]: to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turned out fucking horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still email with him at least once a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he still has 12 of the original
chocolate seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said his So he stabbed somebody a few
years back.
[SPEAKER_01]: He called them gorillas, tried to rob
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He stabbed one of them, had to go do this
whole court thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's on probation, all this shit,
just crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, as soon as everything dies
down, those seeds are mine so I can look
[SPEAKER_01]: deeper into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, dude, I still don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: He called it chocolate tie number one,
two, three, seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just it's little plastic bags,
marker, and lots of numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy fuck, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I hit that with the revs,
I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people who got to smoke it,
it was literally like a chocolate cherry
[SPEAKER_01]: candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might even have pictures of this now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was some milky chocolate with a cherry
finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was fucking stunning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the one that made me
hallucinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I went and laid in bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's with the rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the chocolate cherry with back
to rainbow back into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because chocolate cherry, I took a male
from that and hit triangle with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that made what I ended up finding my
red vine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I took a male from red vine and
OGKB had just hit the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it super intrigued my ass because it
looked like duck foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: This plant I used to get called duck foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like some of the urkel mutants
that we used to find in seeds and shit
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it intrigued the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a cut of it and I hit it with the
chocolate cherry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The OGKB didn't get me super ripped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I could smoke a joint of it and be
like, oh, I'm chill, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wanted to see what this crazy 12
foot fucking mongoloid plant and this
[SPEAKER_01]: weirdo slow plant would do when they got
after it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the red vine was that medium though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got the chocolate cherry in there
now that I created.
[SPEAKER_01]: That with triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I found red vine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, red vine isn't the name of that cross
because I used to not name my crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think this is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red vine was that mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a certain plant named red vine
because it tasted like the licorice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so a male from that went to OGKB
the first fucking seed I found,
[SPEAKER_01]: I started to flower it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked at it and I was like,
God damn, that plant's special.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a bud off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put it back into and cloned it and
everything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a little shoot came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rainbow almost never happened because it
was the first seed I fucking popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my eye told me that I didn't take a
clone off of it because it's the first
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that first fucking seed I went and
took a little white headed flower later
[SPEAKER_01]: on, because I liked the structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked everything about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That bitch started to get resin like in
week two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing hairs and resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it ended up reveging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually think I took like 12 clones off
of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Off of the fucking plant with the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something was telling me that this
plant, there's something about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took a ton of fucking cuts off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them came out quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next ones took a little longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one that took over a fucking
year to actually finally grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of that little white tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by then I had already flowered her
ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mothered, grown, flowered.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you kept it around anyways because you
struggled to live?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still kept that bitch because I was
like, bitch, you're going to live forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're going to keep fighting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let you live.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember I had a train wreck and it was
when I decided to get rid of train wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I took it out and it was like the last
clone in a solo cup at the time in an
[SPEAKER_03]: apartment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took it out and I set it on a table.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I swear to God, two weeks later,
I went by and looked and that bitch was
[SPEAKER_03]: still alive, just living there on the
table.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I guess I'll keep you again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it died.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, after that it died.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear to God, they can survive in the
worst shit, but once you bring them back
[SPEAKER_01]: and try to rebaby them, they're like,
no, we don't like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You manually gut something accidentally.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted the fucking balling gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to show these off because
someone sent these in today.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy Skidwilla, I showed you these
earlier, but these are the Riot Seeds wall
[SPEAKER_03]: art knuckle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He made my logo 3D and made it perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You showed me some other ones today too
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually our colors of our logo
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Artists signed on the back, ACAB666.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's firmly mounted behind me now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to thank Skidwilla for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always going to be right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Skidwilla, for all the hard
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to throw in some props.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk what you've been doing the past
few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same shit I always do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go into a shell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go into me time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to get away from everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: My breeding projects, I'm probably four or
five projects in since the fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: original Rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: People kept asking me for female seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a female project with both reversing
Rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't like how Rainbow reversed.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was hard to reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took Sis and Sister reversed a lot
easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those female seeds are pretty fucking
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish my buddy was in the chat right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see if he's in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, the podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking for... I don't want to say
his real name and I forgot his fucking...
[SPEAKER_01]: His name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to get to some of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to take a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's baked to a crisp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish baked was in here because Rainbow's
sister is like Rainbow, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: She's more purple and you get more of this
chocolate menthol than you do with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a hard to explain, pine-ish funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you smoke Rainbow in a room and you
know... Let's say I went down to your
[SPEAKER_01]: house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've smoked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could go to your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could smoke whatever you wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could come in there and know when you
smoked Rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: She leaves this essence in the fucking air
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't really explain.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sister, I can explain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really carried the smoothness of
chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you don't get the berry or any of
that back on the back end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like mint ball chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like one of those peppermint
patties, but I don't want to say that
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the one that Bryn liked,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The chocolate...
[SPEAKER_01]: The chocolate fino of the Rainbow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I reversed her and that's where I
made a whole bunch of fucking films with
[SPEAKER_01]: her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I crossed so many strains that I actually
liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually liked Wedding Cake,
so it's one of the newer strains that I
[SPEAKER_01]: liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I did a bunch of old stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Triangle, the San Diego cut, which you
have to grow or see because it's one that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've talked about for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, what else did I... Fucking Great
Pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great Pie Cross was great, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urkel, SR-71, Urkel, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking I swear, they're the same plants
that just kind of veered off into two
[SPEAKER_01]: different algorithms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just got just a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was one of the first projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember, you were sending me the
reversal spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like three fucking years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like when we went to the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it was when I got home,
I sent you some spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sent me the spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I did another rainbow,
the Triangle by Rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to make some... I started
obsessing over the old OGs, like
[SPEAKER_01]: unhealthily, like obsessing with the old
OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took a Triangle by Rainbow and
started hitting all my old OG cuts and
[SPEAKER_01]: making regular seeds out of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did that project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and holy shit, there are some OGs
that are coming out of there that you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: get to see that are... It's like,
holy fuck, like you actually did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of brought OG, like the OGs I
remember back into the fold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, OGs of nowadays are very different
than what we remember, the dank old OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can think of a few different
expressions that I'm used to seeing in
[SPEAKER_03]: OGs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And anything past that, I don't really
consider.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't consider it OG because they
weren't the original expressions of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I've got like that old burnt rubber,
that old acrid shit coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get that fucking lemon pine salt shit
coming out of some of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some really nice expressions out
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, I grow... I have always bred
for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just so happens that people like
the same kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like the same kind of stuff I
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the stuff I breed, people like,
my flowers never are going to be your
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest yielder in your room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not what the fuck I look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not something you breed for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what I breed for, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I breed for... First, I like flavors,
and that's why I started obsessing over
[SPEAKER_01]: the OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss the gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss that gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss... And people say gas, but there's
so much more complexity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were just talking, there was that
acrid bile smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the fucking garlicky funky gym
socks smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just those bad smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started missing that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was sweet now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was fucking the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we all end up.
Purple punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was fucking purple punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not shitting on purple punch when I
say that, but everything started to look
[SPEAKER_01]: like fucking purple punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or cookies, or gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then gelato was like ice cream cake,
and ice cream cake is back to purple punch
[SPEAKER_01]: looking shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why when I brought up wedding cake,
because it is one of the newer ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's all, hey, that's pretty fucking
nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice and piney and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people still like wedding cake,
despite it being all hypey and in a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, it still is a pretty good plant,
despite all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to find some good questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: When was the first time you remember
seeing Urkel, Snelly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking Christ, 99, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: 99-ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: 99-ish, I think, right around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know at the time it was actually
called purple Urkel, at the time when I
[SPEAKER_01]: started first seeing the purple strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those purple strains ended up becoming
a lot of different fucking names.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started first seeing those real purple
strains in Northern California in that
[SPEAKER_01]: 90s, so everything that was coming out was
these big giant green spears, and then all
[SPEAKER_01]: of a sudden these little purple flowers,
and Jesus Christ, it set the world ablaze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew a lot of Urkel, a lot of fucking
Urkel, but I'm allergic to Urkel,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm not allowed to grow it anymore
because the kid's allergic to it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember you saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally, the terpenes in the air,
the pollen it produces, it drips me to
[SPEAKER_01]: shreds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes my immune system attack myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck that plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't grow it no more.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned you have an immune disorder
too, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you find that works best for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drinking lots of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weed-wise, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good combos of sativas that don't get
you jittery, but it still gets you that
[SPEAKER_01]: motivation where I can get up and move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I had AFib to go with my autoimmune
disease and have had heart surgery and
[SPEAKER_01]: been shocked fucking so many times back to
life, I cannot get elevated because my
[SPEAKER_01]: heart's been up in the 240s before.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hit in the crack pipe, and I'm all,
actually, I don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to die, so you might want to
fucking do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: The super sativas, and that's why I love
to breed with them, but I have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: really careful when I first breed with
them, so my first rounds after I smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: them and stuff, I usually will take one
hit and just see where it's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if I don't get too elevated,
I start to lean into it more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That combination, man, and I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I seen somebody had mentioned CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like smoking almost like hemp flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some hemp flowers now that smell
good, taste good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that podcast, the shapeshifter cut
came from who's those dudes who do cement
[SPEAKER_01]: shoes and- Coal Classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coal Classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that cut from one of the cats,
Marcus Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Coal Classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty good cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I worked with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed that cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what else we got here for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the questions we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone was asking about- I have to answer
this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blockhead by Black Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Black Sativa is an unknown fucking
sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: The man who gave that to me is past.
[SPEAKER_01]: He died years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: He handed me some amazing strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have the Blockhead by Black Sativa
with the rainbow and she's a beaut,
[SPEAKER_01]: just know that that came from a special
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what Black Sativa is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming it's China Black or
Vietnamese Black or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called that shit garbage barge because
it literally smelled like raw the trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: The garbage barge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Blockhead by Black Sativa is a special
girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to mention that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about when Smelly ran into Afgu
first?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any experience with Afgui?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure Afgui would never stay in
veg for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: She would just always pre-flower
constantly and it pissed me off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran her for a little while and that was
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't one of the ones that for me that
I was working with religiously.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a lot of experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like you were bringing up,
you had what was the AK-47.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had an AK-47 Afgui cross that literally
just flowered under 24 hours away.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking amazing, but you constantly
took clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't keep it in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't keep it in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my experience with the Afgui and
it made me sad because it's a good fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't made for my mom room,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we bottlenecking boys?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what that means.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people are confused about what
bottlenecking means in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if you notice, you can cross things
into each other, try to make it a uniform
[SPEAKER_03]: line and still can't happen in cannabis
and if that can't happen, how are you
[SPEAKER_03]: bottlenecking anything really?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can increase inbred traits in
blueberry without bottlenecking too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think blueberry was so deep into its
lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, 15, 20 times in?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one that I ended up with, I have no
idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said that DJ was supposedly an F4
when they got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some dude worked at four generations,
another dude worked at another four
[SPEAKER_03]: generations and somehow kept the blueberry
smell without looking anything like
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry or having mutations.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really interesting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did rowdy fly fishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did get some lots of different Kims from
our friend in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a var- was a variegation cut of
the fucking Kim.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had a cis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he had one labeled Kim cis,
Kim 91, and then the D.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kim D was a good plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all of them were nice green,
like the kind of shit I like to smoke,
[SPEAKER_01]: so no complaints for me at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did finally, and I worked with Kim a
bit as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never really been a Kim person
myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Kim 91 itself, I don't like smoking it
too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's ugly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is ugly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually did okay with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I could make her look decent enough,
but no, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: She doesn't find her way to the garden
very often because I do have these other
[SPEAKER_01]: OG cuts that I love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody said something about a legend
rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a legend OG by rainbow and one of
the crosses recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one did you like out of the OGs that
you've crossed to rainbow, which is your
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite?
[SPEAKER_01]: The San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: San Diego OG?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Triangle with rainbow, it really brings a
lot of triangle because you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: triangle in rainbow and triangle there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get a lot of OG, but this San
Diego, I, once again, I wish one of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: a friend of mine, he's actually a really
good friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, that girl right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow pretty weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, the fucking that skittles by rainbow
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the name of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the name of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fluttershy I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so both of these are fluttershy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look like the same plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both fluttershy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's funny is that is two different
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one's in my garden and one's in a
friend's garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one do you think's in my garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like your photos, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: See the underneath shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one from up under.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's, that one's mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks like yours on the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That fucking stupid skittles by rainbow
cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look almost identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fella who grew that one on the
left, I call him meat hands because he
[SPEAKER_01]: breaks everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, is that the dude that I met?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ham hands if we're being specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ham hands make that bitch look like
that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I love pot again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, me and him talk quite often.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly believe blue dreams and skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly believe it, especially with
crossing with it and seeing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen like blue dream looking plants
come out of that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's a trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might not be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know where you sourced your
skittles cut at?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it from the, okay, so you know the
guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I'm just going to say,
no, I'm not going to say his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually know him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's from slow San Luis Obispo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: He used to always be with Gage in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he worked with the, what are they
called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Turpogs or whatever the fuck those dude's
names are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before skittles became cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was moving all their outdoor for him of
the skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit was brown as fuck, but it had a good
nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got it from him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So skittles is an ugly ass plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ugly as fuck flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just, I don't think the, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking wanting to be brown,
but with rainbow, rainbow is, Hey buddy,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's fuck right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this thing right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a, did you guys down there run into
the kind and if so, was it traceable back
[SPEAKER_03]: to DJ or Washington growers?
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember just a kind bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's, that's how I remember it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we were getting back then,
like coming out of the Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would just call kind bud or green bud
or Humboldt and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the kind bud was more like a term for
like, what is the new side exotic and shit
[SPEAKER_01]: like that's used now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used kind bud in the nineties to
describe, you know, good green buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have seeds from those green buds
that we were getting out of Humboldt in
[SPEAKER_01]: the nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's literally on pieces of scratch
paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have wrote it in pencil and it says
Humboldt on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one would say Humboldt IBL.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one would say like Humboldt
green.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, most of them are like pale tan
white shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been in the freezer now for 20
years, but I kept them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I doubt I would, uh, I think we'd
have to have them get actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, like embryonic rescue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, and I don't even know if it would be
worth it because so you would get pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you go through the pounds at the
bottom of the pounds, you'd find a few
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, you know, and when you were selling
the pounds, you didn't want the buyers to
[SPEAKER_01]: see the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd pull the seeds out of all the
pounds as they were coming down from up
[SPEAKER_01]: North.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so I grew a bunch of those up in,
uh, when I did the thousand pound group,
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of that was the Humboldt stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the last time I smelled scum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the last time I smelled scum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still have some of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there's definitely going to be some
scunk scents in some of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the only reason why I would
consider like trying to, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: pop them because I don't think they would
grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't think so, but there's still
like DNA inside of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's disappointing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if they don't grow and then you
wonder if you wasted that tissue for
[SPEAKER_03]: potential DNA shit later down the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you, I showed you the pictures of
the stuff I had from my dad's prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was in prison and it was, he sent me
fucking seeds because he's a weirdo.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this fucking little correctional
envelope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those seeds were all like fossilized
literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like crystallized on the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: No idea what those fucking seeds were.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if he was sending them to me,
uh, that was his last jail stint.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't like when I was a baby,
but later in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're sending me seeds of gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: These must be special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then somehow they got put into a box
and that box got put in jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who fucking knows that guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, supposedly I was conceived while he
was in jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I can see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my mom just got a cruise out there,
you know, like, Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to, yeah, we're going to
make a fucking baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good way to get, that's a good
way to know that you're special is when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're, when your mama went to jail to
make babies into this world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all like, ah, I heard you were
conceived when you were in jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So someone's asking, are those chocolate,
uh, Thai seeds, small, medium or large?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well, you, I have some that are tiny,
tiny ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have also bred some that are
large.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think it really depends like the
male, sometimes the male lets the little
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the weird thing with some of the
Thai ones is you'll get these really big
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking airy, weird seeds, like,
like almost wiped seeds in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're, they're, they grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they, they look pale, but they still
fucking grow, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, I think a lot of it is because I
don't want to let her go for 487 days to
[SPEAKER_01]: become black seeds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have some, uh, that are really tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when was the, the, was it the green,
the green, green tie?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what'd they call that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a green something tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smallest seeds I've ever seen are
those African seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ugandan seeds are like the size of a
pinhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they are like tiny, like some of them
are fucking like little bitty black
[SPEAKER_01]: specks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had some from the Mekong Delta.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Delta nine labs used to sell them the,
the, they were the Mekong haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: He called them, but there's no haze in it,
but it was just a Cambodian land race.
[SPEAKER_03]: It went 26 weeks, but they were tiny,
tiny, tiny black.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiny black as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like black as yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were tiny little shits,
but the Thai seeds are weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've seen variations of the Thai,
but, uh, once again, though, like I do,
[SPEAKER_01]: I only had so many pure Thai seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds at the time, like it wasn't like I
had an infinite supply of those fuckers,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, uh, with, uh, revs revs Thai
seeds, I actually still have three of the
[SPEAKER_01]: original seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found the cherry and I have,
I have like 20 or 30 of those cherry ties
[SPEAKER_03]: left.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're, they're decent size seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not like, yeah, they're normal,
a normal fucking seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, someone asked about if you're working
any cool Thai or Southeast Asians,
[SPEAKER_03]: where is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, any cool Thai Southeast Asian plant,
uh, varieties in the vault you're planning
[SPEAKER_03]: on working with in the near future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, everything with rainbow has lots of
Thai and I've backed it to cherry Thai.
[SPEAKER_01]: I backed it to chocolate Thai.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I, I love my ties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and like we were talking about like
finding the ties that the hot room,
[SPEAKER_01]: that mushroom filling, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That took away all my pain, but it's
scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to do a lot of fucking LSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me just put that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of fucking LSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having flashbacks from weed isn't fun,
but it's all what the fuck is going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I started seeing submarine sandwiches
walking around on the ceiling and how easy
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all, Oh my God, I am so fucking high
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, I will forever work with
Thai.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I, I just like, I like, I know some
people, you know, don't like the structure
[SPEAKER_01]: and don't like the stretch and those
things, but I like to take a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: put it in the flower and have her grow
into, you know, a tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I flip, I don't want to veg for two
and three fucking months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't want to grow leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: The electricity in California is so
fucking expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The least amount of time for growing
leaves, the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like my plants to stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some people fucking hate it,
but that's a warning when you buy things
[SPEAKER_01]: with rainbow, you might find a mutant,
but you might find the most stretching
[SPEAKER_01]: plant you've ever seen in your fucking
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like wild fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep, keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep that fucking minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause somebody's going to get a pack of a
sister's S ones tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you want to, how do we want to do
the giveaway?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's going to get a pack of the S
one, uh, rainbow sister that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: obsessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, how can, what can we do to give it
away?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Random person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like guess a number.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll write a number down and everyone.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless like three people guess the same
number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever guesses it first.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's the RVK work coming along?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love red vine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will forever ever work with red vine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did red vine by rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I am going to be reworking.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a new male from those seeds
eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I was saying, I have so many
fucking, I'm just a critter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know how to explain myself
with seeds other than like a fucking inch
[SPEAKER_01]: critter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like I just got to itchy about and
fucking work and work and work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, usually, uh, Welsh, uh, you will find
a keeper in every pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, most of the people on here who have
bought seeds from me would, I would hope
[SPEAKER_01]: would vouch, uh, vouch for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, um, found something that they enjoyed
in my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, let's see somebody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: What should I grab to find that lemon
pledge?
[SPEAKER_03]: OG profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a good OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the San Diego by rainbow or even the
triangle by rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the San Fernando Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, so I did work SFV with rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I did across with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I started hearing some weird shit
about SFV and, and, uh, that there was
[SPEAKER_01]: lies tied with it and, uh, some other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I only released those to some friends
as freebies and shit like that and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I never sold any of, I don't think
I sold it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we sold any of SFV by
rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I just gave them away as freebie
packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll also find out when you buy seeds
from me, I am way too fucking generous and
[SPEAKER_01]: just go, here's three packs of goddamn
seeds for a fucking price of one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just give away shit because I'm a
weird, I like being nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do they buy your gear right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, did you hit up anywhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no, I don't have it on any sites right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Mr. Matthew here, right here that I'm
circling with my mouse is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: taking care of that for me next week.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next round of stuff we'll be
carrying on the right side.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if people are looking forward to it,
just hold your horses and we'll get it up
[SPEAKER_03]: there soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as, as soon as we slowly can see,
uh, I love a pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and YZ the bond bonds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you the fucking red wine gas,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm shit you not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the weirdest thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red vine likes to come out in these
crosses just randomly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will find this red vine licorice
or like he said, like a cherry fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's a trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fucking trip, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, but I think, uh, that I love a pot has
probably grown a lot of my seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, yeah, I think he's grown a lot of
my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's a good, he's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have several fellows in here who have
grown a lot of my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the bond bond was a fucking great one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm, I'm trying to, uh, uh,
read up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I see somebody asking, what is
rainbow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fifth season, I'll go over it again,
because somebody, uh, did say some lies
[SPEAKER_01]: about what rainbow was, uh, my brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so rainbow started off with what I
would say in the story earlier from a
[SPEAKER_01]: friend of mine named smoke from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he called it chocolate time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the revs cherry tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the cross that I've made that
made me, you know, I, I, I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife would vouch for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost track of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: She, I went late in bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had to keep coming and checking on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to keep asking her how long it's
been.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was in, I was in a place man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in a fucking place that was
uncomfortable for like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I was younger back then, but I had
stopped doing LSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had stopped doing mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had stopped expanding my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now all of a sudden after years,
like my brain is going through some shit
[SPEAKER_01]: and it wasn't comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, smokes chocolate revs cherry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I took a male from that and I was
like, I told Matt, those, I love OGs and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, triangle has been one of my like go-to
OGs for breeding back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I hit a triangle with the mail and
then that's when I found the red vine and
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really work with those anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was done.
[SPEAKER_01]: The red vine was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking red vine was my jam.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember, I remember that era.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I thought OGKB came out and I
said, well, fuck man, that plants like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that duck foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was that plant, that weirdo plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took a male from the red vine,
which is the chocolate and the cherry plus
[SPEAKER_01]: the triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I take a male from that to the
OGKB.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the story with the first
fucking seed was what I ended up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not name that.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, uh, three year old did,
uh, she has the best names.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is now fucking 13 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: She'll be 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: She'll be 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, that little girl, I was on the
phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was you and me talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my friend, uh, my friend Ryan and
I were talking and I was telling him about
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I found this fucking plant and I,
I've never seen anything quite like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way it stacks, the way the resonance,
but it was that smell and that turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kept saying, OG, OG, OG,
OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get off the phone, you know,
and she looks at me, she goes,
[SPEAKER_01]: daddy, I know it's, you can name your
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's in there watching my little
ponies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: She's all rainbow S S O G.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the SS SS has no meaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally, it's not fucking Nazi
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not fucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a sunset Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not sour something or literally this
is a child's brain who named it rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause she loved rainbows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she heard me talk about OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where the SS came from,
but she said rainbow SS OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was all done.
Done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smarter than both of us combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go with her instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all like, because I was going to name
it all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put it on one label.
[SPEAKER_01]: The label would have been fucking all this
shit that went into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, now there's people, so many
different people trying to push different
[SPEAKER_03]: rainbows stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unicorns, rainbows and unicorns,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking out of control with the
rainbow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were the one that was super flaming
for doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now everyone's flaming with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's the fun thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I've said it very often.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a bet that I could name it like,
do this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The kid would name it these pony things
and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would have grown ass men talking
about my little ponies and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I fucking won that bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause look, there's my gay time unicorn
pops.
[SPEAKER_01]: How good did those look though?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those real?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was real.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like those strawberry ones,
but with chocolate, chocolate and fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: glitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I bet that's so fucking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unicorn blood and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get with the daytime for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that was one of our Australian
friends who sent me that picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, so right there, I got that peppery
white widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually was just telling Matt the other
day, I still have some of the original
[SPEAKER_01]: like back when the controversy split white
widow, black widow, blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_01]: blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those seeds are being done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have some of those originals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And SS is for boats, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barack Obama.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is for boats and real.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understood that, but I didn't think a
little kid like the SS man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think the three-year-old would
know what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always thought it was shoot stop in or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, somebody asked me that once.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I was being very clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, is that like a Nazi stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's none.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my string Fluttershy 88 might have
some.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to check fucking Fluttershy
or fucking Applejack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Applejack might have a couple of SSs on
her hindquarters.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few lightning bolts might happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking Christ, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see how gay my stuff is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all super pink and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really think I'm a Nazi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oddly enough, we were drawn to each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've actually been to a rest stop
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Starbucks together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we did, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't get much more romantic than that
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had lots of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember on the drive up,
how half of California was on fire and
[SPEAKER_03]: people were lighting the highway on fire
as we were driving up?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fucking insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were lighting it on fire as we were
driving.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we were driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had blowtorches, blowtorch guns,
and they were just catching the road on
[SPEAKER_01]: fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a weird one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember we went to some Mexican food
restaurant in Delano.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the best fucking beans I've ever
had in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beans and rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt so bad because I don't eat when I
travel because I don't have a colon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ordered beans and rice and I took a bite
and I cried.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking the greatest bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a Mexican food snob.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit was ... It was so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember wanting to drive back and get
more rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to just turn around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it in the ice chest and we'll have it
in the fucking hotel when we get there,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss ... Dude, I drove the 99 trying to
visualize it, but we were so dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew it was this little standee story
thingy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got off of the road and it was kind of
in the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was by Delano, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a little roundabout and it was a
dirt area and a little parking lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stayed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Petey had a piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: I needed to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you went inside and got fucking
rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, dude, I want to try beans and rice
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be a big boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went in and just asked the girl,
I said, will you do a bowl of beans and
[SPEAKER_01]: rice?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then a tortilla on the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, do you just want a bean and
rice burrito?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, no, no, no, listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you do a bowl of fucking beans and
rice with a tortilla on the side?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I get that burrito,
I'm going to eat that motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I just start dipping little bits of
tortilla, I'll be an anorexic fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: weirdo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, you better stop eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to shit your pants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, that was a car full of fucking
morons.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a live.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a live.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did do a live.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of my very first live feeds
ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a fucking live and I remember
people are asking me questions on why I
[SPEAKER_01]: used aloe or something when I was cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was always obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's free cloning gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, because I'm a cheap ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fucking works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of the questions that stick out
for some reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I had started doing live feeds a
week before that to build up to the
[SPEAKER_03]: Emerald Cup because I was going to be
bringing a bunch of seeds and I was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, we're going to be there,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then on the way there was probably my
second or third ever live stream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then now it just never stopped and they
couldn't get rid of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel so bad that so many people have
typed stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is something, I'm going to look
for five minutes right now, I promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's something you want me to
answer, type it in because I'll look right
[SPEAKER_01]: now because I feel bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are spending time writing this
stuff and I feel like an asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: SS is for super sexy and I'm all like,
look at all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I turn around and show them a little
fucking brown eye in the back door and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're all like, whoa, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so in the chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a werewolf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Britt was asking me that question the
other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was asking why guys have to white more
than once.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have fucking grabbers back there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have little grabbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Motherfuckers want to hang on.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to hang on for dear God damn
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if you've got mush butt,
then you got fucking no problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who shot JFK?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably several people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably several people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it seems like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, I don't know though because I have
been hearing, I have been hearing that
[SPEAKER_01]: JFK's alive and doing well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying, I'm just, fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sending out a railing out coke right now
as we speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there Hayes or Sativa varieties you
found you really liked?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the, oh God, what was the
Brothers Hayes that was coming down Santa
[SPEAKER_01]: Cruz?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hayes Brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hayes Brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was the Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I cannot smoke it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just fucking wrecks me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still can smoke Blue Dream though and
Blue Dream has some Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has Hayes in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was coming out of the same area that
the Hayes Brothers were working in and
[SPEAKER_01]: they call it Santa Cruz Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa Cruz Hayes had the Hayes Brothers
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not saying that that's the Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for Blue Dream to be so fucking
special, I would bet a dollar that it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's definitely some Hayes in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was Super Silver Hayes,
I believe by a Kentucky, I can't remember
[SPEAKER_03]: the name of the company that originally
made the Super Silver Hayes DJ shorts at
[SPEAKER_03]: Blueberry Cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was used, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I still like that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that mixture because I can smoke
Blue Dream and not get the jitters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's because of the blueberry in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just anti-anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love blueberry by itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to smoke old blueberry that tastes
like blueberry and it doesn't get you
[SPEAKER_01]: super high.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I like growing Calio too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably 9% THC in that fucking
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love smoking the shit out of it because
I can smoke a whole joint and go,
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to go do shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking spaz attack in the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude, it's fucking terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have you grown out Mom Gooey or Pure
Gooey?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you compare it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Different than Af Gooey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember that one from Gooey
Breeder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not super up to speed on Gooey
Breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what he did and stuff, but I had
not got around to growing a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never grown any of it either myself,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a lot of friends that liked the
Gooey Breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a Gooey clone, but I'd never grown
any myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, RKS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So literally, my first memory in life
ever, my first memory in life,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on a boat fishing with my uncle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was still in baby diaper stuff and it
was dark and the skunks were just spraying
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a kid, that's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all they had.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the same memories I had with my
dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to this day, people don't understand
it, but if I smell a skunk that has
[SPEAKER_03]: sprayed an area and it's a few miles away,
I equate that with weed or burning weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I like the smell of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a matter of fact, I had a homie send me
some skunk tincture here today and I
[SPEAKER_03]: opened it in the house and bring it back
and I was like, it should smell good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, my dad had a pet skunk when he was a
kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took the bag out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That motherfucker grew its back back and
sprayed him in his fucking face.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see another one of my friends right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taylor Graham.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taylor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow techniques, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you and I have had that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the first day or two, I like to get
a large amount of moisture out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, it's so hard for me to say this
because people might take it wrong and
[SPEAKER_01]: say, oh, it's going to be weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I leave all my leaves on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big water leaves I take off.
[SPEAKER_01]: All bud leaves stay on, everything like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, with saying that,
it's holding a lot of moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get a lot of air movement in the
room, but not on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just a lot of air movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have a lot of air coming out
and getting clean and coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're constantly flipping the humidity
around and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those first few days are really,
really important because if you let it
[SPEAKER_01]: stay wet too long, you're going to lose
some of that crispness.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, you're going to lose some
of that crispness to the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get a quicker dry at the beginning
and then I slow that motherfucker down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I pick it back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's so weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do this classic keep it one
percentage across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally am in and out of my dry rooms,
checking them multiple times a day,
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will raise humidity, lower humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, I am probably one of the worst
people to learn to grow from because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: all in my brain that I'm constantly
fucking doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when I'm feeding plants, I go and
check the plants and I go, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is where I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like when I leave and PD has to
come and fucking help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God, everything gets ruined.
[SPEAKER_01]: I now do not go and eat like vacations or
anything while I'm growing unless I can
[SPEAKER_01]: fill my reservoirs and be back before
they're empty and he just waters and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But be anal about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Constantly check them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill your buds, put your hands on it,
smell them, see where it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that crispness.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how your buds dry and have to keep
some of the moisture content, but it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: like you don't get black ash or anything
crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sticky still.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's some of the best weed I've ever
smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Him and piss weed are my two tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fernando, the turps on rainbow,
I get asked a lot, Matt, what do you,
[SPEAKER_01]: the turps on rainbow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a piney funky.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can compare the turps on the rainbow
clone, the actual rainbow clone to a very
[SPEAKER_03]: turpy OG with some doughy notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost like sourdough bread with no gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a fucking sourdough starter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the other one, my favorite cut is the
chocolate one and that was Brent's
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one she loved and I liked it
because it had more of an anti-anxiety
[SPEAKER_03]: high, kind of like blueberry does for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt will have seeds next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what I'm going to do you guys on
this release is the FIMS and the reason
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do the FIMS is I've grown
hundreds of them and I am really proud of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really kicking out a lot of really
nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rainbow cyst made a lot of nice
crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I got a cramp in my fucking leg from
reading all those numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking Scarecrow, you already won.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scarecrow's already won the first one,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Scarecrow's already won one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flowering times on the chocolate
cherry tie, that was what was funny is the
[SPEAKER_01]: rev had got, that's why I questioned the
cherry on the cherry tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the rev had got it under 70
fucking days, like no shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: His whole goal was to shorten it and the
rev went hard on that project.
[SPEAKER_01]: That chocolate cherry though, that made me
go crazy legs, Rowdy, I grew it outdoors
[SPEAKER_01]: into November and it was, I think,
18 feet tall or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was as high as the fucking barn and the
barn was two stories and I should have
[SPEAKER_01]: never have smoked that marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have smoked that marijuana,
I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you, you got me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it did put me, I do have some Blue
Dream crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some TK crosses with the,
they're gonna be Femmes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be Blue Dream by Rainbow Sys,
TK by Rainbow Sys.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is the SD by Rainbow Sys.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is actually the, I know this one's
gonna, actually bred so well, the London
[SPEAKER_01]: Pound Cake 75.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one bred pretty well?
[SPEAKER_01]: It fucking bred really well with rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: All it did was lint's flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite OG is called, I've called it
the San Diego cut or the San Diego OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my favorite OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know exactly what it is and
like they said, Alex said triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that San Diego and triangle are
the same fucking plant that were in two
[SPEAKER_01]: different people's growths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I acquired both of those cuts but had
been on two different paths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like person A kept really good care of
their cut and person B might not have
[SPEAKER_01]: taken as good care of his cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one time that that plant had a
little regression changed the plant just a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So triangle San Diego, fuck man.
[SPEAKER_01]: On a deserted island, I could only have
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be a rough, that'd be a rough fucking
go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're equals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't pick a few just to take on desert
island.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's several I wanna bring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm too much of a flavor person and smells
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'll have like 14, 15 jars when I
grow that I keep in them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I prefer to smell 14 different flowers
and then go through and pick it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's the whole breaking it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still break up my fucking weed with my
fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I roll my joints and I still use
little papers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to be able to feel how it's
breaking up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like every last bit of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how it's dried and yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get that from a grinder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's cool about the San Diego
cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It breaks up this, you get this tiny
little stem at the end and it's this
[SPEAKER_01]: sticky leaves of funk, nasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was shucking some of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish she was in here, but she's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was shucking some of those seeds the
other night.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend who is in here actually,
I'm not gonna say who you are,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he's in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows who he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was shucking seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told him the story too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wife came in pissed that one of the
dogs had pissed all over the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had just pissed everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's all, there's piss in the fucking
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she looks at me, she goes,
it's the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how pissy some of these oats are.
[SPEAKER_01]: OGs can be the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can, this cut to my wife smells
like piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it doesn't, like at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's that, that funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That ammonia shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't find 296, but I did find 297.
[SPEAKER_01]: You found 297?
[SPEAKER_03]: I found 297 in all this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's someone that probably wants to
grow your shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love pot also had the 279.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was when I was all like,
Oh my God, somebody has it flipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The closest one right before that is 293.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 297 is to get on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know me, send me the fucking message
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the routine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said it so much earlier than everyone
else do.

[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck is that fucking creepy shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I do.

[SPEAKER_03]: settled.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do it more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, um, I would, I love doing this
kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually haven't been nervous in a long
time with you and I were first talking
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that countdown got 28, 20,
I was all like, what are these feelings?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this shit in my chest?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was all instantly like, all right,
it's, it's go time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to start making fucking words
and start making words and smiling like
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking say a bunch of weird shit about
weird stuff, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't even scratch the surface though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know story time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we have been an hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much more to cover, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we have a lot to, uh, and now that I
know he can get online, like a,
[SPEAKER_03]: like a big boy and get on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be, I'll, I'll be coming on more
often, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do have, uh, NL five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crosses as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, um, I don't have NL five, uh,
Hayes, um, process, but I have Hayes
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses with some NL five seeds that,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have my brother's NL five.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't create NL five, you know,
beings, but I have the cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the cut that he possesses and I've
worked with before we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a quick one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did your brother create purple oracle?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a question everybody wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can't, I love, my brother hates me
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, he's, so I want to, I'm going to,
I'm going to say it's story just for two
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I created rainbow and,
uh, I started growing it, uh, my brother
[SPEAKER_01]: called me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, I never call.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never call.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would text.
[SPEAKER_01]: He called me and asked me.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, Hey, give me rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'll work with it and we can release
the seeds as a brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had already literally sit fucking bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: All my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had already worked these lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I so deep into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wanted basically the finished
product and to sell it and say like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a brother project.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wasn't interested in you starting your
own company.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think which was the, he wasn't
interested in you doing it yourself or you
[SPEAKER_03]: making the money.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was interested in you giving the work
to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't, I wasn't interested in
selling fucking seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You literally convinced me to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're the person who encouraged me
who like, we're all like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys, this guy fucking knows like
things are and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, he grows really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I'm going to make him sell you
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make him put his shit on the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to find like, make him put it on
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make them put it on the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I fucking put it on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, I can't appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't appreciate the amount of friends
that I've met now and the conversations
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I don't post on there, but I still
do come and have conversations with so
[SPEAKER_01]: many of you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, and I really do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's some nights when I feel like
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of you guys will send me a
message.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like, we start conversing and some
of us have had conversations for fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: hours, you know, just by just chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is where it started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, um, they came to my daughter's
birthday and were mad at me for,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, selling them through to Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, one of the auctions that we
did got a few of the auctions that we did
[SPEAKER_01]: got really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can not control what people,
uh, I was fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was freaking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was telling Matt, like that's too much
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to send this person all of my seeds
because they're spending this much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally, they won like a pack of seeds
in the auction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent them like four packs because I was
like, that's too much fucking money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they, that happened like 10
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we did like 10 auctions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was expecting like three, $400.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there was some of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like two and $3,000 fucking
dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I freaked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was on no, like it's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and they, that really got them mad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one of, uh, one of you guys who
were my friends sent me some screenshots
[SPEAKER_01]: of some pretty terrible stuff that was
said about me, uh, behind my back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so at that point I was on like,
you know what, if you don't like,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you don't want to be like my brother,
like, let's just not be like brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I, I have never spoke on this for
fucking years, for years that I've had
[SPEAKER_01]: this and I've no, I've been ran down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I know I've been ran down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I know I've had shit talked about me
and lie said about me and bullshit like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you have questions about me or
something, just come and ask me,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll fucking, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's very much an open book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I am just asking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to fucking lie to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, when people ask me about after
we, I'm all like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only time I ever had a bitch fucking
flowered and veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I couldn't grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like I sucked it growing after we.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's, I wanted to give that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much more to it, but that's
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll say, unless somebody wants,
you know, to know more or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we haven't spoken in a few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a few years.
[SPEAKER_03]: We both push on the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, and like, I always said, like I said to
you, even at the beginning, like me and
[SPEAKER_03]: your brother weren't necessarily cool,
but we were always cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had no reason to like not like him
and I was always cool to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always thought, well, he had made
good shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought he made good shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was no reason to make anything
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Illuminati telling us to wrap
the motherfucking show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said too much, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said too many fucking words.
