[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeder Cynicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_03]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_03]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host, Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie,
[SPEAKER_03]: Natsodon, Breeder and Grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_03]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you kind of enlighten us a little bit
on Mark Emory, both of you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just give us a quick take from a Canadian
perspective on Mark Emory, because we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have a really clear one,
at least from my era and point of view in
[SPEAKER_03]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one thing I'm not sure about was
Mark Emory involved in cannabis before the
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp nation constitutional challenge?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the constitutional challenge,
he started hemp BC by that time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you have to remember Mark's from this
town, from my town.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a bookstore here called City
Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: He scammed those people also when it came
to selling it, but Mark, I call him the
[SPEAKER_02]: dark enemy for a reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's very suiting, it ironically
matches his name, but he is somebody that,
[SPEAKER_02]: in his own words, said he was against
legalizing the realization of cannabis due
[SPEAKER_02]: to the amount of money that he was making
from selling seeds illegally.
[SPEAKER_02]: He proved this after hemp nation was
busted for the second time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first time was Great Canadian
Emporium, second time was hemp nation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris was not allowed to sell
paraphernalia after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he decided that he reached out to Mark,
who had hemp BC and said, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: listen, do you want to buy all the
inventory from hemp nation because we need
[SPEAKER_02]: to raise the money for the constitutional
challenge?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he agreed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, yeah, send me everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was like pulling teeth to get
paid from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the very end of it, I mean,
it wasn't a shitload of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it was only 10, 20 grand or
something like that in inventory.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're fighting the government to
legalize cannabis, every penny counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Chris kept getting the, you know,
oh, talk to my accountant, talk to my
[SPEAKER_02]: accountant.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this time, it was in around this time,
friends of mine through Red from Legends,
[SPEAKER_02]: a mutual friend worked for Mark basically
almost as like manager area of sales for
[SPEAKER_02]: his direct seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was doing something like 20,
40, $60,000 a week in cannabis sales and
[SPEAKER_02]: seed sales.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it was all said and done with
hemp nation, Chris claimed bankruptcy with
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark Emory still owing him money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was only maybe a thousand or two
thousand dollars at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it kind of just showed what the term
douchebag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, about my use of the word
douchebag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to start saving it for like the
appropriate people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And dark enemy is I feel the biggest
douchebag in our industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: He claims that he donated all this money
and stuff like that, but he didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would, you know, he did a interview and
I think it was on like CBC or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jody and him were together for less
than a year, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's sitting there having her like
clip his toenails on camera while he's
[SPEAKER_02]: being interviewed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it was my mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got up and he was butt naked or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, what kind of fucking
douchebag?
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the word douchebag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's or allows his girlfriend who was
barely out of being a teenager at the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is fucking toenails on national TV?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yes, my girlfriend and my my wife,
sure, she would probably if I asked her
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I wouldn't ask her never in a
fucking lifetime asked her to do it on
[SPEAKER_02]: camera to show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a big thing that came out like
he he was just very inappropriate with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say I don't know of any charges
that were laid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there should have been.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know he did run from political office
here in London and he was dating somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: that we knew he was dating this guy's
ex-wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this guy had, I think, two kids,
two boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mark, his speeches kept saying,
I'm a family man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about family.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, here's my wife and my kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, dude, you can't call my
kids your kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it ended up that Mark, I believe,
was giving a speech or something down at
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the parks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this guy walked out of the crowd,
walked up and punched him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you get it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hallelujah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like basically punch Mark in the
fucking head, said, stop fucking claiming
[SPEAKER_02]: my kids as you is because, you know,
he's he was he's a showboater.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, is he has he's done
certain things.
[SPEAKER_02]: He used to do something here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He fought for for stores to be open on
Sunday before when it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kudos for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had some of his staff or something
follow minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy is doing the parking police,
whatever, and walking around with nickels
[SPEAKER_02]: or quarters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if he saw an expired meter,
he'd drop a quarter or nickel in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kudos for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, Mark, Mark is like the
Donald Trump of the fucking cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he talks the talk, but he's burned so
many fucking bridges.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is, I got into yelling matches
on on the phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because he was like, why the fuck are
you bashing me?
[SPEAKER_02]: I kicked him out of my store when he came
into town.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can go to high times.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy, my competition to his horn as
much as he wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And furthermore, when I opened Organic
Traveler, I took over all of Hemp Nation's
[SPEAKER_02]: gear, everything down from the display
cases, including the computers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on his computers, I had access to all
the files and all the outstanding debts
[SPEAKER_02]: that Mark owed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was bad melting him and trying to be
loud enough that he wouldn't hear me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously he did because he called me
up one day on speakerphone with other
[SPEAKER_02]: people in the background and try to bitch
me, like try to make a scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark, I got the fucking computers here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you what date you made payments
and what date and how much you owed at the
[SPEAKER_02]: very end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me he's like, Pete, it was only
fucking thousand bucks, couple thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still owe it dollars, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were trying to fucking change the laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris went to fucking jail for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah went to jail for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy's out there making tens,
if not hundreds of thousands of dollars a
[SPEAKER_02]: month.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's going to stick some fucking guy
that's trying to fight the marijuana laws
[SPEAKER_02]: so that he can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this comes through word of mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the people that tell me this kind of
thing, I give 10 times a thousand times
[SPEAKER_02]: more credit than I give Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, you know, he'll admit that
often.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Move to the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm all for spreading the seed
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use that fucking, you know, and what got
me also was back then I was actually
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do air quotes because it's not I was
just breeding for seed to get the seed out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we're going back to the mid 90s
kind of thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would send Mark seeds and this when he
was first started his seed business and we
[SPEAKER_02]: would tell him that whatever the buck a
seed or a couple bucks a seed or something
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'd be honest, like, listen,
like I told you in the last interview,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would buy seeds from Sensi or Greenhouse
or something and then do a breeding just
[SPEAKER_02]: using those genetics and saying,
hey, listen, this is this is our Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: We bought the Northern Lights five.
[SPEAKER_02]: We bought the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made our own seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're selling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we would say, oh, we like to we wanted
to blend it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did like a Northern Lights chemo,
which was something that we really liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would sell Mark the seeds and he
would change the names or remove certain
[SPEAKER_02]: things like he would just call the
Northern Lights chemo, just chemo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it sells better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was dishonest when he when it came
to selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't he wasn't selling it as,
you know, Sensi seeds, fucking Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just saying, hey, this is pure
Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it wasn't pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fucking bred by me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Hemp Nation crew and or in a Hemp
Nation garden or my garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were just doing it to spread the
Johnny Appleseed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to sell the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we were selling, I think it was
10 seeds for 25 bucks or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: 250 a seed to get it out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, people that, again,
I even said in the last interview,
[SPEAKER_02]: people that focus on the money in this
industry are in the industry, not the
[SPEAKER_02]: movement and people that claim to be in
the movement like Mark does, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he he was hiding behind Jodi till the
very end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know what the fuck is wrong
with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not going to get into any personal
shit because there's some shit he's done
[SPEAKER_02]: to friends of mine personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you if you Google Mark Emory
and you look for stuff, it's like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when he got out west,
I think it got worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like it's all about ego.
[SPEAKER_02]: He all he and my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were out in Vancouver,
we wouldn't step foot in the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, like on that strip, like like we
wouldn't like we didn't even want to go
[SPEAKER_00]: into his establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's how much we disliked him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just knew like he was a piece of shit
like fuck him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, he's it's about self-promotion with
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing to do with the movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not one of us with anything,
but fucking you know, he went to I think
[SPEAKER_02]: was Thailand before he went out west,
you know, or maybe it was during because
[SPEAKER_02]: he went out there and like dropped a bunch
of money on some locals that, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just bought this property.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has fucking X amount of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a fucking house when I come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when he came back, he went back
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The land was just overgrown, nothing built
and his money was gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would honestly wish that there wasn't
so many, you know, he comes back to this
[SPEAKER_02]: town and he thinks he's fucking he ran for
political office last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was hilarious because every time I
drove by him, I would call him a fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: douchebag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not liked around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got very little votes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the funny thing is, is I was either
driving my Volkswagen bus and my
[SPEAKER_02]: Volkswagen, Karma gear or my truck or my
Mini Cooper or my Jeep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was always driving something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's probably thought the whole fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope other people join me, but he's
fucking yelling at him left, right and
[SPEAKER_02]: center because he doesn't fucking live
here while he might live here now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he moved back here for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe he would go back,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I like when I lived there,
I didn't know one person that had anything
[SPEAKER_00]: to say but negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he didn't choose to leave London,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: He had to leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: He ended up he ended up in he started he
ended up fucking a fireman's wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought for some reason,
I thought he was fairly high up in the
[SPEAKER_02]: fire department.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if he's a chief or or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But rumor has it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they walked in to his fucking
bookstore and said there's a lot of paper
[SPEAKER_02]: in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This probably place would probably go up
pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes we hit red lights or
something along that line was set.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, could have been folklore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could have been anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because, you know, I knew what the
type of person I know the type of person
[SPEAKER_02]: he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: See that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it sucks to see people like
that get all the attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives us people out there,
especially as a Canadian, like to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: Prince of Oz.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that was especially like in B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kept going in B.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, let's let's get to
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the one thing that was resounding,
the resounding criticism from the last
[SPEAKER_03]: episode was that there were one or two
really loud B.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: growers that that that they were
misrepresented.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you can you explain it better than me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I before like when before we did the first
one, before we even recorded the first one
[SPEAKER_00]: in our little homie chat, I said there's
going to be some B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: people pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have I have a specific question in
mind, but I didn't even ask that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still got upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I actually went back and listened and
I know what he what the one guy at least
[SPEAKER_00]: was upset about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it was that people beat said it
all started here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a comment about,
of course, there's there's good growers in
[SPEAKER_00]: B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all from Ontario.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was like, this is like that,
you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but you and I have a very specific
viewpoint, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm back where I come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I grew up in London.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew up around like I like there is
like commercial what my friends called
[SPEAKER_00]: biker weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was just the commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once once you found like that,
like that downtown family, which was not
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to find, you know, you look you got
great pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you were getting it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like so me and my friends,
like, you know, we went on tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were like, fuck this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going on dead tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just wanted to like we wanted to
see the shows because we we were heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also wanted to see fucking pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was like the two were just
as equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did tour for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: That led us to the West Coast of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we we we saw that area and like we
were kind of like blown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, number one, the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could not fucking believe people were
paying what they were paying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that was just mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was comparable to back home to
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we got to the West Coast,
it's like same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like the only like the only thing
about the West Coast is we saw new stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that like names we'd never heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, there was people breeding
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was all this weird new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first time I saw like white
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it looked like mold in somebody's
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're like, no, that's you know,
that's fucking, you know, resident.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I lived in Arcata for
a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I lived in Arcata for a good stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I was there for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of saw and experienced what was
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really good weed like back
home, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like for me, it was like what we
had back home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got back home and like I went
into Pete's shop to like chat him up
[SPEAKER_00]: because back home, there's not too many
people that you could talk about that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and they understand what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, what it was taking
me out to Vancouver with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pete's response was like you were just
like disappointed, super disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were like, everybody goes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: West and they think the weed is so much
better there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not it's not, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think and like I said, I stand by
what I said before about all the good
[SPEAKER_02]: growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would say all but I can't say all
right, because we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say a large percentage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you two examples because a large
percentage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got hired after a stint in Switzerland
by a one of the larger brokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Vancouver area and like red,
he was named after a different color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just say blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and I think he's Ontario, too,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so they they dropped me into this
middle of but fuck nowhere between Jasper
[SPEAKER_02]: and Kamloops along I think it's Highway
five and built a huge greenhouse in the
[SPEAKER_02]: middle of the bush off grid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lived in a little log cabin off grid or
they already had three hundred three
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred bales of pro mix hiked into a bush
and big, huge outdoor beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, fucking right now,
I'm in the middle of fucking nowhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm finally going to meet some of these,
you know, grassroot B.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: growers that I fucking heard about,
read about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't meet fucking one person from B.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single person I met was from Ontario
or I'd say 80 percent from Ontario.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rest were kind of mixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go out to to Vancouver and the island and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask ask anybody where you're from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from B.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where were you born?
[SPEAKER_02]: What part?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was born in Etobicoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved here six months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, you're not from fucking B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 90s, it was very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most people that are from B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: were born in the fucking 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it just wasn't populated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't populated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The population was tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like what I was told, actually,
I'm not sure if it's totally true,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think it's believable was like in
the 80s, they were offering offering
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulus sort of situations for people to
move to B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was so underpopulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were even like doing that to
like, you know, lower income people like,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll give you money and we'll give you a
free trip to go to, you know, the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: Vancouver area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it just wasn't populated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the 90s, the great majority was not
from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just that's it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cannabis moved out there again,
like why everybody moved out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think, well, you know, it's
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more climatized and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the power to them, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but again, the genetics and the
techniques and the and the information in
[SPEAKER_02]: their heads come from Ontario.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a breeder out on the
island.
[SPEAKER_02]: He thinks he's a pretty great gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, besides, you know, but he's not
from fucking B.C., you know, he's from
[SPEAKER_02]: he's from this fucking town.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, well, like recently,
maybe dark enemies from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris Clay, Chris Clay's from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I don't know about,
you know, some of the other growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's phenomenal growers everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: B.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely has.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're seeing a lot of podcasts now,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this, where a lot of people are
speaking out and like C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ray, not from B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scabby, not from B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jay, not from B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every single person that that has
spoken out about B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: is not from B.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we've heard what was moved
out to B.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I got I got bit by the bug also,
like everybody and just some beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking people out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is with a lot stronger there
because the laws were a lot more forgiving
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, when it when push comes to
shove, yes, the people like, OK,
[SPEAKER_02]: where are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: From if they say B.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: ask them where they're born, because,
you know, it's not like they I'm surprised
[SPEAKER_02]: they got fucking maternity wards in
fucking Vancouver because nobody's from
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's some there's some right like
like like less than an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was off the plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were smoking Texas at a time warp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like there was a whole bunch of
Americans there like like our whole like
[SPEAKER_00]: deadhead crew that was in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were strong supporters of the
island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic, outdoor, you know, like that was
good shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be a good story for Redd,
too, if you ever want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of cool people in B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of good growers in B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if somebody is like insulted at the
fact that like B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: is in everything, maybe you're not growing
great weed if you're that insecure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, I can throw like
obviously like Mendo Mendo has some
[SPEAKER_01]: similarities and humble to because I'm
like, you know, you start talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, well, where were you born?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I mean, I'm a transplant out
here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, I ended up getting here a lot
earlier, you know, like than most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've lived out here a long time,
but I'm not from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when you look at the map of
Canada, almost all Canadians are from
[SPEAKER_01]: where you guys are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, again, the large population
southwestern Ontario and like I was saying
[SPEAKER_02]: before, in the last podcast where because
of how we're situated, the Great Lakes and
[SPEAKER_02]: Glacier runoff, we have some of the best
soil in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people don't probably realize this
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada is a huge place.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like most people look at it like I
think it's like 80, 90 percent of the
[SPEAKER_02]: people in Canada live within 100
kilometers of the border or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even even that, I was I was kind of like,
well, because like Matt thought when we
[SPEAKER_00]: said London, we're talking about B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: like his geography is like way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I was trying to explain to like
my American friends that like we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: just say Ontario, we can't just say B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's too huge like B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just saying even the coastal area,
you have all these independent islands
[SPEAKER_00]: that are like a place in themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have like the the Vancouver
Island, which could be split up in
[SPEAKER_00]: sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have the Kootenays, which is like
fucking 12 hours down the road that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just totally different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you say B.C., like I'm sure the
Coots had much better quality because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Vancouver area and the coastal
area was so big, it was so commercial that
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just flooded with commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was so fucking flooded with
commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hard to find good weed because
there was so much commercial to get rid
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like nobody had time to even think
about quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like because a lot of the
organized growers, organized crime
[SPEAKER_02]: growers, that's where they were going to
be around.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you get into like the Kootenays
Nelson area, you know, when you get into
[SPEAKER_02]: the kind family mentality that still grow
for the love of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, the movement people,
not the industry people.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in the industry, you are going
to be in probably Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be someplace west of Hope
and south of Whistler kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as soon as you get on to the
island, same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get more of the kind
family vibe and mentality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent some time out in Nelson and
Winlaw, that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nelson is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were just like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: They grew phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I named my dog a Kootenay string.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called Kootenay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, our friend, I got to mention
because he passed away, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of years ago, maybe Cormie's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He passed away not long ago, but he was
like a lot of our friends are there,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the people we grew up are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of our friends went to the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say like of that, of like,
like my age people that were brought up
[SPEAKER_00]: there, like 90% went to the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say like the drum circles I used
to have at Organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to have all like the hippies that
would, hippie kids I call them,
[SPEAKER_02]: like kids who were your age, maybe even a
little bit younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to all come to Organic Travel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did drum circles on Sundays or Sundays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say 90% of them ended out in the
Nelson area and probably a good portion of
[SPEAKER_02]: them fucking played in Wasabi kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they were all... Well, but that's the
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was, in London, they were
called Kangaroo, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This band, they were like a little fun
damn band called Kangaroo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like they all, like when they got old
enough to go to college, they went there
[SPEAKER_00]: and like everybody went there with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you had, shit on my dipstick,
what are they called?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jimmy's band back here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yaki Mystic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yaki Mystic, Kangaroo and those guys,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Jimmy went with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jimmy was with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cause when they all got there,
they joined up with Wasabi Collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Jimmy was in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, that's what I was trying to get
at about, you know, the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know, I invite anybody who wants
to challenge me on fucking, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: East coast, West coast, where all the
growers come.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, you think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a pissing contest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not a pissing contest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it shouldn't be, but it is for some,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that kind of brings me into my next
thing, because when I talk about,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Legend Seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And SOL, they're from this area,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're old friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I listened back on the last podcast
and I use the word, the term we a lot when
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk about these guys, because they're
friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it came to their breeding and
stuff like that, Legends and SOL,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just, I wasn't part of their company
or part of their group.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was friends with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might've, you know, did whatever they
wanted me to do kind of thing as helping
[SPEAKER_02]: out a friend, but I wasn't ever,
when I say we, I don't mean I helped breed
[SPEAKER_02]: anything with these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a friend circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a career.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it brought me to another point where
in my book, there's a typo, which I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: surprised Steve hasn't come and fucking
try to firebomb my house yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we were talking about the Fast
Sphere, which we spoke about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that though, the last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said this already.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I'm using this part.
[SPEAKER_02]: This part is on the very last paragraph of
the one chapter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, it was supposed to say,
I grew an award-winning strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it said, I bred an award-winning
strain.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but it taught all through the whole
chapter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just talks about me being a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm being a grower there and working for
Mr. Hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I answered to Steve,
it was his program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but the very last thing was just,
it was a typo and Red brought it up and I
[SPEAKER_02]: was like, oh fuck man, Steve's going to
kill me because he thinks I'm trying to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, steal his fucking limelight,
even though he stole my metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, I think that's a common thing in
cannabis actually, because of how in the
[SPEAKER_01]: shadows and clandestine is, I do the same
thing, dude, where some of the stories I
[SPEAKER_01]: tell where it's we, it's like,
there's people that are known and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those people that are unknown wish
to remain unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're trying to tell history and
tell a story, but you have to sort of edit
[SPEAKER_01]: it to some degree because what you're
giving is accurate information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the flip side of that is that
there's people that want to be cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want to aggregate all the fame to
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even if it might've been a
collective of friends all doing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to tell the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was them alone in their basement
working for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they came out with all this and
no one else has shit to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you know personally that there was
like seven other dudes, and it was this
[SPEAKER_01]: loose collective of friends that were all
involved and this breeding happened at
[SPEAKER_01]: this house then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this accident happened over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be kind of weird to tell
stories that way because a lot of money is
[SPEAKER_01]: made on, you know, every breeder in Mike's
except for maybe Neville, but most
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders are like, well, no, Neville was
very clear about, I got this from this
[SPEAKER_01]: person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that from that person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did this and this almost all breeders
after him were like, like this never
[SPEAKER_01]: existed before I carefully crafted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no one else has had any of these
genetics ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like fucking land race kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like they just obscure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to, I'm going to break in cause
like not to interrupt the flow,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I didn't get to actually ask my
question when we were talking about the BC
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to ask this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to add, but it kind of is
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's a dishonesty thing or like an
illusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thing, I guess you would say, but like
that conversation, going back to that
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation when you were disappointed,
you mentioned something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time you mentioned it,
I kind of thought you were crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I didn't, like, I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When somebody tells you something you
don't know, you're kind of like what,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you said something about high times
and hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that magazine or the store,
the magazine that like BC was only,
[SPEAKER_00]: got really popular because high times was
hyping them to kind of draw attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember this conversation?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what I, what I remember,
which this could be totally false was that
[SPEAKER_00]: you were like, BC was like hyping up the
big bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause at the time, like BC was really
blowing up as like, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you were like, the magazine was kind
of like trying to draw attention from the
[SPEAKER_00]: U S and DA attention to, to BC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember that conversation,
but I mean, part of that sounded a little
[SPEAKER_02]: familiar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what high times is trying to pimp
was because California was such a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: market for cannabis counterculture,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause high times isn't a cannabis
magazine, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a counterculture magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why it has so much music.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has so much cannabis is only a section
of it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And for a few years they got rid of it,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have cannabis for a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when they started grow America
for, for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think because the term BC bud,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything Canada was BC bud, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think they were pimping that as well
as because of the climate, you could have
[SPEAKER_02]: larger outdoor grows and we could in
Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wouldn't go into Quebec.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you could also have fairly large
outgrows because of the language barrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think for high times, I wouldn't say
I know for a fact, but pretty damn sure
[SPEAKER_02]: with my interaction with them,
that they were pushing the BC bud because
[SPEAKER_02]: of its popularity in California,
because your top dollar, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: anything from your tuna cans, fucking
anything that was the BC bud got the top
[SPEAKER_02]: dollar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I mean, there's a name that we
mentioned in our last talk and he was a
[SPEAKER_02]: broker.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's still in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's, I think he's a fucking great guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows a, he knows a lot of history of
this, of this movement from the West
[SPEAKER_02]: coast, but he was a broker and he used to
sell, be able to sell a certain type of
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, it was a pink something,
but he was selling for $2,900 a pound to
[SPEAKER_02]: LA because it was, that's nothing though.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were selling 32 for out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I realized that, but this is outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: What year is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was Canadian or US.
[SPEAKER_02]: What year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it would have been the beaster
era.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say like late nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, you know, it was so, it was a
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was called soda.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cream soda.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we grew that out in Switzerland
actually.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, the guy that's growing it is a,
I'm going to use the word douchebag again,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I was trying not to use,
but this guy's a fucking douchebag.
[SPEAKER_02]: He ran the farm that I was, uh,
hired to work on in, uh, in the interior
[SPEAKER_02]: and, um, his name is Jay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know his last name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I knew his last name.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd say it here too.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the cream soda?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the first time I ever saw that really
unique, uh, plant, uh, it had really
[SPEAKER_02]: bright, uh, pink stigmas in it where,
um, it wasn't a huge producer,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it, it grew kind of like a really
short, kind of like the print pink freeze
[SPEAKER_02]: land, which I wouldn't be surprised if it
might've, you know, again, traveled West,
[SPEAKER_02]: which a lot of genetics did back in the
day, as we've talked about before,
[SPEAKER_02]: that was just like, you know, it wasn't a
very strong structured plant, but it just
[SPEAKER_02]: grew all these golf balls that would just
would, I mean, maybe a little bit easier
[SPEAKER_02]: to trim, but just look beautiful,
rock hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would give you the, the BC bag of
marbles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of what I call a lot of the,
you know, any pot that comes across my
[SPEAKER_02]: desk nowadays, I can basically look at it
and tell you where it comes from by bag
[SPEAKER_02]: appeal because you know, BC had the
tendency for a while there of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not trimming the pot, but shaping it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every dog looked like a fucking marble,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but I mean, it's back when they
were making tons of extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were trimming off a lot of the
stuff because they knew they were going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to use it kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you got the bag of marbles,
the BC bag of marbles that, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: was just kind of a look.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that the cream soda was,
um, uh, was a strain that was kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: For their outdoor to look like indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why bubble was able to fuck in,
you know, for ridiculous amounts of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a strain out here called the
West coast dog like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just outdoor for indoor type shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and where I live in Mendo,
it's like, that's been the game forever of
[SPEAKER_01]: brokers being like, well, this outdoor
passes light depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this light depth look good enough to
pass as indoor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because where there was unedited
educated areas of the country or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were like, can I, can I put this into
a different bracket?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I buy this for what it is,
but claim it's the next grade up?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and that's the, that's the
industry envelope in the movement,
[SPEAKER_02]: the movement, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's going to be people like
myself that say, Hey, listen, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like indoor, you know,
but fuck, I, I'm going to be honest with
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to be dishonest
afterwards, because of that, that's up to
[SPEAKER_02]: you, but I'm probably going to charge you
fucking more money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to pay a fucking tax on
something that looks spectacular.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a fuck if it's indoor or
outdoor or fucking greenhouse or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, small crop, large crop,
you know, hand trim machine trim,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like there's, there's so many
variables at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it fucking looks good, smells good and
fucking kicks you in the nuts,
[SPEAKER_02]: then what the fuck, who cares how it's
grown?
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, I think like, what do we,
what do we do when we grow indoor?
[SPEAKER_02]: All we're trying to do is mimic outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to mimic mother nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother nature has the fucking,
the formula down where now we're able to,
[SPEAKER_02]: with technology and so on, we're allowed,
we can better mother nature, but for the
[SPEAKER_02]: longest time, we were just trying to
reproduce outside, inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think we can do everything better
than nature indoor, except for the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, of course you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the sun is, the sun still by far
is the best light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've done all kinds of spectrum
experiments and all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, to some degree it's
interesting too, cause like all,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost all of the award winning hash made
in California is all made with the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they don't use indoor grown
stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor might get, you know, humans are so
visual that indoor might look prettier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I, I also wanted to make a comment
when you guys were talking about Ontario,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just different areas,
there could be a lot just for the simple
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that BC bud rhymes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ontario Nug doesn't really like,
what do you, what do you call Ontario
[SPEAKER_01]: weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so, you know, I live in Mendocino
County or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like whether it came from Trinity or
Mendocino or Sonoma or what or whatnot,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it went on dead tour, it was Humboldt
County organic outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and that's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what you were mentioning is,
you know, Humboldt is the BC of,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, of the States pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like anybody that was anybody that wanted
to be a pot grower moved to California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then once they were like, Oh, we're in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what do we do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Humboldt again, probably didn't have
a fucking maternity ward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't need one because there was only a
few fucking people that lived there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden the cannabis
craze came.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course they were like, Oh,
well I move up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can name it in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you when I first moved to
Mendocino County in the nineties,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was so few people moving here from
outside that everyone thought I was a cop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you look like a cop.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, fuck that dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you, I mean, we want to talk
about dead tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I saw a cop tackle somebody
on the lot with dreadlocks down to his ass
[SPEAKER_01]: and then pull out handcuffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say you can't tell what an undercover
cop looks like, but you can tell what the
[SPEAKER_02]: regular cop looks like.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like that, you know, but the only
reason I said that is because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: before like what we call the green rush
where people weren't moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people didn't move to the towns that
I was moving to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like out of towners didn't come there
within five, six years as medical advanced
[SPEAKER_01]: and sort of the green rush occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got overwhelmed by much like you were
saying with BC, almost none of the growers
[SPEAKER_01]: from Mendo were born in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all transplants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was a small core certainly
that was from there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you added them up by like number,
it was probably like 90, 90, 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10% were from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the same thing with BC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like again, I'm not going to pull,
you know, I think BC has produced and
[SPEAKER_02]: still does produce phenomenal growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was saying that back in the day,
most of those growers and therefore a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of their genetics came from, you know,
East or South.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's a debate on that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like not so much in, but just in the sense
of where is something from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, like the, you know,
we have this came from, came through the
[SPEAKER_01]: came through because there's this whole
thing where like, Oh, the Kush is from
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what's the story of the Kush?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, Oh, well it's this clone
from the Emerald triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then pollen from some stuff we got
from Neville and Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it happened in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and again, back when I was
growing the Kush before it was Kush kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of thing, it was just basically the,
you know, from the Kush region of
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I would say if people say,
well, where's the, where's the Hindu Kush
[SPEAKER_02]: from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, probably the Hindu Kush mountains,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like these are, they might've,
you know, took a cutting or a seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they might've brought something
back during the war times, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: which a lot of the genetics did,
you know, come from soldiers returning
[SPEAKER_02]: from fucking overseas and bringing seed
that they, uh, that they grabbed and
[SPEAKER_02]: planted in California, Florida,
fucking Wyoming, fuck anywhere,
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just what ended up happening is
where all the, uh, cool people or where
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the population that were like-minded
ended up moving to in Canada, it would be
[SPEAKER_02]: BC, you know, in California, it was going
to be probably San Francisco or that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, following kind of the whole hippie
movement and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say, I don't say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't say that the strain or their
genetics came from, uh, Southwest,
[SPEAKER_02]: Southwest, Southwestern Ontario.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could say that they most likely came
through and they probably came through
[SPEAKER_02]: California to get to BC.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, when you get strains like
Texada, Texada time warp, there's certain,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, and I was, I found some seed that from
Gabriola, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, um, where'd they come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's people on the Island that
will, will claim or, and rightfully so
[SPEAKER_02]: say, well, Texada came from Texada because
they say it came from California and we
[SPEAKER_02]: took a, we took pollen from Ontario or we
took pollen from fucking, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: some seed that we got out of Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I used to order seeds from
fucking Africa back in nation days,
[SPEAKER_02]: like literally from, uh, uh, uh,
seats dealer out of fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I'm looking to South Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the Swazi and Swazi pepper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was another strain, but,
uh, you know, I would use that in my
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding program or, you know,
I'm going to put that in quotations again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would use that when I was making seeds
and, uh, that made that strain from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it originate here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seed did, but the genetics that it
came from obviously didn't come from here
[SPEAKER_02]: because we have very little, if any land
races as same as BC has very little.
[SPEAKER_02]: To any same as, you know, California,
they might, I, they might have a land race
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know of one.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, I mean, I think, I think most,
most California breeding, if I had to
[SPEAKER_01]: guess like what the very inception of
California breeding is, it was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do we make these sativas that we're
getting free seeds with these kilos we're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we make them finish in our area?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, I have some Mexican and that
stuff seems to finish earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe I'll take some of this tie or
Columbia and I'll cross it to Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was literally very like very,
it was very, I don't think people had
[SPEAKER_01]: goals other than the fact of like,
I need this to finish before January.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that's where a lot of the,
you know, genetics were built and why they
[SPEAKER_02]: were built because I know, and that's why,
again, going back to the East coast,
[SPEAKER_02]: West coast, um, we had draft dodgers that
fucking ran the border and, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: and brought their genetics up to
Southwestern Ontario again, because being
[SPEAKER_02]: so close to Detroit, so close to Buffalo,
you know, the most Southern part of this
[SPEAKER_02]: country, um, the soil, the so on,
so forth, Perth County conspiracy,
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole kind of deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what were we breeding for?
[SPEAKER_02]: What was I breeding for?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't breeding for anything other than
I want to take that fucking strain and
[SPEAKER_02]: grow it in my house, in my basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to run it for 14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to find, so, and again,
my, a lot of my, I miss, I was a sativa
[SPEAKER_02]: lover.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted, if I could grow, uh,
an original haze in six weeks that
[SPEAKER_02]: produced, uh, that one and a half pounds
per light, I'd be in heaven.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my whole program.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it was about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, when I use the, I used to read
Neville's catalogs and sensei and God,
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that was in that 45 to 50 day
range just looked attractive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, you know, I, I didn't get any,
I didn't believe any of their shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really put the fucking, uh, the
Amsterdam guys through a lot of shit in my
[SPEAKER_02]: years, just because I called bullshit on a
lot of them because I grew out a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: their strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, this is, you know,
I'm at 60 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to argue at a 55 or 60 day
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine with me inside, but you're
saying 45 today, 45 to 50 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yeah, don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and they're giving me the
fucking yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, yeah, don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, but again, maybe again,
that's business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they need to, they want to sell that
seed and they want to sell that seed to
[SPEAKER_02]: be, um, attractive to the indoor grower or
attractive to the North American grower
[SPEAKER_02]: who, if they are going to grow outdoors,
they want it to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, in September, they need it to be done
by October.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, when you, when you look
at like California history before the
[SPEAKER_01]: helicopters, people were fine with things
taking into November.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: When there was no police pressure and they
weren't worried about their crop getting
[SPEAKER_01]: chopped.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: November's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden you get camp and you get
all these helicopters in the sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, when can I pull down in
September?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That extra two months is a real prop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three months.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an extra problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had snow that we had to worry about up
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the cops, the cops here grow in
August.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the choppers are in the air in August,
September, maybe kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, uh, we have to be down ideally
end of September, early October.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go anything past that, bud rot and
stuff like that, you know, we still get
[SPEAKER_02]: the humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are surrounded by the great lakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get, you know, we get the cold,
uh, the hot days, the cold nights,
[SPEAKER_02]: we get bud rot, like you wouldn't fucking
believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I believe, I believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, I think as, as some of these
States like New York and New Jersey and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of these new England start to
open up and what they want is they want
[SPEAKER_01]: all these California bread strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, because that's what's famous and they
want to sell the name, but what they
[SPEAKER_01]: really should be after is the Canadian
bread stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they, they, again, but they're like
we say before the BC bud is going to sell
[SPEAKER_02]: the SW on Ontario, but they're going to,
what the fuck does that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the Quebec, not getting the Quebec
bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to say, Oh, I know Quebec.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to know of Ontario and
Ontario is the biggest fucking most
[SPEAKER_02]: populated state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it definitely by far has the most pock
rows in it simply because of per capita,
[SPEAKER_02]: the amount of fucking, maybe not per
capita, but because of the amount of,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, people population.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, um, it's going to be a hard sell
to say Canadian, Canadian buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all going to say BC bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, uh, it's what's going to sell it
kind of thing, unfortunately, or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, fortunately, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, to me, I really don't could give
any fuck of a less honestly, but,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, it is, it is hard for me
here trying to sell down into the States
[SPEAKER_02]: unless they, they knew me or they knew
the, uh, genetics I was growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And high times their office knew what I
was doing because I used to fly down there
[SPEAKER_02]: with, um, weighed out ACE and weighed out
quarters in glass jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I also, what was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a 25th anniversary party.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had Cypress Hill and Joan Jett and
whoever else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I supplied all the pot to that party
because high times couldn't really afford,
[SPEAKER_02]: let alone back then, especially the high
end pot, all the super, super nice nugs
[SPEAKER_02]: that you see in that magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see Snoop Dogg with a big fucking
plate of buds in front of them and big
[SPEAKER_02]: joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: They rent all that pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: They rent it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They rent it rent.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can rent weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They rent weed for the Photoshop,
uh, for the photo op.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then anything that is smoked,
they're paying four or five, $600 an
[SPEAKER_02]: ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're just, when they were telling me
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they're like, oh fuck, man,
they're rolling another fucking big fat
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking, uh, blunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to cost us fucking $300.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what a bunch of clowns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you got to remember what era it was
though, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know Sean was trying to get us
to talk about like our, our, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, some of our Amsterdam and cup
experiences because we overlapped,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, when I would go,
I went to, uh, three cups in the nineties,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think like 95, 97, 98.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I experienced was that like you
were just saying all the best weed was set
[SPEAKER_01]: aside for like the celebrities and the
people that were going to pay top dollar
[SPEAKER_01]: for it and the people that wanted to show
up and like, they didn't care if they
[SPEAKER_01]: dropped mad coin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was actually like one of the worst
weeks or months to visit Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you were just a normal person,
they're like, well, we have good weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're going to sell it for three times
what it's worth.
[SPEAKER_01]: North American tax, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to pay the North American tax
because we have all these celebrities
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in and we have all these musicians
and stuff in these entourages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got all this weed and hash that
aside just for them and we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: charge them out the nose for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can't give it to you unless you
want to pay this like exorbitant price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was like, it gets ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, New York is the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: LA was the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: New York and LA obviously were the highest
markets, I think ever any place in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when high times used to do like in the
very back of the pages, like the prices
[SPEAKER_02]: from around the world and around the
country and how much an eighth was and how
[SPEAKER_02]: much an ounce was and stuff, it was always
LA and New York at the fucking top kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with working with high times and Kyle
knew my genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, when he was coming here to
buy it and shipping it back to Detroit,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would send Nugs down to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a thing going where I'd mail it
to the high times office and then inside
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, I hope this gets you busted,
you fucking douchebags.
[SPEAKER_02]: And putting in all this hate mail with a
half pound of pot in it kind of thing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the 25th anniversary party was
coming up, they reached out to me and
[SPEAKER_02]: said, hey, listen, you know, would you be
interested in, you know, selling us pot?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you know, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I mean, we've been doing it
enough kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, what were you guys thinking?
[SPEAKER_02]: They threw out a number and it was
something like, fuck, like three grand a
[SPEAKER_02]: pound or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, and US.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, OK, let me think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, thinking to myself,
what fucking kind of people are these
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking morons?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I call them back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, listen, I can't take three grand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and they're like, Kyle's like,
you know, Pete, that's pretty fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, OK, I'll do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take twenty four hundred dollars a
pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: US.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to mail a few boxes of jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't like I didn't mail zipline or
freezer bag half pounds of pot other than
[SPEAKER_02]: what they wanted for the party,
which was just a few pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mailed probably at least a pound
that was already weighed out and sealed in
[SPEAKER_02]: glass jars with fucking homemade labels on
every jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would I would mail them separately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I got down there,
I sat in Steve's office.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was either Bloomy's office or.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's one other office.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I would just I would sit in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: office and they would come in like one at
a time and choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like and I was like, listen,
it's fucking I think I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stiffing them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have charged 50 bucks an eighth
kind of thing because I could.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like I was shipping literally
jars that were cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like my my nicest stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that's a risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to sit on the couch with Jack
Herrera and I was super stoked because I
[SPEAKER_02]: was like, listen, Jack, I want you to
smoke this Golden Haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bred it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I used some genetics that,
you know, there's NL five skunk one that
[SPEAKER_02]: made his that sense he used to make
history.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used a version of keeping that kind of
blend in mind because it was exactly what
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my strain, I wanted, like I said
before, a short fat sativa giving high
[SPEAKER_02]: from a plant that's going to finish in
less than 60 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could grow in a fucking room with
nine foot ceilings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like when he when he,
you know, tried my my stuff and he's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: wow, that's fucking really nice,
tasty, so on, so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made my fucking it made my career at
that time kind of thing just to get there
[SPEAKER_02]: and and smoke a joint with them at the
same time, having who was the head of who
[SPEAKER_02]: was a Hagar Hagar.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is Hager.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Stephen Hager.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would I think I was sitting in his
office, actually, because he was the head
[SPEAKER_02]: honcho.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was selling fucking quarters and ace
and shit like that pre jarred up to the
[SPEAKER_02]: entire staff kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the party was, you know,
that night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, they paid me fucking
ridiculous amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and I took less far less than what
they were offering me because I was kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of honored one that I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, supply the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was also making a shitload of money
by selling them by private growers jar
[SPEAKER_02]: collection kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a testament to London because
like, you don't know how hard it is like
[SPEAKER_00]: being on on the Internet and talking to
weed guys trying to say that southwestern
[SPEAKER_00]: Ontario had fucking great pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody believes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just like, you can't have great
pot, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you have is fucking cities and
cornfields.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, it comes down to population.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you when you have 10 to 15 times the
amount of people jammed into a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: area, there's going to be phenomenal pot
growers as well as the the the people that
[SPEAKER_02]: really want to find that unique strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they travel the world, maybe not for
pot, but due to the amount of people,
[SPEAKER_02]: the population, they travel all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they fucking find pot in Thailand
or North Africa or someplace and like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, I got a couple of seeds, I throw them
my fucking in my shoe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just because of the amount of
people that we have coming back here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, why I would always say that I
think Southwestern Ontario produces some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the best pot growers and genetics
passing through in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that, though, is due to community
building because like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the hemp nation thing, like when that
happened and you were offering what you
[SPEAKER_00]: did at that place, a lot of people learned
a lot from access.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even it literally planted the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a lot of people, right, because Chris
gave gave people the option to buy their
[SPEAKER_02]: own seed, not take bagweed and find a seed
and not know, you know, what the fuck it
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were we were kind of weeding out some
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were telling you what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will tell you it's going to be
something within this range because it is
[SPEAKER_02]: an F1.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just took this sensi seed and we took
this greenhouse seed and we grew them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the mother was this and the dad was
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what they look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is when they finished and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we gave them an educated guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was literally planting the seed of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I started that Grow Your Tuition
campaign in London here, just for all the
[SPEAKER_02]: students, right, giving them discounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a coupon on a on a flyer that gave
them a discount on grow guides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and then, like I said, information,
the best thing about information is it's
[SPEAKER_02]: free.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wanted to come down on the Sundays
and we have cultivation talks,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I didn't mind sharing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking love talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we were doing this back in the mid
80s, mid 90s kind of thing back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really it's actually really hard for
me to tell people today with like what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing right now and all the forums
and IG and all the ways that people can
[SPEAKER_01]: connect how tough it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get information, how how small groups
used to be, how rare it was to find people
[SPEAKER_01]: that like knew what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing is like I always
I still consider like 90s to be like the
[SPEAKER_01]: golden era of weed, just in the sense
because basically any like weed was rare
[SPEAKER_01]: enough that it could take too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could not look that great.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it worked really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to gain popularity,
you know, because there was there was only
[SPEAKER_01]: so much of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like a lot of the famous strains in the
90s rose to the top because they were
[SPEAKER_01]: really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and they didn't really have a
hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people nowadays,
you know, the placebo effect comes into
[SPEAKER_02]: play a lot with all these new genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, there's a lot of fire out there,
but there's people that are just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, well, this is this strain,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is a cush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, and it has the smell of a cush,
but it has a you know, it doesn't really
[SPEAKER_02]: rock you like some of the others.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since since it, you know, smells like
it looks like it fucking must fucking be
[SPEAKER_05]: the close enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're just like, oh,
yeah, I'm super high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've done that with my my
clients at the Compassion Center where
[SPEAKER_02]: they were they were like, oh, you know
what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern Lights doesn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's you know, I've tried it and it's it's
just you know, I smoked it back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: 80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't didn't get me high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, the Northern Lights I have is
not the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I give them the Northern Lights that
is fire for other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, yeah, it didn't really do it
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, your mind is quite strong tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was infamous with my organic
traveler crew, like all the, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: glass blowers that were downstairs and all
this that thought they were these these
[SPEAKER_02]: pots knobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd be the same thing like,
oh, yeah, you know what, that's that
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff's, you know, it's not that great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they had that tasty bud shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That little fucking flavoring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You plant juicy J's tasty buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, whatever the fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would actually take some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would take fucking great pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, the triangle is one glass
blower.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just always against like,
yeah, I know that but he was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, I had this cherry bomb once and it was
fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I fucking took the cherry shit and
fucking did a little light mist on it kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of thing and put it in the jar and let it
sit there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and same fucking string that I gave
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Made the nugs look a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Made him look a little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, hey, listen, this is not
called cherry bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called cherry blossom.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy just came through.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's from Tobacco or fucking Peterborough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he opens it up and he's like,
oh, yeah, it smells like this is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: He fucking smokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, yeah, that's fucking see,
we need to find this this strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, fuck you, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the God damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that we fucking you smoke fucking two
weeks ago, you said was shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just put tasty bud on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now none of those guys would fucking
trust me to give him any fucking pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fuck no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you ruined that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking tasty bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, no, it's actually not kind
of thing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I've been accused of using that
on some of the blueberry stuff we put out
[SPEAKER_03]: the tasty bud stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when people smell like good blueberry
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is this is a syrup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people, you know,
and if you smell my B 93, like it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: it smells like not the blueberry smell,
but it smells like a pint of actual
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I see a little bit more that
that sweet earthy aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it's from it's from 93.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when we started to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's an it's an old fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going back to that era.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would have been I would have gotten
indirectly or basically it was when he was
[SPEAKER_02]: first releasing his blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Tony could have had it earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that Tony had with Simon and
they had cerebral in 94.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they split and Tony made Sag
Martha and Simon made Sirius.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think I think I think DJ Short
was with Tony, with Tony.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did the bubble gum and they
called it 94 blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked with Tony.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sold it through Tony first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they had some falling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think he moved to Dutch
Passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he got angry at all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he and then he moved it to
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the thing is and this is where
he met up with Steve and Red and I'll call
[SPEAKER_02]: him the air mechanic because I don't know
of a nickname for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he was a great grower, didn't do
anything huge, like 12 lights or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I if I'm not mistaken again,
Red would be the better information on the
[SPEAKER_02]: background on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I believe they bred the blue
satellite.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I know they were doing a grow out for
DJ and but that was a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the seed that I got was just before
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where I was thinking that it
might have came indirectly from DJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it would have been like I thought it
was like I know it was 93, but I thought
[SPEAKER_02]: it was actually from him and not from from
Tony.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it is it a clone that's still alive?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I literally just killed off like six
seventy five to 80 percent of my genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I'm just I'm retiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really frustrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually there today trying to
salvage what one of my staff from the
[SPEAKER_02]: center.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, if you can save me all these
strains, I'll find somebody to grow to to
[SPEAKER_02]: babysit him for you until you get over
this divorce shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I wanted to go into it like out of
the hundreds and twenty three hundred and
[SPEAKER_02]: twenty three strains that I had,
I had data collected on their use medical
[SPEAKER_02]: uses through the Compassion Center going
back almost 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because in Canada we cannot say,
well, this strain works with this medical
[SPEAKER_02]: condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I could do is saying out of the 30
people that suffer from MS, this is their
[SPEAKER_02]: the top selling indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the top selling sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's responsible, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would just be basically giving
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say again, it's data to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did it for like literally for almost
15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've collected this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the most important shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had it all fucking ready and packaged to
go into the LP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just fucking saw the dark side of
the fucking industry that was just chewing
[SPEAKER_02]: and spitting out anybody from the
movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I took a lot of heat from people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we talked about this last time
from, you know, people in the movement
[SPEAKER_02]: that thought I sold out by going to into
the LP legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's crazy because it's what
you've been working for your entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't fucking steer the boat if you're
standing on the shore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking yelling like, you know,
I mean, as like the best direction you
[SPEAKER_02]: can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I was doing with my
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm again, strange names or names to me
because I'm I'm out for the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a fuck what you call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to come back to the dog
shit where it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't really make a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I had a I had a strain I called warm
diarrhea.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was really marketable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was this one strain didn't
produce for the fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: But holy God, Jesus, did it ever smell
like dog shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking warm diarrhea, like hot summertime
fucking diarrhea squirted on your leg kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking I know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phenomenal fucking plot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like, so I called it that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fucking clone that I went to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was consulting a guy's garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: He fucking said these are my strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, where are they from?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I fuck, you know, my brother in
law gave me some of this and some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found some seed in this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one fucking one plant was like,
holy God, Jesus, that's nasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, with with Sam, when he was
doing his skunk and everybody was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, it's you know, that that and I just
had this conversation today, actually with
[SPEAKER_02]: my cousin, because he's like, I had a
skunk one back when back when Tilly was
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking growing for the center.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll find the picture because it may
it was a full page picture in high times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's this kid holding one of the nugs
up and he's holding his forearm and the
[SPEAKER_02]: nug is twice the size of this kid's
forearm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's you know, you grow the true skunk
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe is mainly grown for structure
more than that skunky smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm not mistaken, I think Sammy was
actually trying to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I was that's his claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys covered this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't follow like modern IG
culture and stuff, but like there's been a
[SPEAKER_00]: massive, massive movement on finding
roadkill skunk, which everyone because I
[SPEAKER_02]: was going to I make it that this the
cuttings that I sent out today,
[SPEAKER_02]: this guy and I don't know his fucking
name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll find out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he sent one of my Sasquatch,
a kid that works for me, who is like the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_02]: He ended up getting this fucking jar of
skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I opened it up and I was like,
holy fuck, that's my skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like and I called it roadkill
skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that was a name called
roadkill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a strain, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just it's just a reference to a type
of expression that can come from Afghanis
[SPEAKER_03]: or skunky plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, well, this this skunk one grew the
structure and the and my cousin just said,
[SPEAKER_02]: listen, if you get it, I want to breed
with it because it has the if it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: same cut that this guy's sending me,
it smells the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Nug looks the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to find out if the structure is the
same because the structure was what the
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk one was all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I have that big Nug that fucking can
hold itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, this Tilly kid that was
growing and we do it on an Ebb and Flow
[SPEAKER_02]: table.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were just spikes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just these big, beautiful,
fucking fragrant roadkill smell skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and I think I was I try to
put some of your guys podcasts on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't listen to podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in all honesty, the first and only
podcast I really listened to was like
[SPEAKER_02]: three nights ago when it was while I was
going to bed and I wanted to hear what we
[SPEAKER_02]: did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And something else came up and you guys
were talking about Sam's breeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to breed out the skunk one,
the skunky, you know, actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: and and focusing on structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, that's ironic because
that's what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was also chasing that that super
skunk kind of aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was this roadkill like,
yeah, because it doesn't smell like skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: when you spray that tarry kind of burnt.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it had that fucking you driving down
the fucking road and you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah, it had that smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe if I remember that from like
London, I definitely remember skunky
[SPEAKER_00]: smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I kind of relate it to like the
Heineken skunky beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell more than animal smell.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question for you, Sean.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is totally off topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does Canada get green Heineken bottles or
brown greens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can say Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I go to Holland in the 90s and they
have the Heineken Brewery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is like it was it moved now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like but it was in Amsterdam and they gave
tours, you know, and so if you buy a
[SPEAKER_01]: Heineken in Holland, it's in a brown
bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you talk you talk to like the Dutch
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, why why is it in a
green bottle in America?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, oh, because you guys are
dumb, but it's iconic over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want the green bottle, but it
oxidizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes the beer go skunky and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get it in Europe, it's a dark brown
bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, because we don't want the light to
fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But well, but that tastes classic taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like we have another beer used to this
like oxidized skunky beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like and he's like, you buy in
Heineken anywhere in Europe, it's in a
[SPEAKER_01]: brown bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to the USA, it's in a green bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, it's just advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have we have to we had two beers that
were like the pot beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was Heineken and Moosehead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Moosehead was also in a green bottle,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they both had that very skunky,
skunky like to get a six pack and some
[SPEAKER_00]: weed and smoke weed and smoke like and
drink Moosehead was like that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was like they paired.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you guys are so Canadian,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what's funny is I haven't drank
beer in like 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I just you know, I just had to
throw it out there because I was like
[SPEAKER_01]: shocked when they literally were like,
oh, we only do that to the dumb Americans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like legit what they said,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was like, oh, I guess that
includes Canadians.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's funny about what's funny
about the skunk, you know, is that like
[SPEAKER_01]: we're all so old now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this thing that tripped me out
because you don't feel old in your head,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though when you're getting old,
where I saw this thing where like the 90s
[SPEAKER_01]: are as far away now as the 60s were in the
90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's all these smokers that like
they all this stuff we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: all this stuff that's like our youth you
know, and you know, in our 20s and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else that was so common.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all legendary just words now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why they're hunting that skunk
is because it's gone away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while it was super common in the 90s
and there was lots of weed that was very
[SPEAKER_01]: skunky or had skunk type turps,
it's kind of gone away, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now it's like, you know,
we were talking about how B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bud rhymes or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like northern all these strains are
coming back again and they don't even have
[SPEAKER_01]: to be the actual strain anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just has to have the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the name is what survives the
population.
[SPEAKER_02]: The users are so young that they won't
know the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know they weren't.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were smoking the NL back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not smoking pot anymore kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know, like the big the big strain
back in my day was like the NL five skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the go to that was if,
you know, the center of the road,
[SPEAKER_02]: easy to grow, big yield, depending on what
phenotype you got, you know, it kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: was the best of all worlds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was again, it was an easy grower
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, to find anything like that,
I think like pot now is so pasteurized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as simple, you know, and sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: My man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I didn't have another question.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about the triple S C last
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you have any contact to any of
the good old boys that were part of that
[SPEAKER_02]: group?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we interviewed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correll, the original owner.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, was he out of Amsterdam or very much,
very much so.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a Dutch born.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but he's not originally from the States
that he didn't know he didn't move there.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he's he's definitely definitely Dutch.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did they have offsprings of the their
group in California?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they said they never worked with
anyone in the United States ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what not work with?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just thinking that after they were
there, that they move that after maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: some of their colleagues, staff or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to find out about the Golden Boy,
because the way I what I was told was that
[SPEAKER_02]: this strain came from Ontario.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wouldn't say maybe like more up
central, north of southwestern Ontario.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it came from the triple S C.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or somebody from that group that is now
living in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going back to like, like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he didn't have a strain called Golden
Boy either.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had they had like M1, M2,
M3, M4, M5, M6.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd have little names after,
but it'd be like Nigerian Kandahar or
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunk One or Basic Five.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very, very basic.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Williams Wonder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Small names like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: No Golden Boy, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you ask them, though, like,
yeah, if you can reach out and just ask
[SPEAKER_02]: them, because the story that I had was it
came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: From their group, and I believe it was
bred by them, and it might have had like
[SPEAKER_02]: an M24 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But and it was a it was a 45 day finishing
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what was so was a fucking
crazy, wasn't the best deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a really weird looking plant,
but it was 45 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it an indica or sativa?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say it would have leaned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say I wouldn't even say it was
leaned either way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to look at some of the
pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I think I even have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have the picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like Mighty Might fast,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, it was super fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was ridiculously fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a great strain on its own,
but it was great for breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I again made the M1 to
what's called Golden Haze because there
[SPEAKER_02]: was other things and it was chemo and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skunk in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we crossed it with the Golden Boy
because I wanted to speed it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my my what I was looking for was a
fast growing short fat sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the the haze, there was a early skunk
chemo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crossed with the haze and then we crossed
it with the Golden Boy to speed it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had phenotype all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I found one that seemed to fit the
the mold I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just I didn't have a seed of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a cutting of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we did breed it with some other
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy Skifa, who unfortunately has
passed away.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he he crossed it with some blue
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it was even like blue skunk out to
look it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might still have some of those seeds,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just wanted to find the lineage of
that Golden Boy because I was told it came
[SPEAKER_02]: from the Triple SC boys early 90s,
maybe mid 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were done by then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they were done.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were long gone by then.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just thinking if it was offspring
from them and even being literally
[SPEAKER_02]: offspring, kids of theirs or something
like that, that moved to Ontario and
[SPEAKER_02]: brought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I wonder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if his son moved out there
because his son took over the company
[SPEAKER_03]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the one who runs it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this wasn't anybody that I
knew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was sure that was a story that was
brought to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, the strain was a really
unique strain, but it was super fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, back in we knew it was
going to be a breeding staple for us until
[SPEAKER_02]: we grew it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're just like, yeah, this plant is
fucked up looking kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It did you really weird shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you like C 99 at all since you were
looking for plants that were fast,
[SPEAKER_03]: hazy?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a C 99 right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came from this guy tank out of Toronto
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to look at my notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just tends to be one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't stand out as the 45 day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might've been like a 55 day.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the stuff we do was like 56 day
kind of stuff because we had 50 lights and
[SPEAKER_02]: I needed to produce, I needed things to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finish all around the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did, we did do this in the 99.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did have a, a following.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wanted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did want to bring it in and incorporate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That photographer that you couldn't
remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andre Grossman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody commented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was going to be a male
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, did I put that in the notes and I
sent you notes?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, you have to bring this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, yeah, Andre Grossman.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a phenomenal fucking phenomenal
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was another photographer called
himself the Yop.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did like the first really micro
tri-chrome photography.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, he, yeah, he shot through a
microphone, a microscope and, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: he did some pretty interesting,
uh, photography.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like one of the, he was the first,
I think that did micro photography on
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, but, uh, uh, Grossman,
uh, really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, super talented for, he's the one that
shot, uh, Kyle's special blend poster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, and, uh, I lost track of
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I should try to find him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'd like to talk to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last time I spoke to him, I believe was
right after nine 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I call him, I was trying to find him
in more of a panic because being a
[SPEAKER_02]: photographer myself, if he was in the
city, he would be the type of guy that's
[SPEAKER_02]: running towards the fucking buildings to
take photos before they came down kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was kind of concerned about,
uh, about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, yeah, we did a few,
uh, I'm going to say shoots together
[SPEAKER_02]: because he was well, well more established
than I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but he did help me because I would,
I would find out through him what he was
[SPEAKER_02]: getting paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, like if you're going
to use the centerfold for me, I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: get paid the same or so close kind of
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well back then, like you did, did you do
school for photography?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started, uh, uh, did a three year
program here in London.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you were like early, early
cannabis photographer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many photographers were around back
then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't very many of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, um, did you ever meet Ang Lee?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, Andre and I both were listed as
contributing photographers, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the, um, inside cover, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But he ended up getting lots of,
a lot more centerfolds, uh, covers and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, and yeah, I don't,
I think he might have went to school.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually, I just met with Fanshawe and
we're going to, uh, I'm going to put
[SPEAKER_02]: together a scholarship in my name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ironically for, uh, the program because I
want to, um, uh, I want, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: kids to know that you don't have to be a
fucking portrait shit photographer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can be a pot photographer
and still make good and kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, even though I went to jail for
it and shit like that, I think it makes a
[SPEAKER_02]: story for a scholarship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like, yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode you mentioned,
like when you were at the border,
[SPEAKER_00]: you had 10,000 negatives, like 10,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of photos, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh dude, I had boxes and I just found,
uh, um, I'd love to have you scan some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever thought about doing a book?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you keep track of the strains in these
pictures?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, did you write on it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: What I used to do, um, is I would take a
picture, um, of the plant and then I take
[SPEAKER_02]: a, uh, a piece of paper and I'd write what
the strain was and put it in the picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would do a shoot of that
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Close ups and, and, uh, full plant shots
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, if I, if I liked it enough
for, and I thought high times would like
[SPEAKER_02]: it, I would shoot it on a positive on a
slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they had better, uh, color
saturation and it was better for them
[SPEAKER_02]: though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and then, uh, a lot of the times I
would bring out my old super eight video
[SPEAKER_02]: camera and videotape what I was doing in
the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so I would have reference,
uh, because I was doing it for information
[SPEAKER_02]: for myself on different genetics as well
as for, for high times and for future.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's going to be super
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know if you understand that,
but because, because so much has changed
[SPEAKER_03]: and so many things have been renamed over
the years, it was a really prime time
[SPEAKER_03]: during those years.
[SPEAKER_03]: To get point, like when I, when you say
like point of origin for like land race
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, this is like point of origin for a
lot of these strains, like in their
[SPEAKER_03]: natural habitat, like getting pictures of
let's say Romulan in Canada during this
[SPEAKER_03]: era, that's very special.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't have a lot of pictures like
that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a strain called biker Bob,
which was a big out in California and BC
[SPEAKER_02]: for a while there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, who else have that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I did this shoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, with high times in mind, I think red
set it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe Mark, uh, no, I don't think
Mark set it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody set it up, but like it was up in
North of Whistler and, um, I used to
[SPEAKER_02]: blindfold myself on all of these photo
shoots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't go to a photo shoot,
especially if I didn't know the people,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, when blindfolded.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just wear sunglasses and I would
take the inside of the sunglasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if they said I didn't have to do
that, they're like, dude, we know who you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to pop up on that radar ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know what, dude,
you have a list of, and on that list is
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody that knows about your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be on that fucking list.
[SPEAKER_02]: If something goes south, I don't want to
be on that list kind of smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we ended up in some really fucked
up back shit area countries, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: good old boys, million dollar fucking
grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when I was working in the interior,
we ended up going to wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And definitely a J or something like that,
but super nice fucking guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, ironically, his, he blew his
fucking transformer on the pole.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was there, sparks flying
everywhere, fucking all the lights going
[SPEAKER_02]: off his entire fucking crews for,
I met this guy this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's when I was working on that,
uh, greenhouse and, um, his entire fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: crew fucking bailed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody fucking ran because they knew
fucking high it was coming, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, it's on fire kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm so used to being the guy that,
you know, back in the nation days,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the one that had the pickup truck with
the topper on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could fit all the pop plants and
everything in the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not scared of the fucking cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think I can outrun a lot of the
cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was just like, fucking what are we
doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you like, we need to take this
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to shut this door.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to screw this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, fucking right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were there for a couple hours maybe
before the hydro people showed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and there was all, I think,
I think he put up his own fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: transformer on a pole or something and,
and it blew their transformer or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was definitely like, but you know,
we were just like, we're here to fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I don't want to know where
your fucking garden is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, so I'm blindfolded when I get
here, I'm blindfolded when I leave,
[SPEAKER_02]: but while I'm here, I'm your fucking best
friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do whatever it fucking takes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I ended up, I ended up always,
you know, even at that garden,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what the strains were
because I think, one, I was a little
[SPEAKER_02]: worried because I didn't know what I was
walking into on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a friend of a friend kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I got there, you could tell it
was definitely organized guys on two
[SPEAKER_02]: wheels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want, but the biker Bob,
you know, most of the guys, riding the
[SPEAKER_02]: bike of Bob's road bikes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to turn on the lights so
you can see me better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you bring your seed case with you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I didn't, I want to start going through
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't start going through it,
like sitting on my desk downstairs because
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually want to go through it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to, I want to go through it on the
video with you so we could just,
[SPEAKER_03]: so it'd be easier, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should just do a whole session on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just do a whole session.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to find like, cause a lot of the
seeds I have are just like seeds that came
[SPEAKER_02]: to me with a story.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the best part, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, cause that's what people want to
hear is the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's these, these seeds can evoke a
lot of these stories that you probably
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't even remember that you had about
certain strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, like the Elmwood, I normally
don't know what the fuck the Elmwood is,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Elmwood is a strain that was
super popular in certain circles.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Southwestern Ontario for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But after this, people are going to be
chasing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going to be trying to find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a shitload of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll send it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was saying is, yeah, but see,
that's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like now, you know, would, would,
I'm going to call him double D because I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know that's in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to work for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's out on the East coast, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if he would know about that box story,
yeah, I mean, Ed would know about it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't know too many people that want
to talk to Ed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you were referring to, to,
to Rosenthal, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone in the thing was like,
no, he's referring to Ed Borg.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, no, he's referring to
Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knows Borg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, just because again, that's what
he told Mr. Hampton.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve when, when he was working in
Switzerland with those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, again, everything that we
talk about is, and I was just reading
[SPEAKER_02]: something today about the natives,
a native saying where, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: people like you, we want to remember our
purpose on this planet is to remember our
[SPEAKER_02]: legacy or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it should be to continue our story
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything that we, you know,
like we're discussing here, as we said
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier, was this is what I was told.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of this shit's just not written
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, and it's not going to be written
down for obvious reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why, you know, when I get to
meet guys like you, I'm saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, if you know somebody that knows
somebody, this is what I heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they might say, yeah, there's no,
there's no way that happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm saying, okay, well, at least I
know now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's kind of the purpose of this podcast
is that a lot of the history is oral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of history is like verbally
passed on, you know, and it always was
[SPEAKER_02]: native shit down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we had some carvings in the,
in the, in the, on the walls in the caves,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, stretched out leather,
but no, we have a, everything is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, sit around the campfire and tell
stories and paint that to the young ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, when I was at rainbow
gatherings, you know, the granola funk was
[SPEAKER_02]: a camp that we were staying with and their
contribution was building a stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily, the one I went to, I was able to
help build a stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the elders could come and tell stories
about earlier years of the rainbow
[SPEAKER_02]: gathering and the history of the rainbow
gathering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, fuck, you know,
we need that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what this I, what I feel this
is, is for the, uh, for the canvas
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, for the, for the seeds is,
you know, a lot of this shit, this is,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, this is what I've been told.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we can find people to, like I say,
with the triple SC golden boy story,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, is that, you know, was somebody
pulling my leg with somebody that told me
[SPEAKER_02]: this did believe it because somebody told
them that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still tempted to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like the one person that I knew that
was worked with Neville helped them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't sure about using names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that, I think he'd be,
he would at least know something I would
[SPEAKER_03]: think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and like I said, what the story was
is, you know, there was, uh, somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: never was supposed to sell a bunch of
genetics to somebody never came through.
[SPEAKER_02]: He threw him in the back of a freezer when
he was pulling out of, I believe
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he came across them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He passed them on to Ed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Supposedly for like an outstanding debt or
something like that, or maybe just because
[SPEAKER_02]: he had them and they ended up,
um, with Steve in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever happened to the fast beer and
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fast party, the night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they still alive?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Ortega, which was one of them is
in the Louie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't, they didn't really like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said before, they didn't like any
of the strains that I liked, like the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the fast beer and the night, night,
night queen, uh, because they were,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, Sativas and, uh, Steven and red nose
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all big Indica fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they love the Ortega, you know,
um, I wish I could remember some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: other things I'll have to kind of go
through.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a thank you for joining us on this
journey.
