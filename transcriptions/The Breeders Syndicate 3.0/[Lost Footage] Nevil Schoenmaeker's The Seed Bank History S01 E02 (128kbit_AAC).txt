[SPEAKER_01]: All right, how's everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're live now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we are live.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to get this all set up so
people can actually see what we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about during everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how's everyone doing tonight?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see there's questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see how many people we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got quite a few people registered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see how many people pop on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see the registrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see how many people are in here
live.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys can, feel free to shout it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe I'll give them a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give everyone a few minutes since
it's a different kind of process than
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: People got to go check their email to get
the link and all that crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natsa's on the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we're going to talk about the
history of cannabis e-banks as we know
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are familiar with seed
banks as far as the attitude, more modern
[SPEAKER_01]: type seed banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is an industry that goes back a
long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we're going to be going
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to do most of the
illustrating from my end, like the old
[SPEAKER_01]: seed bank catalogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Natsa's going to try to handle most of
the talking because this is his specialty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if there's any questions I can
answer real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any chance you could get CSI on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would make one of the best
podcasts in cannabis history.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually sent a picture of that comment
to CSI so he can see it himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what else we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else I can answer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashplant to Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure Natsa will remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be available to watch for a short
period of time if you missed the live
[SPEAKER_01]: event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we can record it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not watched a Tony Alva flick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been so busy with fucking moving and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the importance of Triangle Kush to
the legacy heritage flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's going to be a very relevant
and important gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, OG Kush is the market,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Personal favorite cloner line to come from
Neville's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let Natsa answer that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, NL5 Hayes has the majority vote,
I would say, but I'm a fan of super scum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultra scum, super scum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone asked, hi there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been, I'm very new to this all
however.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been creating my own for a couple of
years, crossing hemp, high CBD varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis strains for my own personal
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's absolutely a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man, I came into it when,
the forums were the source of knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: and my God, my God, how much has changed,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing, bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It finally worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, everyone for the technical
difficulties, but it appears that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: see my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can everybody hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you guys hear him?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see your hands, Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mounted this so I can illustrate
as you talk through certain things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with the CBait catalogs,
the Sensi catalogs, SSSC, we got here,
[SPEAKER_01]: we got even the original sacred packs as
you talk about any of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just start rolling, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the first edition of our new
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, like we've never done this
before, hopefully it works a little
[SPEAKER_00]: smoother than live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be able to do a couple more
cooler things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be able to see people's
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully bear with us with some
technical difficulties if they occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully we'll be able to chat a
bunch of a bunch of cool shit and it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: work a little easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be able to see your comments a
little easier than we were on live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is sort of like the new thing
we're going to try for lack of a better
[SPEAKER_00]: way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll just try to bullshit for a while
and get where we can on some of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know where we want to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought maybe this thing would be good
to talk about like some some seed bank
[SPEAKER_00]: history.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, obviously, like now there's a
lot of stuff that's kind of coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the woodwork where people are talking
about a lot of famous old cuts from the
[SPEAKER_00]: 80s and 90s seed lines and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that like there was a bunch
of people that didn't maybe didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the history behind all how all
that occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so obviously, since it's weed history,
it's not entirely exact.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is everything we're going to talk
about is the best that we know it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be some different information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everything could be entirely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to give it our best shot
to give you what we think and what we know
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why we wanted to start with
like sort of Neville and sort of Holland
[SPEAKER_00]: history is that's not where like seed
history started, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was stuff going on in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was sacred.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was plenty of private breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Holland, that was sort of the first
place where you could literally be a
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody and just send them money and get
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of in California, at least from my
knowledge and experience, you kind of had
[SPEAKER_00]: to know somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of had to be connected a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you had to be within certain
circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, you know, I grew up in the
Midwest and there was no access to seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no culture or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only places that we knew how to get
weed were dead shows and home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could mail order from Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could you could fly out there and buy
them direct and kind of try to bring them
[SPEAKER_00]: back yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, that's kind of where like modern
weed history as far as like most people's
[SPEAKER_00]: access to it begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in certain circles,
if you were in the Pacific Northwest,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, obviously it starts
before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Neville put an ad in High Times in 84
or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that started what Matt's holding up
right now is his 85 catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because Holland's because Holland's
laws had changed, then they were sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: the first place that could like really
make seeds available to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result of that, like that's where
a lot of people got most of their seed
[SPEAKER_00]: stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't from connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't from friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were small groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Neville, SSC, you know,
a couple other small places.
[SPEAKER_00]: They allowed everybody, people from
Florida, people from Chicago, people from
[SPEAKER_00]: New York, people from North Carolina,
Virginia, wherever to just if they had the
[SPEAKER_00]: balls to go there, they had the balls to
order it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where that's where kind of
like our modern story starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where like a lot of a lot of
seed strains and a lot of lines that
[SPEAKER_00]: became famous to everybody like Hayes,
Northern Lights, Skunk One, G13,
[SPEAKER_00]: Maple Leaf, all these things we talk about
now that have become kind of legendary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really where like 99 percent of the
population really first started getting
[SPEAKER_00]: access to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Neville is kind of unique in
cannabis history in that he had the balls
[SPEAKER_00]: to start it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sort of got to as you know,
by the mid 80s, persecution in California
[SPEAKER_00]: and America in general had really kind of
ramped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the Reagan years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drug laws had gotten intense and so a lot
of a lot of breeders and a lot of growers
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of guys with seed, they sort of
took what they had and they fled to
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Amsterdam basically got famous
because it was able to collect a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that was going on in America and not
so much stuff it had itself, but really
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that was going on in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did do some trips.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly true that Neville,
the drunkers from Central currency,
[SPEAKER_00]: other people, you know, some people went
to Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was shit that they called,
obviously, the hippie hashish trail where
[SPEAKER_00]: people started going to the Far East and
poking around to proceed stock and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but Holland is really where it
consolidated like Matt's holding it up
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look on the left page that he has
up, there's like an order form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could literally write down what
amount you wanted of what strains and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could send them fucking money and they
would send you seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was pretty revolutionary,
I think, because that had never happened
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't just ask a stranger for a
bunch of a bunch of illegal marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: beans and get a hold of them back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we thought maybe it would be good
to start like on a historical basis
[SPEAKER_00]: because most of the stuff that we grow
today in some way, there's a lot you could
[SPEAKER_00]: trace a lot of it back to that first five
or ten years in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say like eighty five to ninety five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Matt would agree that the vast
majority of today's modern cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can at least tie some of it back to
that era.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so Neville did two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville had the balls to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then secondly, he was kind of able to
collect a bunch of people's previous work,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, for instance, Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim Ortega, Seattle Greg from the NL crew,
Mel, you know, Sam Skunkman, various
[SPEAKER_00]: groups like that, and then his own
travels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he kind of became the first person
to be able to blend all those things
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like before him, nobody was crossing skunk
in northern lights because the skunk crew
[SPEAKER_00]: and the northern lights crew didn't know
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was crossing NL five, you know,
with Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those that crew didn't know each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a way, he got lucky because I mean,
like imagine today, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could collect nobody knew about Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knew about cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knew about sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knew about all these things that
are famous in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And imagine you got to be the person that
blended them together first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sold and then resold them to
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like that's kind of like what that's
kind of what Neville got to do in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is you got to be first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and a bunch of people copied him
and a bunch of people came along and added
[SPEAKER_00]: their own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, like just like every other
breeder, nobody started shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's on the shoulders of who came
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you all pick up, you know, the breeding
projects and the clones and the seeds as
[SPEAKER_00]: you get into weed, as you come around and
then, you know, you kind of add your own
[SPEAKER_00]: kick to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what every breeder has done,
you know, from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, the first breeders in,
say, like America were taking all the
[SPEAKER_00]: import weed, like the Colombian and the
Panamanian and the Thai and the Mexican
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that stuff came in from seed,
you know, seeded weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So literally every time you bought weed,
you got three seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most most breeding in America was a
bunch of sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's all there was, was sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you got hash, hash was Afghans,
but you didn't find any seeds for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part in hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is a really super important
part, too, because most people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: around today don't realize that the influx
of modern Afghanis and stuff happened more
[SPEAKER_01]: in the 80s, late 70s, early 80s,
as opposed to have always been existing
[SPEAKER_01]: and always a part of the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it it it changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, most I would say, for instance,
that like most most things that people
[SPEAKER_00]: were growing in the 70s was a blend of
sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because that's what that's what
everybody had access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it'd be Mexican Colombians,
it'd be Mexican Colombians and Thais.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be all these type of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Afghans were super fucking rare,
like really rare because somebody had to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to Afghanistan or Pakistan or one of
those regions get seeds and they had to go
[SPEAKER_00]: in the 60s and 70s when travel took a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to go, they had to collect them
and they had to smuggle them back into
[SPEAKER_00]: America, either mailing them or on their
person somehow.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but there was literal tons and tons and
tons of Mexican and Colombian and Thai and
[SPEAKER_00]: Panamanian and all these different
Jamaican that was coming in in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in bricks and stuff to America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was all seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that was kind of like the.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result of that, most American
breeding was like in core groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just little groups of people,
friend groups, extended friend groups,
[SPEAKER_00]: that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, so that's kind of
how it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really, I mean, it really wasn't
until Holland that most of America got
[SPEAKER_00]: access to like a lot of little groups of
people were up to doing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously, like Prohibition was pretty
heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you just there was no way
for you to know what what Seattle Greg and
[SPEAKER_00]: the NL crew was doing in the Pacific
Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were trying to avoid getting busted.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Greg's commented several times that it
was just like watching dominoes fall
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly watching their friends get
popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result of it being sketchy and
you trying to be underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That meant that most people didn't have
access to what you were doing because they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't want most people to know what they
were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to in order to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was there was,
you know, some stuff going on in Mendocino
[SPEAKER_00]: County and Humboldt County and,
you know, Santa Cruz and the Central Coast
[SPEAKER_00]: area that was mountainous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, people were getting away
with pretty good sized things and breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unless you were connected to those
crews, if you lived in Nebraska,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you lived in Florida, if you lived in,
you know, Chicago, like where I was born
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything like that, you had zero access
to those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had no idea whatsoever what was going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just had, you know, if you were lucky,
you got some imports.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why we thought starting with
Neville and starting with the seed banks
[SPEAKER_00]: is because Neville was really Neville was
probably one of the biggest reasons why
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sold between he had when he started the
seed bank, you know, he sold millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars worth of seed, millions of dollars
all over America, all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what he did is he gave thousands
and thousands and thousands of people the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to grow their own and the ability
to get some of the best American genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: that were happening that people didn't
have access to before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in a way, you know,
he kind of took a lot of very famous weed
[SPEAKER_00]: characters and he made their stuff famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is really kind of what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's he made some rock stars,
you know, so I was talking about it
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anybody was listening to like,
you know, the first Breeders Syndicate
[SPEAKER_00]: interview, Matt, Matt and Conza got to
interview Seattle Greg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Seattle Greg
said in that interview was that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he sent a whole bunch of NL seed
because he saw that advertisement that
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville put in that in high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: He literally, you know, reached out to
Neville and, you know, he sent Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lights and, you know,
within five or six years of that time,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody in the Northern Lake crew has
gotten busted and it would have been lost
[SPEAKER_00]: to time and nobody would have known
anything about it other than some legends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he had gotten it to Holland before
they all got busted and lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's a there's a thing
when people are asking questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't gotten to the questions yet
because I just been kind of rapping about
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a button where you can people
can go and they can ask questions and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll try to get some of those questions
answered a little bit later after we roll
[SPEAKER_00]: through some of this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I'm in my mid 40s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, literally, like I said
before, I knew how to get seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew how to get good weed from Grateful
Dead shows and Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went to Holland in 1994.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was able just as an 18
year old, nobody to just walk into various
[SPEAKER_00]: places and buy seed stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I didn't know anything about I
knew barely anything about growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally got my first seeds that I had
access to because I could buy a plane
[SPEAKER_00]: ticket and I could fly to Amsterdam as a
kid and I could buy seeds and I could
[SPEAKER_00]: bring them back to my spot and we could
pop them and we could see what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it still super expensive for the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, like modern times
comparatively, how were the seed prices
[SPEAKER_01]: back then when you first flew over?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have to save forever?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the funny part about it is,
is that seed prices, like when you look in
[SPEAKER_00]: those old catalogs, yes, like in all
honesty, you know, you see a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: for 50 bucks, 80 bucks, 150 bucks,
200 bucks, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to realize the way money works
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just give you guys for an example of
inflation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1994, when I turned 18, $20 back then
would be worth $38 today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seed prices have stayed amazingly
stable over the decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't jumped because if you think
about it, if you were selling seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: what Neville was selling seeds for,
most seed packs should be between $200 to
[SPEAKER_00]: $400.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just even to equate how much actual money
Neville was getting for selling those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, they've stayed pretty
stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously there's some people,
there's cookies, there's some,
[SPEAKER_00]: when Skittles came out, there's some
people that really profited off people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People's availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they've charged,
you know, 500, 800, a thousand dollars a
[SPEAKER_00]: pack for certain beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, seed prices for most
things, like if you buy stuff from CSI or
[SPEAKER_00]: you buy stuff from Riot or you,
you know, other good breeders that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we like, like Shaw and different
people, they're amazingly competitively
[SPEAKER_00]: priced, you know, to today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of like the, that was kind
of a long-winded way to basically say this
[SPEAKER_00]: hour or some change or however long we
decide to shoot the shit is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: about like maybe giving some people some
information about how Neville got started
[SPEAKER_00]: and how he collected things and then how
he started blending things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how those things sort of became
like the bedrock of modern cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he's the guy that really took it
from very few hands, relatively speaking,
[SPEAKER_00]: to crowdsourcing it, if you will,
to use a modern term where all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_00]: a ton of people had access to it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that would have happened
without Neville and some others and
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that's sort of the, that's sort
of the beginning and we can kind of walk
[SPEAKER_00]: it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Matt right now is holding up the first
actual real seed catalog, which has a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of cool pictures of Neville's
Afghanistan trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's holding a bunch of his
sheesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's hanging out with people in the tribal
regions of Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so basically when Neville
first started, he didn't know shit of what
[SPEAKER_00]: he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really didn't, he didn't know anything
that he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just collecting stuff from people,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was starting to blend to those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say it probably took him about
three years or so of fucking around,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, 85, 84, 85, 86, going into 87 before
he really started to figure out like what
[SPEAKER_00]: he had and favorites of what he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kind of like 88, 89, 90,
um, that really, when like the blends
[SPEAKER_00]: started happening that, that got made
really famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you look in, um, if you look in
the book, the very first book,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, in the Northern lights,
Greg and those guys sent him like Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: lights labeled one through eight,
but he, you weren't able to buy NL one
[SPEAKER_00]: from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't buy NL two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't buy NL anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bought a random assortment of NL.
[SPEAKER_00]: That he had because he hadn't had time to
like, you know, he inbred those things
[SPEAKER_00]: line by line, but it took them a few years
to really figure out what he had or then
[SPEAKER_00]: grow rooms of the stuff and even see what
was in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to realize too, that like to him,
these are just names that are coming in
[SPEAKER_00]: from these different growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, we have a lot of knowledge
about what these things are supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be, you know, but he didn't have any.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the first couple of years,
there was a bunch of, there was a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in, for lack of a better term,
you know, there's random Nepalese by
[SPEAKER_00]: skunks, you know, Colombians by this
African too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there, there was just a bunch of
stuff because he was sort of reselling,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, everything, you know, everything that
he had, and he didn't really have,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, he didn't really have a way to
differentiate that, you know, so he was
[SPEAKER_00]: just experimenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see a lot of weird things in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a page, um, you know,
he, yeah, he's got some, some tie by,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, by, uh, Afghani, you know,
New Mexico, Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had stuff that you'd never see again,
like skunk one by, by NL nine,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, or NL eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he had Mazar Mazari that he got from
his travels to Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had Nepalese, um, Ruth or Alice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of just a grab bag in the
beginning of just whatever, whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he was kind of collecting from
all these different breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so, uh, you know, they,
um, you know, and, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and also just to go back for a
second, just to give people an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was collecting all that,
uh, Greg McGreg, uh, Seattle Greg sent
[SPEAKER_00]: him, uh, I believe NL one through eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, according to Neville, um, and Greg
and, uh, you know, who people,
[SPEAKER_00]: David Watson, who people call Sam's skunk
man, he had gotten in trouble a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he took a bunch of seed stock from
himself, uh, and then some, from some
[SPEAKER_00]: other breeders and he brought that to
Holland and he ended up selling it to,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Neville, uh, he ended up selling it
to, uh, the owner of positronics,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, Wernard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wernard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wernard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Positron the owner of positronics,
Wernard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he ended up just basically,
you know, he had a couple of kids or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was kind of brokeish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he ended up going out there and he
gave Neville skunk one and Hayes from him
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he was friends with Mel Frank and
Mel Frank had given him Afghani one and
[SPEAKER_00]: Durbin poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then another breeder in the Bay
who we don't know his name had given,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, some, some other Afghans and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so 85, 86 Neville was basically just
reselling a bunch of stuff that he was
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting a bunch of different breeders
that he had gotten in touch with people
[SPEAKER_00]: who had flown out from America to Holland
or had reached out to him through his
[SPEAKER_00]: advertisement like Greg did and started
making connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so that's kind of like the,
that's kind of the, um, that's kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I would, I've been talking for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if Matt, if you want to throw
in, uh, any comments onto that,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if we want to start back and forthing
on some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's, let's start pointing over
some of the baselines that came out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: seed bank here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the baselines that we see in a lot
of modern cannabis lines today.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we'll start, uh, maybe we'll
start with, uh, something simple like
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, if you look in the 85 catalog
and you look in the 86 blog, I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even the 87, but my memory fails me
slightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you really can just buy Northern
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one says cannabis Indica Northern
lights in the 86 and in 87, it just says
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis Indica Northern lights as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just says Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he got it in the, he placed that ad in
84.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got the seed sometime in 84.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, we're not exactly sure when he
started growing them out and he started
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping the lines separate and
interbreeding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you guys send to the podcast
with Greg McAllister, uh, Seattle Greg,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we like to call him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, he basically said that
like, you know, the NL one and the NL two
[SPEAKER_00]: and the NL three, um, those were all
pretty predominantly Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were rated by height and length of
flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then most of the other, most of the
other NLs were those couple Afghans,
[SPEAKER_00]: either one or two blended with basically
every Sativa they could get their hands
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiians, um, you know, uh, Colombians
ties, Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really a hodgepodge and Greg has
mentioned that they were really scared to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and they were really scared to like
lay out exactly what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of those lines are kind of lost
to time in terms of what their exact
[SPEAKER_00]: makeup is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, because those guys didn't even want to
keep track.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just trying to find good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them is a mystery, but if you
look in those first few catalogs,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said before, you can find,
you know, uh, skunk one by NL,
[SPEAKER_00]: NL nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find, um, you know, five by eight,
if you will, uh, you can find a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he started reading them together and
combining them, you know, in various,
[SPEAKER_00]: in various different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in the beginning, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, everybody's familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are familiar with what he
ended up using, which is one of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that became pretty famous, which is NL
five by NL two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the first year he offered it,
he reversed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, and he, and it was NL two by NL
five, uh, because he hadn't really decided
[SPEAKER_00]: yet on like what, you know, what worked
for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after a few years of fucking around
with NL, he basically realized that,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, NL one bred pretty true to itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty close to what we call Steve
Murphy Afghan, uh, which is basically the
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani that sort of got the NL,
uh, line on its way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got these Afghan seeds from this guy
named Steve Murphy, uh, who wrote a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis books in the mid seventies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was sort of a wide leafed short
squat kind of bubble-like, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: lowland Afghan, leafy, frosty,
resinous, short, uh, quick flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: thick, dense, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the NL two was, um, you know,
more of a Kush type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had thinner leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one thing that people should know is
like Afghanistan has an enormous amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: height variation depending on where you
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the stuff like the Mazars and
some of the regions might only be like one
[SPEAKER_00]: or 2000 feet above sea level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when you get up into like the
Hindu Kush region, the Hindu Kush region
[SPEAKER_00]: is the second highest mountain range next
to the Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a bunch of those Afghan farmers were
growing at like 6,000, 8,000 feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: these big tall valleys in the middle of
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those leaves were kind of much
skinnier, much thinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, think about like everybody's pretty
familiar probably with like the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: like what modern Kush looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like that skinny three leaf,
um, you know, with different nugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, where like the lowland Afghans were
sort of like thick feathery, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: dense, denser, looser, more, more leafy
nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Matt's holding up in the picture
right there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's 89.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it 89?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first catalog, Matt, where all of a
sudden he had figured out which NLs really
[SPEAKER_00]: worked for him, which ones were stable,
which ones gave him good breeding work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after getting all those NLs,
all the NLs pretty much disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Neville's catalogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for he offered NL1 F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: He offered NL2 F3.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then he found, he grew up a bunch
of five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since five is so famous, maybe we'll
chat about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this dude named Kirby who,
uh, um, who took Steve Murphy's Afghan and
[SPEAKER_00]: he crossed that to a Hawaiian,
which he saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said was a Colombian by Mexican,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, and he gave that to
Greg and Greg sent that seed line out as
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the one through eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Neville grew a bunch of that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously if you're growing a bunch of
Afghan by Colombian by Mexican,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get a bunch of,
uh, a variety and chaos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he found this one, maybe if you want to
show that one NL5 pick again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let me find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the first few years,
he grew up a bunch of this NL5 and most of
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a chaotic mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Afghani sativa blend all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that picture that you guys are seeing
on the left, he found this one,
[SPEAKER_00]: he called it like a throwback plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he found this one plant that was
almost pure Afghan, super frosty,
[SPEAKER_00]: super resinous, didn't taste like much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super low turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it, uh, it had great structure and
had a great buzz and, uh, he loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think by 88, 89, 90, the only
thing that Neville was really breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: with was you could buy NL1, you could buy
NL2 and he had one cut that Matt just
[SPEAKER_00]: showed of the NL5, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to realize for a second that in
America, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have Neville's NL5 cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent Neville a cut of their favorite,
but theirs was a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Theirs was that blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an F1 hybrid of Steve Murphy Afghan
by Colombian and Mexican, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so, you know, there was,
there's a lot of confusion about NL5 and
[SPEAKER_00]: we have this thing that we call pre-pre
where a lot of people like to,
[SPEAKER_00]: like to talk about how they have seeds or
they have cuts like from the earliest
[SPEAKER_00]: possible time you could have the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people need to, people need to
understand that there was always,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, there was a North American cut of NL5
that was an Afghani hybrid of,
[SPEAKER_00]: with Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a cut that Neville found
amongst the seed line that is that picture
[SPEAKER_00]: right there that looks super Afghan and
super frosty, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, by 88, 89, almost all the NL
you're going to get is he used NL1 and NL2
[SPEAKER_00]: as males and NL5 was always the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: After three, four years of breeding with
NL, he had decided that most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativa, most of the hybrids that were with
Sativa that Greg had sent were a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: mess and hard to breed with and didn't
breed consistently, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to realize too that back then
during the high prohibition times,
[SPEAKER_00]: people wanted consistent producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to joke that if he gave you some
kind of white hot fire, but it yielded 10%
[SPEAKER_00]: less, you'd be pissed.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most, he found that like most pure
Afghans didn't cross very well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they liked being crossed with,
that was one of the, he was one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: first people that really realized that
when you start crossing things and start
[SPEAKER_00]: getting really neat stuff, when you start
crossing things that are totally unrelated
[SPEAKER_00]: to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so the NL that everybody became famous
with, people should realize there never
[SPEAKER_00]: was an NL5 line that was ever released
pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super important as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we see that all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: People popping up with NL5 saying they
have the NL5 cut or NL5 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the NL5 cut that was made
famous because people were buying millions
[SPEAKER_00]: of dollars worth of hybrids of it really,
that was in Europe, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, Greg has stated that by the
late eighties, they had all gotten busted
[SPEAKER_00]: and lost all their shit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't really share very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg told us that they had shared the
eight, a cut of the eight, a cut of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nine and the few friends they had shared
the five cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that wasn't the super Afghani five cut
that Neville shows in those pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the F1 hybrid that was Colombian,
Mexican, and Afghan, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, everything that Neville sold was
an NL5 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had NL5 by NL2.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had NL5 by Skunk1.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had NL5 by Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, can you think of any more,
Matt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as far as NL5 process, NL5 Hayes,
NL5 by 2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's, what was the other one?
[SPEAKER_00]: NL5 by 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are probably three most common,
right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people are talking
about having pure NL5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that'd be really fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Greg says that they lost it all by
the late eighties and then Neville never
[SPEAKER_00]: sold pure NL5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and by pure, uh, to be clear,
he grew out a lot of the seeds that Greg
[SPEAKER_00]: sent him and most of the NL5 wine was a
mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he found this one Afghani plant he
liked a lot and that's the one he used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you know, you see a lot of stuff,
you know, I see some comments,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uh, talking about Bodhi stuff
and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's tough because I'm not here to
like, you know, call anybody out or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or obviously there's a lot of people
making a lot of claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, you know, that's part of the
issue and that's part of the reason why we
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to do these podcasts and these
talks is because most of the history is
[SPEAKER_00]: oral, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's not written down very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, even the people that were there
disagree exactly on what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some consensus, but there's also,
uh, there's also some disagreement and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these old timers, they don't like
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have beefs and they have disagreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not very different than
today, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's breeders today that don't like
each other and they have beefs with each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 20 years from now, there'll be legends
about both, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll be like, Oh, I thought Matt
Riot was a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a fucking this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe him at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there'll be other people will be
like, well, Matt Riot story was consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: in this other guy's story wasn't
inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people aren't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're trying to do with this
is just kind of lay out some like basic
[SPEAKER_00]: facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, I can actually comment on
the Bodhi, uh, and all five thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I was, we were talking during that
time a lot, you know, we've been close
[SPEAKER_01]: friends for a long time and in his goal
with the NL five note, he knew that NL
[SPEAKER_01]: five was never released pure as a seed
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we were trying to find something
closest that we could find.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, he was trying to find it
and, and consulting all his friends to
[SPEAKER_01]: say, Hey, where do you think the best NL
five seed line would be?
[SPEAKER_01]: They would show the best representation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time there was like Dr. Atomic
Northern lights, um, which was a supposed
[SPEAKER_01]: claimant to the NL five, you know,
uh, lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was BCC, which was the more
popular one that had, had been around
[SPEAKER_01]: probably accepted as, as closer to
Northern lights than most that was
[SPEAKER_01]: available at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what he went with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I agree, it was probably one of
the better options at the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: but as far as a pure NL five seed line,
when you break it down, it's, that's
[SPEAKER_01]: really hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it never, because the only people
that had it, you know, and by pure,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's be clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The initial NL five seed line was an
unstabilized poly hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a mixture of Mexican, Colombian
and, and Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was never stabilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was never pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never bred, it never bred true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a full on poly hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Squirrel mentioned the NL five skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned, I think Neville sold NL five
by two and L five by skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, by Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, but NL was always the NL was
always the mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure most people know this,
but I'll say it anyway, just in case is
[SPEAKER_00]: that the way we talk about seeds is the
mother should always come first and the
[SPEAKER_00]: father should always come second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk about five by two.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's using the mother of NL five and a dad
of NL two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some people get it flipped around and
that's hella confusing because it is
[SPEAKER_00]: important to know what's the mom and
what's the dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really helps to have consistent
terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're chatting about seeds,
um, what about the new cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's things where it's
like, I can't, you know, when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about kind of seed history and
stuff like that, this is all stuff that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in the eighties and the early
nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, you know, these,
these things get legendary status and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they pop up in different generations and
by different people and different seed
[SPEAKER_00]: companies in Holland, different seed
companies in later in Canada, they start,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, they start popping out and,
um, I can answer that one actually real
[SPEAKER_00]: quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, there's, there's somebody asking
question about NL five seed from Todd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we know quite a bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the basic story is that Greg says,
okay, that he found that they found some
[SPEAKER_00]: seed from him that he didn't know existed
for decades, uh, after his sister had
[SPEAKER_00]: sadly passed away in her fridge,
in her freezer, in her freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave some of those to Todd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Matt got some of those as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, um, so those, you know,
it's, it's hard to say, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg admitted that, uh, Greg admitted that
he lost everything for decades and then he
[SPEAKER_00]: finds some seeds in his sister and his
deceased sister's, uh, fridge,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that were labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at best you can say that the
provenance of them is uncertain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it's just uncertain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just no way to tell if it is an L
five, then it would be Steve Murphy,
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghan by Mexican Columbia, which,
which originally Greg referred to as a
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaiian, but later on he said what the
Hawaiian was that was actually over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Hawaiian, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, obviously Hawaii doesn't
have any native weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of Hawaiian was sativas from other
traditional regions brought to Hawaii and
[SPEAKER_00]: grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how did BC seed company obtain NL
five?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of jumping around for a
minute, but let's be clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, most of the seed companies in
Amsterdam, once they realized how
[SPEAKER_00]: profitable this seed shit was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would buy seed from whoever had the
seed in Holland, rename it and resell it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, a company bought
Neville's NL two F three and they renamed
[SPEAKER_00]: it Oasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, which company is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt remind me, uh, Dutch passion,
Dutch passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dutch passion, you know, uh,
when this is jumping ahead a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, within a year of Shanti
releasing white widow or other things,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was two or three other competing
seed companies in Holland, selling white
[SPEAKER_00]: widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would just take this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would just lift the exact lineage
from the people that's that first sold the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd buy five or 10 or 20 or however
many packs of seed from that person,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow them out, pick a male and a female
and start making and packaging their own
[SPEAKER_00]: seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it was money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they get them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these things are just reworked,
you know, and one thing that we should
[SPEAKER_00]: also know is, uh, seeds have always been
shady and everybody involved in seeds has
[SPEAKER_00]: always been shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's already always been underground
and it, uh, you know, it's always been
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat persecuted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, a lot of the characters
to be perfectly honest lie and it's hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell what they lie about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the provenance of a breeder is
only as good as what they can prove,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and a lot of people don't demand
that proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know to demand that proof or,
or have it even researched to demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I saw something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to some questions here and just,
we'll go through like a little question
[SPEAKER_00]: and answer session.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, shortly here or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not, we won't get through it all
today, but I just kind of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys can see, I mean, I haven't even
gotten, I haven't even talked to you about
[SPEAKER_00]: the most famous hybrid of all time,
which is NL five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but there's a lot of depth to these
stories on how these people got started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, you know, and then other people
should also know that like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, some of these later seed companies,
uh, a lot of these people worked for
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Adam, who was part of starting THC
seeds, Tony, who was first at cerebral and
[SPEAKER_00]: then made his own sag Martha's seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simon, who was also at cerebral and then
made serious seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they all work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within a year of leaving,
working for Neville or leaving,
[SPEAKER_00]: working for Sensi under Neville,
to be more accurate, they all had their
[SPEAKER_00]: own seed companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's highly likely that at the very
least they took some stock, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: some other plants, some fathers,
some whatever from their previous job and
[SPEAKER_00]: renamed stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I mean, that's the game, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's always been a meaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been get, get something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's never been, um, you know,
but maybe I should take a step back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk for a few more minutes and then
we can answer some questions and then we
[SPEAKER_02]: can get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other part that's cool is that one
of the things that Neville did that other
[SPEAKER_00]: people didn't is that he actually went to
America on some even clone hunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, there's a dude who has written,
most people probably know exactly who this
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he's one of the people through his
books that taught me how to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this dude named Jorge Cervantes
and, uh, Neville met up with Jorge
[SPEAKER_00]: Cervantes on one of his trips back into
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, Jorge got, had new breeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe breeders is the wrong word.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew growers at the very least.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew growers in the Pacific Northwest
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jorge hooked them up with the G13 cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what, what became known as the Pacific
Northwest Hash Plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so certain people gave Neville a
bunch of seed lines, but then there was
[SPEAKER_00]: things like the Pacific Northwest Hash
Plant, the G13, um, you know, stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that that ended up just being straight
cuts that he purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, um, you know, yeah, George wasn't
somebody, he used to go by a different pen
[SPEAKER_00]: name, um, back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but, uh, yeah, he, he hooked up
Neville with those two cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really all we know is that Neville
paid $500 for the G13 cut and it came out
[SPEAKER_00]: of order.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, I don't know how much he paid for
the Pacific Northwest Hash Plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but he paid for that and he sent both
those things back as cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, he kind of collected
over the first five or six years he was in
[SPEAKER_00]: business through some travels,
uh, to Afghanistan from meeting up with
[SPEAKER_00]: American breeders, uh, to going to,
to going to America and buying cuts and
[SPEAKER_00]: seed lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't talked about that, but there
was this, uh, very mysterious character
[SPEAKER_00]: named Jim Ortega that gave him seed lines
that became super famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The garlic bud, the Hawaiian indica,
the, um, the maple leaf indica,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and, uh, uh, the Kush four,
uh, you know, and those ends up a number
[SPEAKER_00]: of those in a bunch of Neville projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so Neville kind of like, Neville kind
of like was able to, in that five year
[SPEAKER_00]: period, you know, or six year period,
really 84 to 90, he was constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting stuff from breeders,
collecting stuff from people, blending it
[SPEAKER_00]: together, releasing stuff, playing around
with stuff and seeing what the hell it was
[SPEAKER_00]: is kind of how it got started in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you want to add any of that shit,
Matt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, actually this, this is harkening back
to people were asking about the BCC
[SPEAKER_01]: company and their sourcing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually found something in reference to
just that real quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is the Dr. Atomic one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be the hemp BCC bank,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't really give an exact,
um, anything on how they sourced it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it does say, uh, this state of the art
indica as a result over 20 years of
[SPEAKER_01]: selected inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pretty much took Neville's
description.
[SPEAKER_01]: The buds have extremely frosted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they actually sold an NL five
Hawaiian indica, NL five Hayes one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaiian Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it didn't say anything about
the sourcing of their NL five and they
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't have possibly been around for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot to digest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of gives you like a super
general overview of like what,
[SPEAKER_00]: what Neville was up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, some of the people he was
collecting from and some of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that he got, um, maybe we'll pause for a
second and we'll hop over to the votes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, people are, and I'll, we'll answer
some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll read them off to you so you don't
have to read them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I got them in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this app that I downloaded works
pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question that got a bunch of
votes is, uh, getting CSI on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, CSI is, I could probably safely say
he's a good friend of both mine and
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we both, uh, chat with him,
uh, fairly often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, he, uh, we're, we're all
good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's certainly possible that we could
convince him to come on one of these in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's not quite, he's not quite as
talkative as Matt and I am, and he's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little, uh, but he has done it in the past
and it is entirely possible that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: get him to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he's a wealth of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, people call him inspector for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he's got a really curious mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: He pokes and pokes and pokes and tries to
figure out knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like the rest of us, everything I
just said, um, that I rambled on about for
[SPEAKER_00]: forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's, it's the result literally of
years of talking to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, years of researching years of,
you know, uh, Matt got to talk to Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit in Oh nine, uh, 10,
12 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or so it got a bunch of emails and
various kinds of communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there was a couple of years and a year
period on, uh, Mr. Nice forums,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is Shanti Baba's site where Neville
was actively posting and answering a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of people's questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's friends of his that have
contributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's enemies of his that have,
uh, their own various stories and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, all this stuff is not easy to
find.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in any one location.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all sort of a conglomeration of,
uh, you know, it's still a lot of,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of work and, you know, CSI,
[SPEAKER_00]: he puts a lot of, he cares about history.
[SPEAKER_00]: He cares about, um, knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he cares about the oral history.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say when, but we can try to get,
uh, homie on here and see if he wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: chat about various things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question is we have, like I said
before, we have no idea who passed the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific Northwest Hash Plant to Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know that Jorge arranged?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jorge did arrange that, that exchange for
the PNW Hash Plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's not public knowledge who gave
it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just know it came out of the Oregon,
Washington state area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there was, there was a group of
growers that, that Jorge knew that he was
[SPEAKER_00]: able to hook up with Neville and Neville
bought them from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, their names are not known to
my knowledge, uh, whoever they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, the Maui cut that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the third, that question and the next
question, what seeds did I buy in 94?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I find anything decent?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Maui cut are both related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was dumb and I was 18 and in
retrospect, I went there and I bought a
[SPEAKER_00]: ton of seed, but sadly I only bought one
or two packs of like 15 different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and not realizing at the time that I
would have been better off buying say two
[SPEAKER_00]: or three or four things, like five or six
or seven packs of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and actually like 20 or 30 or 40
females of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: One instead, you know, I bought a bunch of
random shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought stuff from Sensi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I bought some stuff from, um,
I'm trying to think now, uh, this,
[SPEAKER_00]: the easiest way to put it is, uh,
I didn't find anything that was worthwhile
[SPEAKER_00]: on that trip except for, I was at the gray
area coffee shop and I was smoking a joint
[SPEAKER_00]: and we were young and this old timer was
sitting down next to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, an old timer in the sense that
he probably looks something like me right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was probably in his mid forties,
a little old gray, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we were smoking and we were young
and we were all 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there with some friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were like all 18 to 20 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were all hippies dead head this
mission device, seek seeds and smuggle
[SPEAKER_00]: them back so we could grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a, I had, I had a huge scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a two lighter, uh, at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really major, major player and,
uh, um, I was sitting down next to him,
[SPEAKER_00]: this, this old guy smoking weed and we
were telling him our story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me that he was from Hawaii and
he'd lived there since the mid seventies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every few years he came out and traded
seeds with some of these guys in Holland,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and brought them back and tried them
in Hawaii on Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't a very long conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drank a cappuccino.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't ask him that many questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked a couple of joints together and
a little hash or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end of it, he was like,
well, I'm super stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kids are out here trying to find some
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, why don't you take,
why don't you try a little bit of what I
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he put a handful of seeds in my,
um, and one of those became the Maui cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I stupidly didn't make any seeds,
uh, that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't even attempting to breed yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just trying to find a good female to
fill my two lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I didn't ask him any intelligent
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: About it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I called the Maui because that's
the island that came from, and that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: only thing I know about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, uh, the first time I went to
Amsterdam, I went to Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably two or three times between 94 and
Oh three, probably two or three times a
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to like three cannabis cups in that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I would go, mostly I would go in
summer, um, but I would go, I'd try to get
[SPEAKER_00]: to go a couple of times a year and buy
different seeds, talk to breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to various people, learn as much as I
could.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to realize back then there was
no forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was just in books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Information was pretty hard to come by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, information was rudimentary
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, the way that information flows
now, I wish that I could have listened to
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody like this to shoot the shit about
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but it was pretty hard to come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, the only thing I found on my 94
trip and I kept for the gift, everything I
[SPEAKER_00]: bought was, I don't want to say it was
bunk, uh, but my 18, my 18 year old,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, knowledge, I didn't keep any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I still have that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still grown in Mendocino County by
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great outdoor plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a bunch of might be in some popular
strains that are around nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is definitely in some popular strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, so yeah, I got,
um, the first, the first trip,
[SPEAKER_00]: the only thing I found that was useful was
a gift from a man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked a couple of joints with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably spent a total of 20 minutes
with him, drank a cappuccino, got a
[SPEAKER_00]: handful of seeds in my Palm, smuggled it
back, called it the Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that cut is 27 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, uh, it's certainly my longest old
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had it my entire adult life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it, uh, paid a lot of bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought it with me when I moved from
Chicago to Mendocino County in 1998.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spread it out a little bit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's, uh, it's been in a number of
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I bred with it quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I gave some hybrid,
um, hybrids that I had made, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: of Superdog, which is another story that
we've talked about before, but Superdog by
[SPEAKER_00]: Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave a bunch of that to Mandelbrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mandelbrot, uh, found a thing,
you know, in that, that he called the
[SPEAKER_00]: truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then he bred with it and some of
his own lines and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, she exists in various,
she still exists pure with me and some
[SPEAKER_00]: friends, but she also exists in some other
people's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, she might exist in some pretty things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that's kind of how cannabis is,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, how long have we been talking,
Matt?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right about an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I got an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to do a giveaway tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think probably since we're touching on
the PNW hash plant, I'll give away some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds to the person who asked the
question that got the most upvotes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whoever Billy is, send me a Instagram
message.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's mostly some of the PNW hash plant
crossed a blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there's a couple more questions I
could answer for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, we'll, uh, I can chat a few
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, our friend, uh, Flanville,
he said, what's my personal favorite clone
[SPEAKER_00]: or line to come from Nevel's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the line is easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I, I personally think the most famous,
uh, hybrid ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made in the most festival cannabis hybrid
that's ever been sold is North lights five
[SPEAKER_00]: by Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it's, uh, yeah, I don't think
there's another, there's another line
[SPEAKER_00]: that's more famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're looking at, um, at the
catalogs right there, right out there on
[SPEAKER_00]: top in the 1990 catalog, that's that
picture of NL five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we know which one it was eight?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: A five, two, a five, two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the mother of Nevel's hate that
picture right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the mother of Nevel's Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that cut is still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's both in Europe and it's floating
around with a select few people in
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, you know, it was found in 89 or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's super old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and look at all that leaf resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, basically, um, you know,
he got, you know, it's kind of long,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he got Hayes from, uh, Sam's Dave,
Dave Watson's Sam skunk man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he ended up crossing it with some of
his Indica's, um, maple leaf Indica,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, called that silver Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He crossed it with G 13 and you had G 13
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He crossed it with NL five that became,
and the NL five, uh, I actually don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think there's another line as well as me
thinking that it's the most famous and
[SPEAKER_00]: well-known line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's another line that
has as many named elites that still exist
[SPEAKER_00]: as that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be hard pressed to find one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably four to six, at least
famous named cuts in Europe, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are NL five Hayes, the PIF,
the Heights Hayes, the Cuban black Hayes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dog shit, the church, uh, all those
are all NL five Hayes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they all come from 88 to 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another picture from Sensi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it is, uh, it's probably the most,
it's probably the most famous line that
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone has ever made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's literally eight to 10 to 12
cuts of it that are all have different
[SPEAKER_00]: names that are all elites that are all
still hoarded, uh, and exist on both in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe and in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's by far the most famous
cannabis hybrid ever made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, since you have this beautiful one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's super skunk since he sees
today is sadly probably bunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Neville worked for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole story in itself,
but Neville worked for them after he got
[SPEAKER_00]: busted and got up, they bailed him out of
jail and they gave him a great deal of if
[SPEAKER_00]: we bail you out of jail, you have to sell
us your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, he spent like, he, he spent a good
chunk of time in jail and they bailed him
[SPEAKER_00]: out and Sensi seeds ended up absorbing,
uh, the seed bank from Neville and hired
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville as their top breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville went from owning the biggest,
most successful seed company to having the
[SPEAKER_00]: DA after him spending about eight or nine
months in jail, and then having to go from
[SPEAKER_00]: being an owner to being the head breeder
for different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that's another story,
but they ended up renaming a bunch of his
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so Sensi, for the first five years
in the nineties, for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that was where Neville resided and
made most of his beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably from 95 to 2000, they still
had the vast majority of the original,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, lines that they were working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, seed laws changed in 99 in 2000 in
Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the original breeders got
raided and busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Ben and Alan drunkers are,
um, Dutch businessman for lack of a better
[SPEAKER_00]: term.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will never admit that they lost a
single plant from the originals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get a word out of them that
anything is different than, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's ever been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but most likely they lost a bunch of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm correct, I think they farmed
out most of their work to Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't made the traditional versions
of their seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, the, the timeline I always go by
is roughly 2005, 2006 is going to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: last time you want to buy stuff from the
majority of the Dutch seed banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause by then Nirvana fucking all of them
greenhouse, uh, Sensi, they were all
[SPEAKER_01]: farming out to Buddha seeds and eventually
to Lamota.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then see, sadly since he had about a,
a 10 to 15 year run of having a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: legitimate stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that there could be some things
in Sensi that are still real.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no idea what to know what,
and we do know, um, that they lost,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, quite a few mother plants and breeding
plants over the years, but they'll never
[SPEAKER_00]: admit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sadly no longer what they were in the
nineties, which was an excellent place to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a bunch of beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I will say, uh, see if people want to
see what original Hayes is like Seedman
[SPEAKER_01]: still has original Hayes that they sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe, uh, it's all, it's all
purchased from Watson, if I'm correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if, you know, people talk about,
you know, I might have a cutting of
[SPEAKER_01]: original Hayes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still around in seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, so yeah, there's,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, we could talk endlessly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, there's a couple things on here
that are, they're easy to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said did Skunkva head down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use your headband cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yes and no, I have two headband cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one of them we call the LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does not have that one, but there's
another headband cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely nice, uh, that both him
and, um, ICC, uh, uh, uh, both have and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, Mr. Bob Hemphill and some other people
have, it's much more of a Kush based
[SPEAKER_00]: headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the headband that, that he
uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's a great cut, super potent,
very flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one that I use as well from
elite cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, let's see, uh, you mentioned
the NL five seed line was composed of
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani, Colombian and Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes this different than Skunk one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk one is Afghani, Mexican and
Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's totally different types of
parents, totally different lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, it's like saying somebody's
Italian, Irish, and Chinese, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not the same parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's just the same region of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, certainly Sam Skunkman was not using
the NL Cruz Afghans in his lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's very unlikely that the
Mexican or the Colombians are related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it just goes to show how,
um, different blends, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: from different parents can lead to very
different things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vastly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vastly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, let's see, somebody asked
about, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've been talking the whole time
and Matt has been unusually quiet while I
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I learned, I still learn when we talk,
there's certain things that you said
[SPEAKER_01]: tonight that I couldn't fucking remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, even, even from being the one who
talked to Greg a bunch, I still couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: remember some of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, uh, which, which, which,
do you know which, uh, kind of headband
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb's using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me, let me ask this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a guy that was talking about
where can one find real old school strains
[SPEAKER_00]: and genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are all these pollen chukers with
watered down herm genetics and trash gear
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the most attention?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple of comments on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, for one thing, um, and this is common,
this isn't just for weed, but um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some people are really good at
marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, for lack of a better term,
you know, you know, there's a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's all throw it out there again,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we get CSI on here, in my opinion,
CSI is one of the absolute best breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: that's alive today and working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he, the amount of breeding he
does, the amount that he shows his own
[SPEAKER_00]: work, the amount that he constantly cracks
entire rooms of seed that he has made and
[SPEAKER_00]: shows people what's in the seed lines
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost nobody does that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, almost nobody shows as much of his own
work in pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just watch him grow after grow
after grow after grow after grow after
[SPEAKER_00]: grow on IG for years, just posting tons
and tons of pics of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: most breeders don't test their own work.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this particular time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing your own work is time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to make money as a breeder is
to make the cross, give it a killer name,
[SPEAKER_00]: make some amazing page packaging,
and then be like Masonic or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like pump, pump, pump, pump on IG and
try to get a bunch of hype going,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and growing it out and testing it
takes time, money, energy, space,
[SPEAKER_00]: power bills, you know, all this different
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, no, but the reason why I
mentioned CSI is because he is absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible at promoting himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a phenomenal breed that doesn't
really self promote the way other,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and so you got to separate
marketing from talent, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I should say about that is
that when people talk about herm genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: people act like herms are a bad thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and they're not, you know,
I said this on the live when Matt and I
[SPEAKER_00]: were chatting before anybody that thinks
that herms are bad is tripping.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herms are inconvenient in today's
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, obviously having seeds and stuff like
that isn't the greatest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, uh, herms are just a genetic
trait that enable a plant to create seed
[SPEAKER_00]: in the event that something weird happens
and they don't get pollinated in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a breeding perspective, um,
they're quite convenient to the marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, from a seedless perspective,
where we're trying to grow, since Amalia
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, you know, however you want to
call it seedless, they're inconvenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, but the marijuana plant did not
develop with the idea that it was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be seedless to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedless is a failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A straight failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's trying to just like all
other life, it's trying to reproduce and
[SPEAKER_00]: survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just to be clear too,
there is a lot of the best cannabis out
[SPEAKER_00]: there that's bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really humbling as a breeder that
some of the best on the planet is
[SPEAKER_00]: accidents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sure is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chem dog came from a bag of weed
bought at a dead show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without seeds in that bag of weed,
we don't have chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour diesel was a multi-term accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The super skunk that everybody's hunting
after and everybody wants and everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: claiming to have RKS and there's RKS
coming out of the woodwork and everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to claim like they got skunk,
skunk, skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant hermed like a mofa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hermed like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because it hermed like crazy,
if it didn't herm, there would be no sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be sour diesel is from
accidental harms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why people have Kush,
the reason why Kush came to LA is because
[SPEAKER_00]: in Florida somebody's room hermed and they
sold seeded weed and people found that
[SPEAKER_00]: seeded weed and they grew up some seed and
they got what we know as Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour diesel.
Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You name it, they're bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, a lot of people like,
you know, jump on herms and obviously you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to buy a bunch of gear that has
tons of herms because it's inconvenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But herms are a genetic trait like
anything else and they exist and breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: do the best they can to reduce the
incidence of herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're breeding something,
okay, nobody, you know, nobody cared that
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel hermed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fire wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasted great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got you super fucking high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lasted a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burned great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Kush came from a herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies came from a herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the backbone cannabis and a
lot of the absolute most famous lines were
[SPEAKER_00]: not created intentionally at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were accidents that happened in
people's rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that doesn't mean that like you
want to get a bunch of hermy gear that
[SPEAKER_00]: sucks and makes your life crappy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, herms are inconvenient and
breeders can do the best they can to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce her hermaphrodism traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's, I mean, Matt can speak to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's populations like Thai and other
things where herms are like prevalent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it really depends on which line
you're running.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it vastly depends on the room that the
parents were acclimated in that made the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're popping seeds from a grower that
only predominantly make seeds indoors and
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to run them all outdoors,
probably not the best idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's acclimation, climate,
all that goes into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But intersex traits are here.
[SPEAKER_01]: People look right against them for ever
since people have been breeding cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: furs in Camilla, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're still here and they're not
going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a part of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, man, there's a lot of
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to answer a couple more before we
leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last question is Caleb using the other
headband cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb is CSI and CSI has both of my
headband cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, he's a real good friend of
mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trust him with my whole library.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can have anything he wants from me,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love his breeding work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, nobody put the Mendo perps,
which I got lucky enough to crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody put more genetics out there of the
Mendo perps and made it a permanent part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the gene pool more than CSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has both of my headband cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: My LA cut is a sort of a diesel type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more of a blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the other one is much more of a
Kush varietal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both in my kind of top five or 10
cuts that I possess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has both.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hasn't had them forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he has started using them in various
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can buy some of that work as we
speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Nice, I'll ignore that one just
because it's a super long subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the short version is that after
Neville left Sensei, he started working
[SPEAKER_00]: with Shanti Baba.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they made, they bred together for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the result of that breeding was super
silver haze, mango haze, Neville's haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: some other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Neville was hurting for money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sold Shanti for a good chunk of
loot, a quarter of a million dollars or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of his seed collection from the seed
bank era in the 80s, unreleased stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: various lines and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mr. Nice, like a lot of people,
there's some people that believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: Shanti's full of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some people that believe he's a
shady character, that he's a liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's indisputable that Neville gave
him a lot of real parents and Neville gave
[SPEAKER_00]: him or sold him his seed collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not very many people that have
indisputable evidence that they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of access to the old things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, there's no way to verify
what he has and what he doesn't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of debate on what he
has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's disagreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people think he's full of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people think he's got all the white
hot fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The truth is probably somewhere in
between.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure he has some of Neville's old
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure he has a bunch of Neville's old
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to say exactly what he currently
has and what he doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But his provenance and being able to
access it, I don't think is in dispute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you agree with that, Matt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Neville, I mean, at the very end,
it's not talked about a lot, but he felt
[SPEAKER_01]: like Shanty Babble might owe him some more
money, even though he wasn't in the
[SPEAKER_01]: agreement because he had done so well with
Neville's line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Neville obviously felt that his lines
were being used correctly and making tons
[SPEAKER_01]: of money with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another thing about Australian
bastard cannabis at CSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just say that real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that much about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, CSI is a true breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is really interested in freaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really interested in genetic
oddities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if nothing else, ABC is extremely odd
in the way that its leaves form and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a lot of stuff right now is
really bottlenecked.
[SPEAKER_00]: People use the same 30, 40, 50 cuts over
and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at the very least, when you buy ABC
work, you're getting something that is
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically unique so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's certainly widening the gene pool
of available cannabis by making it
[SPEAKER_00]: available to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is probably one of the first lines in a
long time that's totally unique from what
[SPEAKER_00]: came before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's valuable just for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an ongoing project that he's
putting a bunch of time into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure over the next three or four
or five years, we'll see a bunch more work
[SPEAKER_00]: from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt can comment on this too, but he's
really just been getting started with his
[SPEAKER_00]: own work on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see so many people get so mad every time
he posts pictures of people actually
[SPEAKER_01]: genuinely get hurt fillings when they see
this plant and they're like, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is that piece of shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's surprising to me because a
lot of them claim to be breeders or seed
[SPEAKER_01]: makers and have companies, but they don't
see the genetic novelty in bringing in
[SPEAKER_01]: something completely new that hasn't
really touched cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as modern life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of,
like I said, there's a lot of sameness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say this quickly too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way the breeding has gone the last 20
years, as soon as something becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: famous, everybody crosses it to everything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the amount of shit right now that has
cookie in it, Kush in it, sour diesel in
[SPEAKER_00]: it, Skittles in it, you know, you name it
in it, stuff gets bread and bread and
[SPEAKER_00]: bread and bread and bread to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to take say cookies and to cross it
with ABC is crossing it to a vastly
[SPEAKER_00]: different gene pool than anybody else is
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so who knows what might come of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows in a few years where that might
lead, that might lead to unique highs that
[SPEAKER_00]: might open up the gene pool and make
things pop out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not expecting genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people get on them about it because
it's so weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's really just in the infancy of
playing around with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've seen that he is, you know,
he's been posting a bunch of pictures this
[SPEAKER_00]: last week of some of his work with the
ABC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, we probably,
how long have we been talking?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at about hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe, you know, I don't know if
you guys could like, this is probably odd
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've been talking 98% of the time
for an hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hear it in my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we kind of wanted to just do this
thing and maybe we'll do it like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, semi often or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had this thought of kind of going
through the seed banks and it's such a big
[SPEAKER_00]: subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really only touched on a little bit of
the history.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't really touch on Hayes or Skunk
or Durbin or anything from Jim Ortega very
[SPEAKER_00]: much, but those can be for future things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know if this is where we
want to leave it, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is perfect, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe this is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, if that's the case,
I hope everybody enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't want to make it a
forever thing, but we could do this pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: often and certainly look through the
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe, maybe if your question doesn't
get answered, don't despair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it'll give us an idea for a topic
that we'll talk about on the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just if we didn't get to your question
or you didn't see it happen, doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: it won't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could always ask it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or who knows, you might even hear us
talking about it on the next one because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a good question and it just didn't
pop up on the flow of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to Breeder Syndicate Patreon
where me and Nato always shoot the shit
[SPEAKER_01]: with a bunch of people that are a part of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can ask questions all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whenever we have time, we go in there
and pick at them and try to break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really true, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on Discord and we have a server
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you can directly message me on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it takes me a minute because I
do do things and get busy or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Matt and I are both pretty active on
there and we do bullshit a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot easier to ask away and get
responses on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel free to join that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what all Matt and I are trying
to do at this point is just get chunks of
[SPEAKER_00]: history and chunks of knowledge out there
to the larger public.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of our weed life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we like to do is what we like
to talk about, you know, and pontificate
[SPEAKER_00]: on or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope everybody enjoyed it and learned
a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope it continues and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everyone, for showing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever Billy is who asked that question,
they got the most upvotes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me a message and I'll send you some
PNW hash plant blue bonnet that's
[SPEAKER_01]: unreleased.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Nato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good chatting.
Thank you.
