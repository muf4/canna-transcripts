[SPEAKER_00]: Next would be bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of experience with a lot of
other bubblegums in the seed line,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this specific clone I didn't get until
a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an amazing breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This specific cup that CSI and PIP and all
those guys use came by 1995 from the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was bought the same year that
it won the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what goes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a selection from series seed to
bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bummer for me, it's a great breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fairly potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say it's up there with the best
of the best, but it's got a good little
[SPEAKER_01]: punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: The disappointing thing about it to me is
that it smells very strongly of bubblegum
[SPEAKER_01]: turps, but the flavor does not translate
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get any.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't.
