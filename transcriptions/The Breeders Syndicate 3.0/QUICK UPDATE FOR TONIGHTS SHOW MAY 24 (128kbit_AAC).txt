[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_01]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_01]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_01]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_01]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tonight's show, this is going to be the
second week in a row that we have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: some stupid dance where, like,
we air it live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, well, I'm going to intentionally
take it down after just so the crybaby
[SPEAKER_00]: scammers don't report it that we talk
about tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have the Vimeo, whatever it's
called, links up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The audio podcast forums will,
of course, be up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you need video for context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, other than that, like,
it was kind of funny to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see phylos pop up like a turd
in a punch bowl, hiding behind other
[SPEAKER_00]: scammer websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to keep playing
whack-a-mole with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, yeah, I hope you guys enjoy the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just kind of like a little
pre-announcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, if you want to watch it,
watch it live with all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear the commentary or whatever in
chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or see the commentary in chat as we
discuss some of the goings on during it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably have a Discord chat after.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'll put up the Vimeo link in
the description for the audio version,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, so that you'll still have the
ability to watch the full thing because
[SPEAKER_00]: they have a lot more trouble reporting it
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pussies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Want to sit at the table with the
Syndicate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out our Patreon in our link tree or
description below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our merch site is officially live.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have all sorts of shirts, hoodies,
and goodies to sort you out, and shipping
[SPEAKER_01]: is super fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most importantly, the quality is
top-notch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been saving old designs for years for
this purpose, so please check it out,
[SPEAKER_01]: syndicategear.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have an underground Syndicate
Discord where we get together and solve
[SPEAKER_01]: old, strained history together daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an amazing community of learning away
from IG, and it's an amazing resource for
[SPEAKER_01]: old catalogs and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope you join our union of breeders and
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come check it out.
Thank you.
