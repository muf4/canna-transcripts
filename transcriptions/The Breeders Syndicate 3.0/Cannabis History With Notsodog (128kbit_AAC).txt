[SPEAKER_02]: When the sun comes out and the moon lights
the sky, I am there, surging into the
shadows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ready, go!
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so I wanted to welcome Natsudog,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very good friend of ours,
probably one of the oldest members of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Candle Illuminati.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has an amazing history in cannabis and
I really think it's about time that be
[SPEAKER_00]: shared with the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for starters, let's talk about what
got you into growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What got me into growing was pretty
simple, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was two factors, mostly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I got into smoking weed,
there was really two kinds of cannabis you
[SPEAKER_04]: had access to.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was brown Mexican, which was about
$20.80, and there was green Mexican,
[SPEAKER_04]: which was about $30.80.
[SPEAKER_04]: And anything else beyond that was
incredibly hard to find and expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, eventually, I realized that in
order for me to be able to have a
[SPEAKER_04]: consistent supply, I had to start growing
it even on a small scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you first started growing,
what were the strains that were around,
[SPEAKER_00]: other than the green Mexican and that,
were there any strains around that were
[SPEAKER_00]: floating that were popular to be grown at
that time?
[SPEAKER_04]: So my story is a little different than
most in the sense that I knew one person
[SPEAKER_04]: that grew weed in terms of what we called
kind bud back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was no community, there was no
access.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no Internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, you're growing in a police
state where the laws are extremely strict
[SPEAKER_04]: and heavily enforced.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think about maybe three people
even knew what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I got this strain from Carbondale,
Illinois, from an old deadhead friend of
[SPEAKER_04]: mine that was called the Crystal Chunk,
which I know nothing about other than the
[SPEAKER_04]: name.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was really what got me started in
growing was just that one little strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the only places that we knew how
to get good weed on occasion, you would
[SPEAKER_04]: find it here and there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was basically either going to dead
shows or that was really the only
[SPEAKER_04]: consistent place that we knew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chicago was super dry and the demand far
outstripped the supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't really, you know, I didn't
know anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know how to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: My one friend that knew how to grow,
he didn't even tell me that he grew until
[SPEAKER_04]: he was about to move to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he gave me clones right before he
left.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I bought three books.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought Rob Clark's Marijuana Botany.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I bought Ed Rosenthal and Mel Frank's
Growing Guide.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I bought Jorge Cervantes's Guide to
Indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I read those religiously because that
was literally my only source of figuring
[SPEAKER_04]: out what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Marijuana Botany has been a key book
for a lot of older breeders and people
[SPEAKER_00]: very serious about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty awesome that that was one of
the first books you picked up and were
[SPEAKER_00]: able to read religiously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that could have gone a lot
different had you been growing later and
[SPEAKER_00]: read like Three Pounds of Light,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, you know, I'd like to say
that I had some discerning like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, taste and I just literally
bought all three of the books that were
[SPEAKER_04]: available in like the independent
bookstore that were growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those were the three that existed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I kind of just lucked out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't very many books.
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't very much information back
then about how to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was late 1993, early 1994.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, you're talking pre-internet,
pre-anything really, there was really high
[SPEAKER_04]: times and these very few books.
[SPEAKER_00]: And high times was predominantly Cocaine
Magazine going back and looking at stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, you know, now being an
experienced grower, like I would shudder
[SPEAKER_04]: to read a bunch of those articles and have
anybody like take those as like gospel.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I was young and ignorant
and had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I wasn't around back in the
80s and early 90s, going back and
[SPEAKER_00]: revisiting some of those old magazines
have been some of the biggest treasure
[SPEAKER_00]: troves to finding old lost, maybe not
lost, but forgotten information that isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: currently in the isn't isn't circling the
interwebs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, even even later on with like
overgrown cannabis world and stuff like
[SPEAKER_04]: that, any cannabis source, in my opinion,
does have a whole bunch of tidbits out
[SPEAKER_04]: there that are interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you really have to have a pretty good
base of knowledge to sort through what's
[SPEAKER_04]: crap and what's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so really, that's kind of actually
what started my quest for knowledge is
[SPEAKER_04]: that and who knows if I would have had a
buddy that would have been like here,
[SPEAKER_04]: here's how you set up six lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is everything you buy.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is how you run it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what you do that wasn't available
to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the only way that I could figure out
what I was doing was by learning and
[SPEAKER_04]: searching and trying to find every bit of
information I could to try to figure out
[SPEAKER_04]: how to how to make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so we're going to jump over Mendo
perps for this second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I want to do this is
because I want to go over why you chose
[SPEAKER_00]: the name not so dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in order to do that, I think we have
to you want to visit the the name first or
[SPEAKER_00]: the Kim dog story first or Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's your choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that actually, yeah, that that
that launches five years into the future
[SPEAKER_04]: from that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I grew in Chicago from ninety four
to ninety eight, and then I shifted out to
[SPEAKER_04]: Mendocino County, California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where all those stories that
you just talked about start to pick up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, I don't know which one you
want to start with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either one is fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the Mendo perps is probably the
easier one to start with because it led to
[SPEAKER_04]: the other.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was I was living in and I had some
friends of mine from a dead tour.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the reason that I ended up in
Mendocino County was I had a landing spot
[SPEAKER_04]: in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so one of them was a glass blower,
which at the time was, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: really just starting to spread.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there was a core of like bobsnod
grass and a bunch of other people in
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon and various hippies and people
connected to the dead started to take up
[SPEAKER_04]: blowing glass pipes as, you know,
sort of the new way to smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it was kind of the end
thing to have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so one of my friends learned how to do
it and was, you know, but back then,
[SPEAKER_04]: the tech was pretty poor.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people were fuming gold and
silver and stuff and heated glass and
[SPEAKER_04]: they'd stick a fan in their window.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he bought this literally.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't actually it's sad in the sense
that some of the earliest guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they have lung damage and stuff
like that from breathing and heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not having proper ventilation and,
you know, air removal systems and stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: like that to stay healthy while they're
working, just like any other new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when we first started blowing B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: using a fucking a water bottle,
coffee filter and an open fucking blasting
[SPEAKER_00]: little pan, you know, in a garage close.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, if you if you were to blow B
.H.O.
[SPEAKER_04]: back then and you use PVC pipes and then
you realize that if you stuck your finger
[SPEAKER_04]: on the inside of the PVC, it would end up
being all rough inside and pockmarked.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and then nobody had any idea
about how purging or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I mean, you know, every every era,
I mean, even like in the in the dab era
[SPEAKER_04]: that started, people used to like smoke
off like cherry red bangers that were
[SPEAKER_04]: seven, eight hundred degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That obviously, like once you learn that's
carcinogenic and not good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, that's kind of like when you
trailblaze on anything, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, everybody learns off the back of
others that came before them and use their
[SPEAKER_04]: knowledge spreads and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, in the 90s, obviously,
before the Internet really exploded,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, knowledge was hard to come by.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, like basically like the
the ways that I got knowledge,
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew people on Dead Tour that grew weed
and I would pick their brains.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would go to Amsterdam and I would and
that's a whole nother movie that we could
[SPEAKER_04]: talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would try to pick their brains.
[SPEAKER_04]: As much as possible and how to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Mendocino County being the
southern part of the Emerald Triangle had
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of old time growers and a lot one of
the few places in America that really had
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, deep cannabis history at that
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by moving here, I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so anyway, my buddy buys this piece of
property and he wants to set up like he
[SPEAKER_04]: has some money and he wants to actually
set up a healthy way to blow glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we got this old guy who was in his
50s at the time, 60s right in that era.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was a retired HVAC installer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he knew all about how to set up the,
you know, the ventilation and how to get
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know, a constant 14 miles an
hour of air blow away from the from the,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, from the torch and all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the time, the lady I was with,
it was part of the reason why I moved out
[SPEAKER_04]: here actually is because we were battling,
she had cervical cancer and she was going
[SPEAKER_04]: through all this chemotherapy and all this
stuff in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cannabis really helped her reduce her
vomiting and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a whole long story.
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically they passed 215 in November
of 1996.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it came into effect in 1997.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we moved out permanently and very
early 1998.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I felt bad for this guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was battling cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing as my, my girl was at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was kind of older.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was broke.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I gave him like a quarter pound of
weed and some hash to help with his
[SPEAKER_04]: chemotherapy treatments and stuff,
because it really had made a massive
[SPEAKER_04]: impact on like controlling the nausea for
the treatments.
[SPEAKER_04]: For my girl at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he didn't have any money.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was kind of embarrassed to take it,
but I insisted, I mean, obviously weed was
[SPEAKER_04]: worth a lot more than, you know,
this was before the green rush or before
[SPEAKER_04]: it was still essentially illegal,
even though these laws had just passed,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he, you know, but I just gave it to
him, you know, and I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: look, man, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if it helps you, it helps you,
you know, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need any money.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to feel guilty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just take it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he kept us, he kept helping us set
up this system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then one of the visits he brought me
this little like empty pill bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in that pill bottle, it had a couple
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, you know, I used to grow
quite a bit in the seventies and eighties
[SPEAKER_04]: before the helicopters came in hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, I don't have any money or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't grow anymore, but maybe you could
find something in these seeds that you'd
[SPEAKER_04]: like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I dug them out of my closet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't think very much of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thanked him or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I grew them up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, both of them popped.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I got one male and one
female.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I grew them up to about three feet tall
and I was getting ready to take cuttings
[SPEAKER_04]: off of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, back then it was like, you know,
there was a lot of bedroom grows back
[SPEAKER_04]: then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I was, I was taking, in this three
bedroom house I had, I was going to
[SPEAKER_04]: convert one of these bedrooms into a
slightly larger veg and mom area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had a buddy help me build it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we built this room out, got it all
situated and we moved all the plants in
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the next morning I go in there and he
had missed a stud on one of the,
[SPEAKER_04]: one of the wood hooks and this old school
heavy metal white had fallen from the hook
[SPEAKER_04]: and swung down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it had chopped off the male of
the base.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can only imagine the horror as you walk
in and see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, at the time, you know,
yeah, it was like the, the light was
[SPEAKER_04]: hanging vertically and just shining
against the wall, all super bright.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the time I was super, I was stoked
because at least it killed the boy,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, not the girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and so, I mean, I didn't even,
you know, and then anyway, so I take
[SPEAKER_04]: cuttings off this thing and I flower it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, if you've seen pictures of
it, obviously the Mendo purple is a,
[SPEAKER_04]: is a royal purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a crazy smell that's pretty
unique to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I had this weed of it, you know,
a few months later and I flipped out
[SPEAKER_04]: because I'd never ever seen anything like
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to insert something here where
we kind of explain to modern growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: even as recent as eight, seven or eight
years ago, purples were still very,
[SPEAKER_00]: not common to come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still a trait people were trying to
breed for.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't a lot of true breeding
purples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to find something that was so black,
so beautiful, so purple and bred true for
[SPEAKER_00]: those traits was something really unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is, this is even before,
I mean, in 1990, this is years before at
[SPEAKER_04]: this point, any of the granddaddy purple,
purple Urkel, you know, any, any of those
[SPEAKER_04]: ones that kind of came in like the early
to mid 2000s wave.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is still four or five, six years
before any of that even really began even
[SPEAKER_04]: remotely to spread out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I mean, literally like
purple weed back then was like hearing
[SPEAKER_04]: stories of purple haze or something that
you'd never seen or there was,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was some Indica's, you know,
in Mendo that if it got cold in the late
[SPEAKER_04]: season, they would turn purple,
but that was cold induced, not natural,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and this thing turned you know,
royal purple and climate controlled mid
[SPEAKER_04]: seventies grow room.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was pretty much a shocker to be
perfectly honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, it was really a shocker.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was in my early twenties at the time
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so I bring this weed to, to this,
to this gentleman and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: he, he totally thought he gave me
different weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like, Oh my God, I haven't seen
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I only grew that one year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I grew it in 1977 in Kovalo up in the
Hills.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now people that aren't from Mendo might
not know, but Kovalo is basically a little
[SPEAKER_04]: Indian reservation in the middle of
nowhere really tucked away.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a beautiful Valley, but it's super
remote in the late seventies.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was probably even more remote.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so at the time that was 1998.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then I realized that the seeds that I
had popped were 21 year old seeds and I
[SPEAKER_04]: was 22 at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was, it was, it was kind of a trip
and in that regard and you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like a lot of old timers, I mean,
he, he, you know, that's what he
[SPEAKER_04]: remembered about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he only remembered the year because he
only grew that strain one year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically he must've found a couple of
seeds and some buds through him in a,
[SPEAKER_04]: in a, you know, a pill bottle and stuffed
it in his closet and forgot about it for a
[SPEAKER_04]: few decades, you know, so it was literally
like a time capsule to the late,
[SPEAKER_04]: to the late seventies, you know,
and actually to the early influx of the
[SPEAKER_04]: first Afghanis hitting the U S yeah,
right in that, right in that same era,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, he, he passed away from
his illness, which is a shame.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I never really, I was never really
able to get much more information other
[SPEAKER_04]: than the year and the location that he
grew it and all that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so obviously like after I, after I
realized what it was, I was super bummed
[SPEAKER_04]: that I didn't have the mail because at
that time I would have crossed it to
[SPEAKER_04]: itself and everything and had a whole
line, you know, and all that type of
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But be that as it may, I, you know,
I, I passed out the female to very various
[SPEAKER_04]: good friends and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, she survived.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what's interesting about her is
that I think she's unique in terms of her
[SPEAKER_04]: terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing else I've ever smelled
that smells like her.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's just interesting in the sense
of, you know, you go through different
[SPEAKER_04]: eras, just like now, you know,
everyone's searching for skunk,
[SPEAKER_04]: which used to be a super common terpene in
the eighties and nineties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now is like a unicorn, whatever the
Mendo perp smells like, however you'd like
[SPEAKER_04]: to describe it, it's not something that's
survived in other modern cannabis strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe it wasn't unique at the time,
but it's certainly unique now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it does have, according to
Humboldt CSI, it's, he said that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% show skunky terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I, I got, I, you know,
he, he's done more positive work with it
[SPEAKER_04]: than anyone probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've gotten to go up and look at rooms
full of S1s that he's done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it certainly is a genetic that has a
wide variety of, of stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we joke that like, you could give a
few hundred S1 seeds out and various
[SPEAKER_04]: people could make their own unique lines
completely based off what selections they
[SPEAKER_04]: picked.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's, there's black ones
where the buds are all black and the
[SPEAKER_04]: leaves are black.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's burgundy ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's ones where the, it's very dark
purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a wide variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's every shade of purple from
lavender to dark, dark black to almost a
[SPEAKER_04]: burgundy or a maroon.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's ones that have pine soul aromas.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's ones that have a bit of Kush or a
bit of skunk, um, tall ones, short ones,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, decent amount of hermaphrodism in
there at various points.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, sometimes when you ask one
stuff, it kind of is what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's a fairly narrow gene pool,
but she's got a pretty wide gene pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that combined with the fact that
she's fairly low THC leads me to believe
[SPEAKER_04]: that she's probably like an unworked,
um, initial land race from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, because most cannabis back then was
between seven and 15% THC at best,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, with the hermaphrodita,
hermaphroditism that that's, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't know this or understand this,
but in land races and even specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanis, when you run land race,
Afghanis, you are going to run into a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that's the way land races work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're unworked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not all, but a good deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and those early Afghanis tended to
have that tendency.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's an interesting thing too,
in the sense that like, I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: hermaphroditism is obviously like a
survival trait, um, that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: allows seeds to be for, you know,
to be created in a different fashion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so for us, you know, since we had
this big push towards seedless,
[SPEAKER_04]: it became one of those things where like,
it's always universally bad in people's
[SPEAKER_04]: opinions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but there's a lot of phenomenal
strains out there that end up being
[SPEAKER_04]: people's favorites that have
hermaphroditism sort of locked into them
[SPEAKER_04]: for better or for worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Train wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Classic examples.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Old super skunk for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, and I actually think that
sometimes, you know, that's a,
[SPEAKER_04]: that can be a discussion for a different
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: We touched on it in the live that we did,
but that, you know, I actually think that
[SPEAKER_04]: some Terps and certain aspects of things
might even be linked traits to
[SPEAKER_04]: hermaphroditism.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that by breeding away from some of
that, everybody assumes that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: guaranteed it's an individual trait that
can be bred out with no harm to any thing
[SPEAKER_04]: else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes that could be true,
but also I think that could be untrue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes there's linked traits that
you might really like that are tied into
[SPEAKER_04]: that hermaphroditism at times.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't learn about linked traits until I
was doing a lot of breeding hands on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't something that I learned about
early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't read about it a lot in cannabis
breeding talks, especially on forums and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot, but linked traits are super
important for people to learn about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's, it basically it's,
it's a considered a Siamese twin type
trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you don't get one without the other
and it passes on as such.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and, and so, you know,
in a lot of regards, it's like
[SPEAKER_04]: hermaphroditism became a bad word because
obviously like with the way that the
[SPEAKER_04]: finances work in cannabis, like getting a
lightly seated room or a heavily seated
[SPEAKER_04]: room could be problematic, you know,
but I mean, there's also this thing where
[SPEAKER_04]: several of the most famous cannabis
families of the last 20 years are
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially based on multiple instances of
hermaphroditism creating a series of
[SPEAKER_04]: things that led to some very famous stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that list, we have OG Kush,
Sour Diesel, Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, a lot of these things were,
you know, they were just, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, people would get, people would end
up with some seeds that came out of their
[SPEAKER_04]: little personal or their little small
scale indoor room, you know, that they
[SPEAKER_04]: would hustle to themselves and friends and
they would save some bag seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that bag seed later on could end
up being some of the more famous strains
[SPEAKER_04]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Sour Diesel was born off
accidental herming, multiple, multiple
[SPEAKER_04]: aspects, multiple rooms at different times
of accidental herms.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cookie was the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's other ones we could talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, GG4 was multiple accidental herms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really humbling as far as trying
to breed where, you know, people put all
[SPEAKER_04]: this, you know, you can put all this
intention and everything else into it and
[SPEAKER_04]: fail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some accidental stuff and a six
lighter ends up changing the face of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be humbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's something people need to
constantly be reminded of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's often overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: People try to add their own stories to
history to make it seem more intentional.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the long run, yeah, it's a lot of
happy accidents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, you know, we, we, again,
we mentioned this in the live,
[SPEAKER_04]: but like one of the reasons that the
actual, you know, what people call the MSS
[SPEAKER_04]: or I call the super skunk or maybe some
people call the skunk six.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the reasons I think why it became,
you know, so hard to find or possibly lost
[SPEAKER_04]: was that, you know, she was, she hermed
live pollen at times early and late,
[SPEAKER_04]: and she could seed a whole room for you,
you know, at the drop of a hat,
[SPEAKER_04]: at the drop of stress or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so people get scared.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get scared of that and they try to
breed away from it or they eliminate a
[SPEAKER_04]: cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, all it would take is one time,
one room seeding heavily and you can't
[SPEAKER_04]: sell it for as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you ditch the cut, you know,
and you don't realize 15 years later that
[SPEAKER_04]: you'd be like searching heavily for that
exact thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times people would eliminate
really good strains because they had a
[SPEAKER_04]: tendency to rot or they had a tendency to
herm or they had a tendency to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was other strains that they
could get as much money for or sell just
[SPEAKER_04]: as easily that didn't have those risky
bits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they would just get rid of it and
not realize later on how important it
[SPEAKER_04]: might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, you know, 20, 30 years later,
we're sifting through a thousand fake MSS
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: As fads happen, you know, I basically feel
like the named clone thing and fads was
[SPEAKER_04]: really detrimental to cannabis in the long
term, in the sense that like in the 90s,
[SPEAKER_04]: that was probably the golden era as far as
diversity because anything that was good,
[SPEAKER_04]: anything that was good quality cannabis
would sell easily, which meant that all
[SPEAKER_04]: these, all these different things that
people had, all these various like family
[SPEAKER_04]: oriented strains that were up in Humboldt,
Mendo, that were grown every year,
[SPEAKER_04]: they were all viable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every time a train wreck or a purple
craze or a sour or a Kush or a cookie or a
[SPEAKER_04]: Skittles or anything like that happened,
literally dozens to hundreds of high
[SPEAKER_04]: quality cannabis strains would get shifted
to the side because they weren't as easy
[SPEAKER_04]: to sell as what was currently easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most people only want to hold on to
whatever is currently easy to move at the
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, I mean, to give a perfect example
in maybe 04, 05, 06, when the purple craze
[SPEAKER_04]: was raging, everyone, and I mean,
just about everyone up here had purple
[SPEAKER_04]: oracle, grape ape, granddaddy purple,
Mendo perps, all these various things,
[SPEAKER_04]: because there was an endless demand with
brokers for as much purple as you could
[SPEAKER_04]: produce, they would take and they would go
quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that led to a whole bunch of stuff
being shifted to the side that was really
[SPEAKER_04]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you fast forward 15 years and how many
people held on to those cultivars?
[SPEAKER_04]: People absolutely are hunting for original
oracle, original GDP, original this,
[SPEAKER_04]: because as soon as it went to sour and
Kush and other things, 98% of the people
[SPEAKER_04]: that had it ditched it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And weirdos like me and Caleb kept working
purples because they're pretty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you laugh at times when people are
like, where's that 2010 era sour diesel?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is pretty late to the sour diesel
game.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for some people, it's like that was
when they actually had access to a real
[SPEAKER_04]: cut and then they lose the cut and they
think they can get it back from someone
[SPEAKER_04]: else and then they can't find that cut
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And realistically, a lot of the times,
specifically with sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, they'd be searching for a cut with
the name sour diesel and they would have
[SPEAKER_00]: already been they would have absolutely
been growing a different cut not related
[SPEAKER_00]: to sour diesel, so they just won't find it
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, sour diesel, you know,
we've talked about it a bunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happens to be one of the more confusing
and extremely difficult families to sort
[SPEAKER_04]: out what cut came when, from who,
where.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even though we know multiple
people that were originally involved and
[SPEAKER_04]: we've gotten the chance to interview them
and pick their brains about stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's still a decent amount of holes and
unknowns.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, the cuts don't there's
certain things where like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the the the chain of of of, you know,
of who had it when is really well
[SPEAKER_04]: established.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with sour, it's a lot more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, that is pretty crazy that
we've been able to talk to the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: first had their hands on the original seed
that was popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still can't quite untangle the
whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not because they're lying,
it's it's not necessarily all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of them are really good
dudes, but it's just a matter of of
[SPEAKER_00]: different perspectives and memories.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that specific one, I don't think
that there was a, you know, obviously
[SPEAKER_04]: there was a seated room and it seems like
even in the very beginning, there was at
[SPEAKER_04]: least two, possibly three sour cuttings
like, you know, popped by different
[SPEAKER_04]: members of that crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to give a quick shout out to
my buddy Crybaby.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's he's the one recording this and
helping us with getting this done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a huge shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has some amazing F2s and open
pollinations available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find him at Crybaby Organics on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give him a shout.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, getting getting back to what we
were talking about a little bit ago,
[SPEAKER_04]: the Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, when we were talking on our
live and I was talking about the history
[SPEAKER_04]: of Super Skunk and in regards to that
specific cut and stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the the my buddy, you know, which I call,
you know, from Staten Island or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: He lived in Sonoma County and I gave him a
joint, a purple of Mendo perps one day,
[SPEAKER_04]: not long after I'd found it and he fell in
love with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he he ended up giving me what people
now call the Chem 90 one and the Super
[SPEAKER_04]: Skunk for that cut, sort of just an
informal trade or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's kind of like the Mendo perps
led me to the chems is basically is the
[SPEAKER_04]: easiest way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that we're touching on that,
let's let's go ahead and do the entrance
[SPEAKER_00]: to the chems, how it all went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we talked about on the live feed,
but there's going to be a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: who only listen to the podcast and are
familiar with the live feed interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go ahead and cover it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give the I'll give the relatively
short version of the story because our
[SPEAKER_04]: buddy Skunk V.A.
[SPEAKER_04]: has had, you know, has has told the story
at great lengths and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Cliff Notes version is that Skunk
V.A., being from Virginia, had some
[SPEAKER_04]: hippies and friends of his and mentors
that were from that area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And him and our our East Coast buddy used
to go and see all the Jerry shows and the
[SPEAKER_04]: Jerry Garcia band shows at the Warfield
basically every time he played.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he our our Staten Island buddy had
this strain called the Francine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Francine was a old indica really
flavorful, prone to rot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of these friends of Skunk V.A.'s
from Virginia flew out and were absolutely
[SPEAKER_04]: in love with this Francine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they told our buddy that if you
bring us the Francine, we'll give you some
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk cuts that we really adore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he at that same time had already made
arrangements with ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, ChemDog had the ChemDog and he
didn't want to pass it out to anyone
[SPEAKER_04]: because he didn't want to get cut off from
his sources or his, you know, he didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: want anybody to have it on the East Coast,
basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But because Dude had moved to Sonoma and
lived on the other side of the country in
[SPEAKER_04]: California, he agreed to give it to him as
long as he didn't share it with anybody
[SPEAKER_04]: back East.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Homie drove the Francine from
California all the way out to Virginia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And traded the Francine for the super
skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: In 1993.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he drove up to Massachusetts and
met ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he got that's where he got what we
call the dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other people call it the Chem 91 or the
ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_04]: He got that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was also the ChemSys back then,
but he didn't like that one very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he didn't end up taking it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had some extras of the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he gifted one to ChemDog before he
drove back home.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he drove back home and brought
the super skunk and the ChemDog out West.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how it ended up in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how skunk VA and myself and IC
collective all got a hold of it was
[SPEAKER_04]: through our buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's the short version of how.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it was basically Jerry shows
hippies liking weed, some informal
[SPEAKER_04]: trading, and it just kind of ended up
where it ended up on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're you said it was 1993 when
it ended up on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was 1993 when it ended up on the West
Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our buddy held on to it for a few
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: When Jerry died in 1995, I believe skunk
VA, like a lot of people stopped traveling
[SPEAKER_04]: and got a home, wasn't on dead tour
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's when he started growing the
super skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he has obviously posted some old
Polaroids on his page, which are amazing
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's visual evidence of that exact
cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then and then he got he got the super
skunk and the ChemDog in the mid 90s from
[SPEAKER_04]: our buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a few years after that,
I met I met those guys and I traded the
[SPEAKER_04]: Mendo perps for those two cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the start of me having them.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and let's talk about how you got your
name.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a little bit more complicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, our Staten Island friend,
he was an early adopter of the don't pass
[SPEAKER_04]: things out, which is unusual because he he
freely traded with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the most part, he really didn't
want things getting out and he really
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't want the ChemDog getting out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you got it from them,
you pretty much had to swear that you
[SPEAKER_04]: weren't going to pass it to anyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for a while, quite a while,
actually, this is like long before the
[SPEAKER_04]: Internet or forums made it famous on any
level.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was really only to my knowledge,
I think there was only about four people
[SPEAKER_04]: that really had it in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there was him, Skunk VA, a guy whose
handle is Icy Collective on Instagram and
[SPEAKER_04]: then myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there was really only like four
grow rooms that really had it in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was some of our favorite herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Staten Island and Skunk VA lived in in
Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_04]: I lived one county north in Mendo and Icy
lived in Tahoe at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so depending on who had the freshest
herb, we would trade amongst each other
[SPEAKER_04]: all the time to make sure that we always
had fresh, you know, fresh ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Staten Island drove up to Tahoe,
the Tahoe dog, not to confuse people with
[SPEAKER_04]: Tahoe OG, but like when the ChemDog was
grown in Tahoe, there really is something
[SPEAKER_04]: about mountain grown herb and the cold,
cold temperatures that you can get up
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed that this in Chicago growing in
winter, if you can bring in five or 10 or
[SPEAKER_04]: 15 degree air into your grow room,
it really makes the plant frost up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like maybe it's a defensive mechanism.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you can bring in bone dry,
bitter, cold air into your room,
[SPEAKER_04]: it definitely causes a reaction in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Icy grew some of the most visually
appealing 91 that you could find.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we would always get fresh batches
from him whenever it came down and we
[SPEAKER_04]: would trade amongst each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Staten Island went up and he got a
couple pounds off of them and drove it
[SPEAKER_04]: back home.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he met me and we were outside of this
little town called Willets in Mendo and it
[SPEAKER_04]: was in the dark and he want I was going to
get some of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he's like, man, he's like,
I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This stuff just looks so different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells a little different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he hands me this turkey bag and I
open it up in the dark and I stick my nose
[SPEAKER_04]: in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, it's not so dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, it's not so dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, I don't think it's the dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not getting the nose that I would
expect.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, it's got to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the only thing he has.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, I stuck my head in it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, no, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got a flashlight out and we
stopped.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started looking at it and it didn't
ended up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it ended up, it was a, um,
he had, uh, mislaid.
[SPEAKER_04]: There'd been some mislabeled cuttings and
he'd kept a mom and he'd filled a room
[SPEAKER_04]: full of cuttings of what he thought was
the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it ended up being this other cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when I was, uh, when I was trying
to, uh, join, uh, when friends of mine
[SPEAKER_04]: were convincing me that I needed to join
Instagram and some other stuff and climb
[SPEAKER_04]: out from under my rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I kept entering names into the thing
and every single thing I could think of
[SPEAKER_04]: was taken, uh, which was got hell
annoying.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just popped that name in as a joke
and low and behold, it wasn't taken,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, uh, it ends, it was kind of like
a, like an inside joke between us,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, because of, yeah, it was, uh,
I'm not even sure what that strain was.
[SPEAKER_04]: To be perfectly honest, cause he only grew
at one time before he got the dog back and
[SPEAKER_04]: got a properly labeled mom again.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's kind of how the not so
dog came to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I absolutely loved that story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, well, can you tell us about super dog?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so that's a little, that's,
that's kind of involved, but, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: basically what it boils down to is that,
um, like I said, Staten Island had the
[SPEAKER_04]: super skunk and the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those were kind of our two favorite
strains, uh, or some of them at least.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, you know, uh, him and I were
doing a bunch of breeding together,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, hobbyist stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, back then, like there was no
intention of ever, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: selling anything like that, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was way long before some of these,
like most of these American seed companies
[SPEAKER_04]: got started.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were just trying to, um, breed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of like the traditional way to
breed, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we were trying to take traits from
two different things and combine them into
[SPEAKER_04]: one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, the super skunk had amazing
Terps and it was lime green and it was
[SPEAKER_04]: frosty and it reeked and it grew tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the chem dog was kind of dark.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of ugly, but it had incredible
potency.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we were trying to see if there was
a way that, uh, we could combine those
[SPEAKER_04]: traits in the same plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he had actually started the project
before I met him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's, it was like one of those things
where you'd laugh at it now where
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody comes out with 20 strains a
year, but this was literally like a four
[SPEAKER_04]: to six year project, um, that we would do
here and there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so he had actually done,
uh, the initial stages of it, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: on his own and he had taken a Hawaiian and
crossed it to the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that was, I think it was,
we brought, it was brought to F3,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe selecting to the skunkiest traits we
could find.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that was, and then a male of that
was hit to the dog, uh, chem 91 and,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, that got labeled super dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and then we hunted through a bunch of
those seeds, um, and found some keepers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there's actually, there's a picture in
the second can of Bible of some buds of
[SPEAKER_04]: it, as well as a bunch of plants,
passed it out to a bunch of friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then, you know, we started doing
this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did some line breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did some open pollination and we
eventually did this huge open pollination,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, where we took like the seven best,
uh, super, super dog males that we found
[SPEAKER_04]: and we hybridize them to everything we
had, which would have been a whole host of
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: My Maui cut that the chem 91, the super
skunk, the warlock, the black Domina,
[SPEAKER_04]: the Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, basically every nice cut we had
access to, we blew off a huge room of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, uh, and yeah, it really was kind
of the best of both worlds, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: in the sense that the super skunk for all
of its legendary status or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: it really only had moderate potency and
the Terps were volatile.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the sense that it smelled like a dead
skunk the last two or three weeks of bloom
[SPEAKER_04]: and maybe the first three or four weeks of
post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you held onto it long enough,
it honestly went a bit generic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, whatever those terp,
it kind of went to a little bit more
[SPEAKER_04]: generic green bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once those Terps faded and the chem dog,
they were actually perfect to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: together because the chem dog took a while
to cure and didn't really reach its
[SPEAKER_04]: quality until about a month after.
[SPEAKER_04]: After you cut it down where the super
skunk was at its best the first month you
[SPEAKER_04]: cut it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you grew the two together,
you could smoke a shit ton of,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, of super skunk, super fresh,
and it would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then by the time the super skunk was
starting to lose a little bit of its
[SPEAKER_04]: luster, the, the dog would be just exactly
perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once the dog hit that perfect point,
it would stay good for months.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, um, and so they were really nice
to grow together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and so we were trying to get the
terpene, uh, and aromas and all that,
[SPEAKER_04]: and some of the stretch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you see those pictures that,
uh, skunk VA has posted, it was stretchy
[SPEAKER_04]: where the chem dog was a little bit more
Afghan, a little bit slower growing,
[SPEAKER_04]: not, not extreme Afghan.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had some stretch too, but not as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we were trying to, we were trying
to figure out a way, can we get the
[SPEAKER_04]: potency of the chem dog, you know,
mixed in with the vigor and the nose and
[SPEAKER_04]: the taste of the skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, it was a hobbyist project in a
sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did it for us and our friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, yeah, we just basically fucked
around with breeding here and there in
[SPEAKER_04]: different rooms and different places over
time, working on it, refining it,
[SPEAKER_04]: passing out various cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: We found a friends and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of how it all got started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first interaction with super dog was
seeing it inside the can of Bible number
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and at that point, you know,
at that point, chem four was circulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D was barely circulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, chem 91 was almost not circulating at
that time, but a few people had it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but G's all was in circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I remember when Bodhi gave that
to me, I thought, wow, this is supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be mass super skunking Chem D and,
and I loved that cut, but I always
[SPEAKER_00]: thought, what would it be like with chem
91?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I saw the super dog inside that
can of Bible, that became one of my white
[SPEAKER_00]: whales, my white whales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it still is, it still is one of my
white whales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I still haven't found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, but that's, that was my first
experience with the super dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing it, looking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I eventually, uh, I think it was a G's all
crossed to the chem dog D DNL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I named that super dog 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a long before we were friends,
but it was just so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when we did meet each other and became
friends to find out, I was friends with
[SPEAKER_00]: the guy who created one of my white wells.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, the farther you go back
in cannabis, it really is kind of a small
[SPEAKER_04]: community, you know, in that regard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, you know, I used to joke that
you're only like three hippies removed
[SPEAKER_04]: from anyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you know, and it's really,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean back, you know, like it really,
it really was like, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, it kind of, now it's spread out and
there's all kinds of people doing it all
[SPEAKER_04]: over the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, back then it was riskier.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was smaller.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was only so many people involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and you know, and on top of that,
like even breeding, I mean, all the
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding that we did essentially was a
labor of love.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there was no profit margin in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no American seed companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no real way to market your
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you were, if you were trying
to, you know, start a seed company,
[SPEAKER_04]: you went to Amsterdam.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And tried to do it over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really it was like, um, all that
breeding was done with intent to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: better weed for our friends and,
you know, and to have it, there wasn't any
[SPEAKER_04]: fame involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't any money involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, it was a money loser because
obviously back then prices for herb were
[SPEAKER_04]: extremely high compared, you know,
uh, and so blowing off even small rooms of
[SPEAKER_04]: seed, um, that you weren't even going to
make any money off of, you were just going
[SPEAKER_04]: to hunt through yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it was basically a labor of love.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there wasn't any, there wasn't
any intent behind it except for to try to,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, grow better weed and be like
this strain and this strain, maybe we can
[SPEAKER_04]: combine them and we can get these traits
to pop out in one strain combined,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of that is missing and this
is just my opinion, but I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: that is missing in today's market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, obviously times have changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to, I mean, you never had
to, but the idea, yeah, it was Americans
[SPEAKER_00]: went over to Amsterdam and they started
their seed companies over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of that has changed to see
prices have gone up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's become a market in itself to sell
seeds to where people are getting rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at DNA, you look at, uh,
you know, at greenhouse, any of those
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that are mostly seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and to this day, you still don't sell
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's very admirable to me,
admirable to me, but I still think you
[SPEAKER_04]: need to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in a sense, like it wasn't so much
that, um, that, you know, I just,
[SPEAKER_04]: it just wasn't even, it just wasn't even
feasible back then really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't seem like it was possible or
yeah, American seed prices were,
[SPEAKER_00]: what, 20 bucks a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you knew someone, something like that,
it was, it was a way different world.
[SPEAKER_04]: To be perfectly honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, while I never thought that way,
my buddy that we did the, that I did the
[SPEAKER_04]: project with, he, he saw what could be
coming and he had this idea that,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, you know, if we made rooms full of
seed, that you could actually produce way
[SPEAKER_04]: more seed in that room than you could ever
produce bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that you could actually do really well
with seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And his intention, uh, at some point was
to flip it around and start selling some
[SPEAKER_04]: seed, but it was really like, it was
really too early.
[SPEAKER_04]: People weren't into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: People didn't want it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We tried to move it to friends and things
like that at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, you know, at that era,
people just wanted dependable clones that
[SPEAKER_04]: would sell for high dollar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they didn't, most people didn't want
to do hunting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, they didn't want to, you know,
they didn't want to put in the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just wanted to get a plant that was
going to work for them and move it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we did a bunch of this stuff and it
was kind of like, I don't want to say it
[SPEAKER_04]: was ahead of its time, but you could just
say that the market perhaps wasn't quite
[SPEAKER_04]: as receptive or ready and that there
wasn't a distribution channel,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, like the internet and stuff like that,
that made it easy to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just doing it because I wanted to
create, um, better weed to smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: For myself and friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but my buddy from Staten Island,
he actually kind of, he did see what was
[SPEAKER_04]: coming, although we were years away from
actually making it work where he realized
[SPEAKER_04]: that like one day, um, you know,
seeds could be extremely popular in
[SPEAKER_04]: America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and that there'd be a demand for them
and that, you know, off a six or an eight
[SPEAKER_04]: or a 10, 10 lighter, you could actually
make way, way more seeds than you could
[SPEAKER_04]: ever make as far as, um, producing flour
for sale or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, uh, but honestly, um,
the world really wasn't ready at that
[SPEAKER_04]: particular moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they, uh, it was really the
height of like certain clones fetch top
[SPEAKER_04]: dollar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the vast majority of your friends
just wanted to run those clones because it
[SPEAKER_04]: was consistent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people didn't want to hunt back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he, he was like, he was a little
ahead of his time in that regard in terms
[SPEAKER_04]: of like what he saw coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never saw that as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but you know, um, I just wanted to
create different things that friends and I
[SPEAKER_04]: enjoyed to smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and so what that led to was that,
um, you know, I, I've never sold beans or
[SPEAKER_04]: anything like that, but I've given a whole
bunch of beans and strains I found from
[SPEAKER_04]: those beans away to close friends and
various people and anybody that I thought
[SPEAKER_04]: had a good heart, uh, as far as,
uh, you know, where they were at with herb
[SPEAKER_04]: and that, um, in retrospect, because I did
that, uh, I went through some struggles,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, and that you go through in cannabis at
times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and the only reason why some of this
stuff exists today is because I passed it
[SPEAKER_04]: out because I personally ended up losing
most of it, uh, through a series of
[SPEAKER_04]: unfortunate events.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Acts of God, police fires, various
different things can occur where you end
[SPEAKER_04]: up, uh, you end up not having what you,
you know, I mean, it's happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happened to all the guys in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it ha it happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happens all the time, you know,
uh, you know, people get in trouble,
[SPEAKER_04]: people get visited, things happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fires happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ex girlfriends get angry at you and trash
your stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, all kinds of, there's all,
there's all kinds of different stories
[SPEAKER_04]: about their, their famous things end up
getting lost, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And part of the problem is, is that if you
hoard things too tightly, then it really
[SPEAKER_04]: narrows, like who has it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, you know, and then, uh,
you know, it can be lost permanently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, that's always the big catch
22 and pickle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, how much do you really trust someone
to give us someone something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: special?
[SPEAKER_00]: How well do you know them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but I mean, the thing is,
is that, you know, back then, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're talking late nineties, early two
thousands.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really was a different era.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, in terms of all that, like nobody was,
it was all still pretty underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody was trying to make a name for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody was trying to become famous off it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, if you were going to do that,
you would end up moving to Amsterdam or
[SPEAKER_04]: something along those lines and trying to
do it on the, on the legal or semi-legal
[SPEAKER_04]: kick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody was really advertising.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all word of mouth and extended
friend groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so, you know, there's, uh,
I had a, we, I had another friend,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, out here at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the early two thousands,
um, he had started to show some interest
[SPEAKER_04]: in breeding, um, and working some stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was, he was from up in Northern
Humboldt and, um, hadn't really done that
[SPEAKER_04]: much before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was, I had done a bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, you know, we had other
interests, we had other shared interests
[SPEAKER_04]: that we had together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we were hanging out and he wanted
to get started.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I ended up giving him a few
thousand seeds of various things that we
[SPEAKER_04]: had made, mostly super dog crosses and
some clones to add to what he already had.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so he could get started and start
playing around with stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, that guy ended up becoming
relatively famous, um, especially,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, after he sadly passed and his name's
Mandelbrot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but if you, anything, um, anything
that he, you know, I'm not, I'll just like
[SPEAKER_04]: pre, you know, preface this by saying that
like, by no means what I'm about to say,
[SPEAKER_04]: am I claiming a bunch of, uh, Mandelbrot's
like mantle or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you look at, um, anything that he
did, if it has chem dog, super skunk,
[SPEAKER_04]: Maui, sour, uh, a few other things,
um, that all came out of seeds that I
[SPEAKER_04]: gifted him, uh, you know, is, is
basically, I gave him a few thousand seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: to get started so he could hunt and play
for things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then out of the, uh, out of the,
the Maui super dog, um, he found that cut
[SPEAKER_04]: called the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, uh, he, you know,
so, I mean, he changed some names and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you see something that says Amherst
super skunk, that's the same super skunk
[SPEAKER_04]: cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, he spelled chem dog instead of DOG,
he spelled the D-A-W-G.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, he took a little artistic
license here and there on, on some of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but anything that you see that in his
stuff that has that as a basis,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, that was all stuff that I gifted him,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then he took those things and bred
with them and crossed them to things that
[SPEAKER_04]: he had, um, and made his whole,
uh, Emerald triangle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Emerald mountain, I think was the
first one that he had.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, he was doing a bunch of stuff up in
Arcata.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, uh, after he died, um,
his brother, who's a super nice guy,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, has tried to continue it with Emerald
mountain legacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's sadly when he died,
um, it seems like, um, I don't know who
[SPEAKER_04]: they are, but a bunch of people seem to
have raided his mom room and seeds and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there was kind of a free for all on
who got his stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of got, it kind of got,
you know, it kind of got a little dicey
[SPEAKER_04]: there or whatever, but, you know,
he left, um, you know, he left four kids
[SPEAKER_04]: behind who were pretty young.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and, um, one of our mutual friends,
obviously, uh, me and Gene, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: did a very successful auction,
uh, to help out the kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, his brother came out to try to
continue on what he'd been doing and help
[SPEAKER_04]: support the family and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, um, you know,
uh, but yeah, so as far as, as far as some
[SPEAKER_04]: of the super dog stuff, um, it ended up
being, you know, it ended up being the
[SPEAKER_04]: basis for a significant percentage of what
Mandelbrot ended up breeding with and
[SPEAKER_04]: using, um, because I supplied not
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, he had some of his own cuts and stuff
like that, certainly, but I supplied a
[SPEAKER_04]: number of cuts and a bunch of seed to get
him started on his breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a lot of what he did got based off
that work that, uh, uh, myself and my
[SPEAKER_04]: buddy from, you know, from Staten Island
did together, you know, and that's kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: like how things were a lot back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, anytime I'm talking about any kind
of breeding project, whether I mentioned
[SPEAKER_04]: them or not, I almost, almost never back
then were you doing something alone in
[SPEAKER_04]: your basement by yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: You always had a buddy who was helping you
or a partner, or you brought the strains
[SPEAKER_04]: and you ended up doing it at a friend's
spare bedroom or, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: there wasn't, back then, nobody cared
about rep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody was trying to have ownership.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were all just trying to like breed on a
certain level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so, you know, um, you know,
most, most cannabis stuff occurs in
[SPEAKER_04]: groups, you know, and that was certainly
true with most of our stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it might as well just be a
helper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it was a full partner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it was someone that like,
let us use a room or a spot on their Hill
[SPEAKER_04]: for a project we wanted type of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so that's how most of that stuff
went down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, unfortunately, you know, um,
you know, uh, you know, Mandelbrot got a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit of a, uh, an ego, um,
about various things and didn't really
[SPEAKER_04]: want to like, once he got a bunch of
credit and a bunch of fame, he didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: really want to, um, you know, he didn't
really want to return certain things that
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd given him after I'd lost them in
various ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that went on for a few years and we
eventually patched it up and he was going
[SPEAKER_04]: to make right on everything and give me
back certain things that I had lost that
[SPEAKER_04]: he still held.
[SPEAKER_04]: But sadly, he, you know, uh, he had a
sudden and unexpected death.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that never really came to fruition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so, uh, through a series of
unfortunate events, myself and,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, my buddy and some others, we all lost
the super dog plants and lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but, uh, they're not totally lost
because tons of people have ran his work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so they exist in that form all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have this mystery cut here called
the truth that may or may not be from him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean that, you know, um, so,
I mean, that's, that's really like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, to me, it's, it's like,
that's, I mean, we've talked about it
[SPEAKER_04]: before, but I have like a few things in
terms of what I think makes you a good
[SPEAKER_04]: breeder or not, you know, let's go over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, I think for, for one thing,
I think the most important part is that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, can your, can your breeding,
can your breeding produce elites?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I mean by elite, I mean,
right now, you know, with Mark modern
[SPEAKER_04]: marketing and stuff like that coming into
cannabis, uh, everybody has elites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody has rare, amazing, fantastic
killer genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the old, in the old days,
what became an elite was like enough
[SPEAKER_04]: growers, enough heads smoked it and
thought it was worthy enough to be
[SPEAKER_04]: something that was highly desirable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how all the old elites became
elites was that not everybody had to agree
[SPEAKER_04]: that it was the bomb, but enough people
agreed that it was the bomb.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was desirable and that it had,
whether it was it's terpenes or it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's potency or it's effect or it's growth
or, you know, some combination thereof.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, that's how, that's how all
the name strains that we like to collect
[SPEAKER_04]: got named and got popular.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, and so there's some
people out there, you know, and so like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I don't even care if your lines
produce a bunch of garbage to be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as it's possible to produce elites
out of your line, you know, because I
[SPEAKER_04]: mean, let's face it, like we're
essentially trying to do, we're
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially looking for LeBron James.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a super model or, you know,
something along those lines, you're
[SPEAKER_04]: looking for a rare combination of traits,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Richard Simmons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and it, and it's like,
so obviously like in the, in the line
[SPEAKER_04]: itself, you're only going to find those
superstars every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise they wouldn't be elite,
you know, when people like say a keeper in
[SPEAKER_04]: every pack, you know, I mean, that to me
just means that like, you could have a
[SPEAKER_04]: high floor, but a low ceiling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where you find something that's reasonably
decent in most packs, but you don't find
[SPEAKER_04]: very much that's, that's, so I would
prefer to have a low floor and a high
[SPEAKER_04]: ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I think that's what Tom Hill went
for too, like with the haze and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, I mean the hazes especially.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the haze, you know, I mean,
obviously, you know, we've talked about
[SPEAKER_04]: this a bunch in private, but like,
there's a reason why there's so many hazes
[SPEAKER_04]: that are 30 plus years old that are still
carefully held onto.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even those guys that had access to
tons of seed, they had to go through a ton
[SPEAKER_04]: to find what they wanted.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and so, you know, it's there's a
bunch of, I don't want to say the word
[SPEAKER_04]: garbage, but there's a bunch of stuff that
you wouldn't pick for yourself because
[SPEAKER_04]: it's too much jungle weed in some of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, I mean, there's certain
seed companies out there that have sold
[SPEAKER_04]: literally millions of dollars in seed and
I, and they don't have, nobody is trading
[SPEAKER_04]: cuts of theirs at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over, you know, decades of selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like every once in a while people
don't find nice things in there that they
[SPEAKER_04]: hold on to, but like, you know,
so it's like, if someone has gone through
[SPEAKER_04]: tons of your work and nothing has popped
up, right, that ends up being that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion, that's kind of a failure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is okay, because it's like,
breeding is mostly failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: For someone with a discerning eye and with
enough experience, it should be mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: failures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes, you know, sometimes you
just don't get what you want most of the
[SPEAKER_04]: time, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of the first thing is like,
you know, like I don't, so for me,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like, I don't really mind if you get
junk or bunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I used to go and I mean,
we could talk about this at different
[SPEAKER_04]: points, but I mean, I would make,
you know, multiple trips a year to
[SPEAKER_04]: Amsterdam and buy a bunch of seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, there's things I bought
from Neville or Sensei or whatever that I
[SPEAKER_04]: never found jack shit that was worth
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then there's other people that in that
exact same line found highly desirable
[SPEAKER_04]: keepers that have been kept alive for a
long ass time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and one of the mistakes that I
made back then was I would go over there
[SPEAKER_04]: and I would buy like two packs of like 15
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: When older me would have been like,
I'm going to go buy two or three things
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm going to buy 50 or 80 seeds of
each thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really try to deep dive.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you go over there, you get all
excited, you know, you're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get this, I'm going to get
this, I'm going to get this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: As well as I do now, like, you know,
it's much better to try to go through 30,
[SPEAKER_04]: 40, 50, 60 females than it would be to get
eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what are your chances of finding a
supermodel or LeBron James and eight
[SPEAKER_04]: females?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, any any geneticist or breeder
would laugh at you if you got that small
[SPEAKER_04]: of a selection pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think most breeders outside of the
cannabis community looking in like
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders that are in agriculture tend to
think what we do and how generally
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking, as far as like seed companies
and whatnot, they think it's silly that we
[SPEAKER_00]: would even consider F1s, F1s nowadays.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I mean, at the same point,
when you're growing corn, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, 50,000 cornstarts aren't going
to get you lifetime in federal prison.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very, very true.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I mean, obviously there's like
the Luther Burbank thing of pick,
[SPEAKER_04]: pick the best and ditch the rest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you have severe legal penalties
in many states that are based specifically
[SPEAKER_04]: on numbers, you know, you know,
genetics is a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I actually think we've been able to
do an amazing amount of positive work in
[SPEAKER_04]: the 90s and early 2000s based on garages
and things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, the second thing I would
think is beyond the ability to throw
[SPEAKER_04]: elites is do other breeders want to take
your work and work with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super, super important to me as a
legacy type thing that that should be what
[SPEAKER_04]: we all strive for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because really, eventually everybody's
going to be forgotten.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, one of the first podcasts you
did, I wonder if you did a poll,
[SPEAKER_04]: how many people even knew who Seattle Greg
was?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, not very many, really,
but he is one of the most important
[SPEAKER_04]: founding people in cannabis in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you know, so everybody gets
forgotten.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, you know, so it's really like,
you know, the thing that won't get
[SPEAKER_04]: forgotten, even if they have no idea who
you are, is that if you improve the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis gene pool, if you create plants
and you create, you know, elites and stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: like that, that other people end up using
and breeding with, then, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you made a lasting contribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the legacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because people might have no idea who he
is, but they're growing NL poly hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: They might not even realize that there's
NL in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they are, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he made a lasting contribution to
the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: That exists for decades after he quit,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, that, you know,
being able to find elites in your stuff is
[SPEAKER_04]: one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two is other people thinking highly enough
of your work to want to use it in their
[SPEAKER_04]: own work and continue on with that stuff,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And three is kind of a silly one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's all ego.
[SPEAKER_04]: But three is if people want to steal your
work and rename it and claim it as their
[SPEAKER_04]: own, then they really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now they want it to be a part of
their legacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would they would like to steal your
legacy and, you know, then make it their
[SPEAKER_04]: own and get the credit and get the fame
and get the whatever from your stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So obviously, if they're trying to do
that, then whether or not they give you
[SPEAKER_04]: the credit or not, they secretly think
quite highly of your work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, and so, I mean,
obviously, like, you know, you were in you
[SPEAKER_04]: were in music for, you know, for a while
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of like breeding is kind of
like the music industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's lots of talent that never
gets recognized.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's lots of talent that never makes
any money.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so if your goal is like is
social recognition and money, most of the
[SPEAKER_04]: time you're going to be disappointed in
that regard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's lots of people that did a ton
of good work.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and lasting impacts that,
you know, we're at.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, look at, you know,
look at look at all the 80s hip hop.
[SPEAKER_04]: None of those guys made any money.
[SPEAKER_04]: But fast forward 15 years and the next
generation of hip hop, some of those guys
[SPEAKER_04]: are worth hundreds of millions of dollars
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so it really is like what era
you came up in, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: Neville probably died pretty broke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely did.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he never really he never really
he never really benefited in that regard,
[SPEAKER_04]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, most of his money went to legal
fees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, he never he didn't end up
like Arjun from the greenhouse where he
[SPEAKER_04]: was worth millions of dollars and had
stable this and investments or anything
[SPEAKER_04]: like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he was enough of a pioneer that he
actually spent chunks of time in jail and
[SPEAKER_04]: had the DEA trying to put him into prison
for the rest of his life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he got over by business partners.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, some of that, obviously,
like, I mean, he had his own personal
[SPEAKER_04]: demons and struggles and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he also is one of the most important
people in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he didn't, you know, he got he got
notoriety and fame based on it,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But because America has this this rename
game where we give nicknames to weed based
[SPEAKER_04]: on cultural stuff, it kind of like a lot
of a lot of stuff that's in Neville's
[SPEAKER_04]: people don't even know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it gets a name like Electric
Boogaloo or it gets a name like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, dumpster or it gets a name like
Piff or it gets a name like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: absolutely, you know, and some of those
things, you know, it gets lost to time
[SPEAKER_04]: what they originally were, you know,
and sometimes those strain names change
[SPEAKER_04]: again based on what crew they go to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that happens a few times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you really have to have a good,
you know, get some luck and some history
[SPEAKER_04]: and some digging to find out like what
what things are, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so all that kind of stuff gets lost to
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, it really is like, breeding is
like what you what you what you add to the
[SPEAKER_04]: gene pool, because then eventually other
people are going to be smoking good weed
[SPEAKER_04]: that you had some small hand in creating
or making better or adding that it gets
[SPEAKER_04]: out there, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, because I, you know,
in that same instance that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I lost some of the I lost my lot,
my superdog lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: I lost the mother cutting of the Mendo P
the Mendo perps for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: But because I shared it, I got it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and, you know, I did some
breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of those things are in some
pretty famous things right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And but I mean, our mutual friend CSI,
I don't think anybody has done more like
[SPEAKER_04]: he's the one that made sure that the Mendo
P and its genetics are permanently in the
[SPEAKER_04]: gene pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's he's bred with it so much and he's
added it to so many different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so many people have bought his seed
lines that he's really the person that
[SPEAKER_04]: made it a permanent addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and he makes a perfect example
of of the difference between, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: someone that's been doing it for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it right every time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not not to say he doesn't have failures,
but he does what a real breeder should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet he's not one of these mega famous,
you know, multi billionaire millionaire
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking Arians.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean, all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's the thing about Ariane is
that like he ended up in a perfect space
[SPEAKER_04]: and time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he really did.
[SPEAKER_04]: There really there really is something to
that where it's like he got Sean T and
[SPEAKER_04]: Neville to form greenhouse with him,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they brought their genetics and
their famous cuts and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, he won.
[SPEAKER_04]: They won a bunch of cups back when,
like the high times coming out of what
[SPEAKER_04]: what was winning cups was like a really
big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and so the amount of Americans
and the amount of people that would go to
[SPEAKER_04]: Amsterdam and go to greenhouse and buy
weed and smoke weed from greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_04]: then buy seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Made him extremely wealthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but he was I mean, he he was the
business side of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that and that's, you know,
that's like a whole other interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: topic of like the and it's happening now
in America, where it's like in the 90s
[SPEAKER_04]: that it's really like you can really learn
a lot from watching what happened in in
[SPEAKER_04]: Amsterdam then where the breeders and the
people with the passion for the plant and
[SPEAKER_04]: all that ended up melding with the money.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and, you know, it wasn't always
the happiest marriage, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously, like, you know,
going, you know, Neville had his seed
[SPEAKER_04]: bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If he doesn't get if he doesn't get caught
up in Operation Green Merchant and spend a
[SPEAKER_04]: year in jail, he probably never partners
with Ben and Alan Tronkers from Sensei
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he would have never sold his stock to
Shanti.
[SPEAKER_04]: He never would have.
[SPEAKER_04]: He never will.
[SPEAKER_04]: He never would have given his stock to
Sensei.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: He went he went he went from owning the
biggest, most successful seed bank in
[SPEAKER_04]: Holland to being the head breeder of
somebody else's seed bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Sensei ended up trademarking a
bunch of the names or even changing a
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch of the names so they could trademark
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he ended up having to sell out to
business people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then lost control of a bunch of his
own genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when Shanti and him went to work
with Arjun, because he learned from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They never let Arjun have any of the moms
or the dads or the seeds or the herb or
[SPEAKER_04]: the cuts.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would they would grow and they would
provide the flour and they would provide
[SPEAKER_04]: the seeds to greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they were very well aware that if they
allowed, you know, if they allowed him to
[SPEAKER_04]: get a hold of it, that he could just cut
them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they probably knew his personality,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because that's that's essentially
what it what happened to, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: Sensei Seeds ended up owning most of
Neville's work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and, you know, and so he didn't
want that to happen again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, there's always been this
push between the people doing the real
[SPEAKER_04]: work and then those people don't tend to
come from money and then the people you
[SPEAKER_04]: have to bond with that actually come from
money and that like that tension there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, there's people in cannabis
that are in it for the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, they want to make a living,
obviously, and be comfortable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, and they have this desire.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's people that are into
monetizing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And their primary interest is monetization
of what they have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we deal with that all the time in
America right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a huge there's a huge push
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing that holds true that I'm
learning is that most of the guys that are
[SPEAKER_00]: in for the monetization, one of their
first moves is to get someone else to make
[SPEAKER_00]: their seeds for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or or just, you know, they have a story of
how they came across the elite stuff that
[SPEAKER_04]: made them famous.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not as good of a marketing story
as they would prefer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they come up with these lies and this
marketing story or they just kind of make
[SPEAKER_04]: it up along the fly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have various forum posts or
various videos of them, different eras
[SPEAKER_04]: where it's hard to keep track of what they
said when.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a small percentage of us that
are, you know, nerd out on that kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff and able are able to piece together
like what was really going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, you know, there was a lot of
years there where a bunch of people buying
[SPEAKER_04]: cookie thought that burner was hand
watering their cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they sure did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they really did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yes, you know, and that's a
testament to Berner's marketing capability
[SPEAKER_04]: and his ability to like, you know,
push fame and push things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I mean, they really like
cookie was cookie was primed to be because
[SPEAKER_04]: it's so visually pretty.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, yeah, it really was perfectly
suited for the Instagram and in that era.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were timing for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they did a really good job of
marketing it and hyping it and pushing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, they they stole names from
Girl Scout cookies and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: thin mint and they use.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I mean, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why that's why the Girl Scout
cookies push back is because sure
[SPEAKER_04]: marketing and brand name recognition.
[SPEAKER_04]: People spend enormous sums.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like developing that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially the Girl Scouts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and so I mean, they,
you know, they that's why they went from
[SPEAKER_04]: Girl Scout cookies just to cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they would have been sued into
oblivion about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, but he they took,
you know, cannabis really wasn't ready for
[SPEAKER_04]: modern marketing techniques.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and so we were super susceptible
to these kind of modern marketing
[SPEAKER_04]: techniques where I mean, you know,
obviously you and I, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you get into a bunch of trouble because
you poke holes in people's bullshit all
[SPEAKER_04]: the time publicly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, you have your method of
doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, I would choose a slightly
different method.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have your method of doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for them, you're attacking their
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what it's like.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't give a flying fuck about the
truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They care about their image and how much
money they're making.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they view it as a drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a direct assault on their pocketbook
and their rep, which is super important to
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're coming at it from a from a
history point of view.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, they're coming at it from a
like, why are you messing with my game?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just marketing, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and they're just trying to make
it in the world and they're just trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: sell their stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, and it's like, you know,
and and they felt like the happy accident
[SPEAKER_04]: or, you know, how many people like claim,
you know, how many people over the years
[SPEAKER_04]: have claimed the origin of a strain just
because they were the first one to,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, get out there and lay claim to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you find out that they were just
gifted it early on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other people that gifted it to
them wanted to remain anonymous.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they realized they didn't have to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then a ton of people end up
associating that with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they end up demanding percentages.
[SPEAKER_04]: If others see breed leaders use their work
or they sell the cut for high dollar or
[SPEAKER_04]: they do all these various different
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they just got they were just in the
first handful of people that got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Decided to market it in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how Katsu's name got attached to
Bubba permanently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone gave him that cut, but he
distributed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he started a company.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, you know, I'm not I'm
not trying to, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily like call out individual
people, but obviously that's super common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's nothing negative on him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that's how people's names
quickly get attached to something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, my buddy, our buddy,
he never he never attempted to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But literally, because Skunk VA was the
first person to get on the forums and
[SPEAKER_04]: start talking about the chem dog
extensively.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a bunch of people that call it the
Skunk VA cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, in Canada, they just released a
line that Canadian health whatever called
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk VA and it's supposed to have chem
dog in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he never he never played that game
of trying to like lay claim and on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, we've obviously with his
with his interviews and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: he's been extremely upfront and honest
about how it all went down.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just because that was his handle on
the forums and he was the one dropping
[SPEAKER_04]: information about it, it got a label
associated with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's when we all amongst our
crew, we all call it the dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That leads to Internet confusion like
nobody's business.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's got to be the Skunk VA cut or it's
got to be the chem 91 or it's got to be
[SPEAKER_04]: the chem dog 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it has to have a label that
makes sense for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it better not have A&W in the middle
of dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, and then, you know,
so but, you know, I mean, that's a thing
[SPEAKER_04]: where it's like he wasn't even he wasn't
even remotely trying to but it still got
[SPEAKER_04]: associated with his name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like just because people needed
a way to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which cut?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the one that Skunk VA has.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and then other people took that,
you know, took different cuts that they
[SPEAKER_04]: had and tried to actually like lay claim,
you know, and then they never thought that
[SPEAKER_04]: information would come out later that
would like put them in a bad light.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then eventually it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're like, oops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're not going to like refund
anybody's money or any of the that they
[SPEAKER_04]: did when like they insisted that you had
to give them X amount of percentage for
[SPEAKER_04]: the right to breed with their cut or to
sell their cut or they just monetize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming to you from the dark, scary,
slimy place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, because it is so important to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's I would say your your
family cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that that that that's a good segue
because the name is horrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's not a good name.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's just in the sense that because
of when I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which was the very early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you know, Kush hadn't wasn't
famous yet at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there was there was I don't think the
TK had even made it to California yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the cut that, you know, Josh D and
those guys brought was only with a couple
[SPEAKER_04]: of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there was only a few rooms in
Southern California that even had it,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out, Resin Lum.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a couple others.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, and so like, you know,
when you talk about Kush now, when I first
[SPEAKER_04]: got on that, when I first got on Instagram
or different things, like everyone would
laugh.
[SPEAKER_04]: And be like, oh, bro, that's not Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want me to show you what Kush like
there was no.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other name for it is
headband.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But headband is is almost as confusing of
another name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and the history behind the
various headbands and what got named
[SPEAKER_04]: headband is right up there with sour as
being not poorly understood, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: not well understood, not not very well
sourced in terms of like, I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: take a step back for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to use it as an example,
we're really blessed in the sense that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, Kim dog pops a seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It becomes what we call the dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gives it to my buddy from Staten
Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude drives it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gives it to gunk VA and I see and
myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's a chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a chain of hands where,
you know, when it was popped by who,
[SPEAKER_04]: who gave it to who, it never got lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of stuff like this isn't very clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we have no idea who first named
headband headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, too many people take claim for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know who the first headband cut
was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't exactly know what the first
headband cut that was named headband was
[SPEAKER_04]: even made up of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even know if it had anything to
do a diesel or Kim, the first.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and so now, I mean, I will say
that, you know, so we can segue into the L
[SPEAKER_04]: .A.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is kind of a funny story is that
when I gave all those clones and all those
[SPEAKER_04]: all, you know, I gave a series of clones
and a few thousand seeds to Mandelbrot and
[SPEAKER_04]: he was just getting into growing and he
had a few things.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had the train wreck and he had a few
different things and he had this sour
[SPEAKER_04]: diesel that was different than the sour
diesel that I had.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we traded.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were supposed to trade sour diesels.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he's like, well, these he only had
like literally I think he had three or
[SPEAKER_04]: four cuts that he was holding on to at
that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he so he's like, I'm going to give you
a couple of these headbands and a couple
[SPEAKER_04]: of these sour diesel cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he brings me four cuts and he's
like, I forgot to label them, but two of
[SPEAKER_04]: them are sour diesel and two of them are
the headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I get these cuts and I label them
all carefully and I mom them up and I take
[SPEAKER_04]: clones off each one of them and I flower
all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and I can't tell them apart for
anything, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It all looks the same to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm bringing friends by my grow room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody can tell them apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and they all just look the same to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, but only two of them are
supposed to be sour and two of them are
[SPEAKER_04]: supposed to be headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my friends are like, this looks
like sour to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, granted, this is a very early 2000s.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sour wasn't even like very well known
then either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was just starting to make its
way on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, sour was popped in what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninety five.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, so this is this is only,
you know, five years after that or
[SPEAKER_04]: something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not very long.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just started to creep around.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't even really become famous for
another five or six years, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so I'm growing this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm bringing everybody by and everyone
like they're like, dude, it kind of looks
[SPEAKER_04]: like similarity or sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: It must be.
[SPEAKER_04]: It must be his different sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because it kind of looks like
yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not exactly yours, but that's got to
be it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I grow it a couple of times and I'm
calling it sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then at that point in time,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, it was it was it was true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the first I think the first 10 years
I knew him, I never saw him like behind
[SPEAKER_04]: the wheel of a car.
[SPEAKER_04]: He always had to have a driver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did he wear costumes to the car?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't do anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was like he he definitely,
you know, everything had to be in somebody
[SPEAKER_04]: else's name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because his name would,
you know, he had some trouble in Montana.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, he didn't want to deal
with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he just kind of, you know,
back then, being a hippie and going in
[SPEAKER_04]: certain circles, you could kind of go
offline and live a lifestyle and never
[SPEAKER_04]: have to pop up on the on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly in the 90s and early 2000s,
before everything got computerized and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything else, it was way easier to do
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So eventually, like for six months or
something, after I got him, I had this
[SPEAKER_04]: room full of what I thought was sour and
he was rolling down from Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, dude, you didn't give me
two different strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: You gave me this one strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never gave me what you're supposed to
give me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, because I can't tell these
things apart for anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I kept all four original of your of
your cuts you gave me.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all moms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have them all labeled different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grow them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all the same shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he comes down and he walks in my room
and he's like, this isn't sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, yeah, this is the headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what we call the L.A.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, it's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I didn't give you my sour,
you know, and he ended up liking the sour
[SPEAKER_04]: that I gave him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Better than the sour that he had.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he was like, I don't even want to give
it to you because honestly, he's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm using yours, not mine, you know,
because yours is nicer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's like, you got you definitely got
the better of the two cuts that I gave
[SPEAKER_04]: you, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, and so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then I was like, fuck, it's the
it's it's headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I'm like, which headband?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, well, it gets called the L.A.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush, but it's really a headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think already, you know, with the name
changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, actually, like he's written
he wrote some articles and stuff like
[SPEAKER_04]: that, where if you go and you look and he
talks about like him breeding and he talks
[SPEAKER_04]: about breeding with the Maui Superdog and
breeding with other various cuts that I
[SPEAKER_04]: gave him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every time he writes about the L.A.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush in parentheses, he'll put headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our original headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because that's what he got it
at.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then in L.A., they called it the L.A.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush, which obviously within a few years
became, you know, nonsensical because the
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush that became famous was significantly
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then it wasn't right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's actually and, you know,
he did some breeding work with that
[SPEAKER_04]: headband cut, and that's that's what
became the 707 headband is the mother of
[SPEAKER_04]: the mother of the 707 headband is that is
that is that cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, he actually passed it out
free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really to various people at times.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was really but it was really
finicky.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it didn't it wasn't as consistent a
producer as the sour diesel that I gave
[SPEAKER_04]: him was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so most people dramatically preferred
the sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I liked the high better of the actual
headband cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is this is years, years
before.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't think the Loompa headband
cut popped up on the scene until like 08
[SPEAKER_04]: or 09 later.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, CSI knows it for sure,
because he's got all the like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like he does.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as inspector style, he's got all the
forum posts archived and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_04]: of when it actually came about.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, even the other even the other
cut that got renamed headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one didn't even start to spread out
until 06 or 07.
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so this one proceeded these
things by, you know, five to nine years in
[SPEAKER_04]: a way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it might be the original
headband cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, you know, because we never
even found out the human that named it
[SPEAKER_04]: headband or who cracked it or.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will say that, you know,
we were talking much earlier about,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, for instance, CSI, you touched
on like why, you know, why he's kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: the gold standard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that he does is he
grows out a ton of his own work.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you grow out a ton of your own
work, you obviously get to see what traits
[SPEAKER_04]: the various plants you have pass on to
their progeny, which if you don't grow
[SPEAKER_04]: your own work, you don't get to see what's
a consistent breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get to see what what what it
throws, how it behaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're just taking two famous
names, mashing them together and offering
[SPEAKER_04]: them to the public.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, one of the things that
the Superdog project did to me was it gave
[SPEAKER_04]: me a really, really good idea of what the
super skunk and what the chem dog do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially crossed, obviously,
but like what they throw and all the
[SPEAKER_04]: various ranges of what they throw.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that like, you know, and so,
you know, I'm pretty convinced that that
[SPEAKER_04]: headband cut has 91 and super skunk in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how, you know, is it,
you know, and we've talked about it,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like, I mean, one of the one of
the people involved in the in the sour
[SPEAKER_04]: diesel story at the very beginning was
Vondo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who we've gone to interview.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, he popped, you know,
he he popped some of those seeds after he
[SPEAKER_04]: moved to Southern California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying that like the headband is
that, but I'm just saying that you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere it, you know, if you grow it and
you grow the sour, it is in the diesel
[SPEAKER_04]: family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would bet almost any amount of money
that how exactly it's in the diesel
[SPEAKER_04]: family, like what exactly it contains.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like I've grown enough of that
stuff out.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're in and sour and 91, you know,
super skunk and 91 hybrids and stuff that
[SPEAKER_04]: it's in there somehow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I in the, you know, 19 years or 18
years or whatever that I've had it,
[SPEAKER_04]: information has been super hard to come
by.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I like, you know, like we said,
even with the sour thing and even getting
[SPEAKER_04]: a bunch of people that were there in the
moment, finding out which cut is exactly
[SPEAKER_04]: which is problematic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very problematic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, it ended up being it's
like one of those things where it ended up
[SPEAKER_04]: being like one of my favorite cuts for
effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was pretty finicky grower and it
could really freak out on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it led to a lot of people getting
rid of it until somehow me and maybe one
[SPEAKER_04]: or two other people ended up being the
only people with it is really kind of what
[SPEAKER_04]: happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, and you know, strangely
enough, um, before I even knew mean gene,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, mean gene got this sour cut from a
mutual friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was, it was my, it was the
headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it makes sense if it was being passed
to sour by Mandelbrot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the other thing is too, is that,
and this is, this is an admission,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, but there was an era where like a lot
of people would come up to Humboldt Mendo
[SPEAKER_04]: and they would act like a big dog,
like they were a big broker and they were
[SPEAKER_04]: in control and they had the money and they
were the man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in reality, the actual man that gave
them the money was like, go up to Mendo
[SPEAKER_04]: and buy these, buy one of these three
strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there would be times where it was like,
I would have amazing chem D or have
[SPEAKER_04]: amazing this or amazing that and they'd
smoke it and they'd be like, this is
[SPEAKER_04]: absolute fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they'd admit to me that they
didn't have permission to buy that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it would happen all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I need to buy these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the things I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have permission.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like they wouldn't want to admit
that, but when it came down to it,
[SPEAKER_04]: cause finally I'd be like, dude,
if you think this is some of the nicest
[SPEAKER_04]: weed you've seen in like eight months,
why won't you snap it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'd be like, well, it's a guy that
I'm getting it for.
[SPEAKER_04]: He told me I can only get these two
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my whole crew started selling that
headband cut as sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it became the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was this thing where it was like
all these people wouldn't have permission
[SPEAKER_04]: to buy headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And nobody knew what the LA Kush was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could buy sour diesel all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we called it sour diesel to people
because that's what moved and they would
[SPEAKER_04]: absolutely love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the person that they gave it to,
they would be like, you can, I want you to
[SPEAKER_04]: get as much of that sour diesel as you
possibly can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's the one I want to find that
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was, it was this whole thing,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where it was like all of my crew knew it
was headband, but the brokers only had
[SPEAKER_04]: permission to buy two or three things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it passed as sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though it was more like fuel and
diesel than it was the traditional actual,
[SPEAKER_04]: like what I consider to be the sour nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, me and Gene, he gets it as sour
and that formed the basis of what he still
[SPEAKER_04]: has today called the root beer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he lost a cut and he kept getting
back different sours and none of them were
[SPEAKER_04]: the, none of them were the cut that he
used to make the root beer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then years later, I'm sitting next to
him and you know, we're, we're hanging out
[SPEAKER_04]: together and I pass him a jar and I was
like, tell me what you think of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he opens it up and he's like,
holy shit, that's the sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the sour I, that's the sour I used
to make the root beer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for us, it was like, we never like
renamed it intention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like at first, at first it was renamed
because like it didn't come with a label
[SPEAKER_04]: and everybody assumed it would look so
close to diesel that it had to be diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it wasn't whatever headband it
was supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had to be diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we called it diesel for a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Mandelbach cleared it up that it
was actual headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then brokers still wanted it as sour,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it ended up getting called,
you know, I mean, the the labels never
[SPEAKER_04]: changed, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in our own personal gardens or
anything like that, those always stayed
[SPEAKER_04]: the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, you know, and we always
called it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, for a bunch of my friends,
it's like they got, you know, that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It ended up being like the sour diesel cut
that they ran for years, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: during that whole hype phase or whatever,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, so and yeah, and it's like
it and ended up getting dropped by most
[SPEAKER_04]: people and lost and renamed and different
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then it ended up where only a
couple of people have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's still like in terms of potency,
it's it's way, way, way up there in terms
[SPEAKER_04]: of effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's still it's still one of my all
time favorites.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's probably like the biggest issue I
faced.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like when I would try to describe it,
like I said, is that if I called it
[SPEAKER_04]: headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody had familiarity with some other
headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they believe that whatever headband
they had the familiarity with was the real
[SPEAKER_04]: headband, the real only and the original.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if I called it L.A.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush, then I get a bunch of people
laughing at me that I was an ignoramus and
[SPEAKER_04]: that I didn't know what real Kush was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'd show me what real Kush was,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, of course, I knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those of those and those were like the
only two names, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, and all that, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it became really difficult to like
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's this funny thing with
elites.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it happened to us with the dog,
too, where, you know, various brokers and
[SPEAKER_04]: different people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, how good can it be if I don't
have access to it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know what the best stuff out there
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know what most is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what the best desirable stuff is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if I don't have access to it,
my buddies don't have access to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not one of these hype things.
[SPEAKER_04]: How good can it really be?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you battle that kind of stuff like
people would people would trip now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, I mean, there was a point in
time where, like, you know, people didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: want to buy the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't frosty enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't look good enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if they were willing to sit down
and smoke a joint, 100 percent,
[SPEAKER_04]: it would go.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if they're just but, you know,
lots and lots of people are just basing it
[SPEAKER_04]: off name, look, nose, price.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, the longer things have gone
on, the less and less people smoke and the
[SPEAKER_04]: more it becomes just about like,
I'm just middlemanning this to the next
[SPEAKER_04]: person.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so I just need a price point and
a label.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is why, you know, and that's what
started like other people like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, breeding with all this different
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where, you know, Blackberry
Kush or this or that or, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: people changing names to like add a name
that like, you know, would sell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just need a name that'll sell.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got this cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't sell.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to add a name to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone needs to take it from me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the you know, I don't I mean,
you know, and then, you know, if you want
[SPEAKER_04]: to talk about headband, is my cut the day
record?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, is my cut the original headband?
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely know that it existed years
before some of these other ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, you know, like the other
headband and the Loompa, those are
[SPEAKER_04]: basically like, in my opinion,
those are just straight Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, those are OGs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, those are just straight OGs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know if they're S1s or Bag
Seed or whatever else, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: they they're very OG Kush dominant,
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very OG Kush dominant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't breed for anything else
where, you know, you know, and so,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, is headband sour OG?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it just Super Skunk 91?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a Colombian Super Skunk leaning
Fino.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's theories that I have,
but not a bunch of pre-existing proof.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when it really comes down to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's interesting is that,
you know, I've posted pictures where I
[SPEAKER_04]: showed you where we had some, I had some
friends of ours that went to the hills of
[SPEAKER_04]: Columbia and brought back some seed and we
grew it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Colombian looks the closest thing
to the, to the LA headband that I've ever
[SPEAKER_04]: seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember seeing this picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Side by sides where it's just,
obviously it's not the exact same.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like the color, the structure,
the look.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously like, you know, there's
Colombian and Skunk, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what if it's just a 91 Super Skunk that
leaned Colombian?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's very, very possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: But kept some of that, you know,
that, that, you know, that 91 power.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not that that means anything because
obviously it's just a trait, but it does
[SPEAKER_04]: varigate, you know, especially if it gets
hungry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, I can almost,
you know, and so, I mean, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff like that where it's like,
sometimes you get a lot of information and
[SPEAKER_04]: you can really nail down like provenance
and lineage and where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, and other, other strains
just because of the nature of the beast
[SPEAKER_04]: and how it's all black market or came from
prohibition era.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get as much info as you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you hit a point where it's just
like a wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a live feed and it's, I think it's
up on YouTube if people want to look,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I actually tried to show what happens
when you've researched the Dayreq or
[SPEAKER_00]: original diesel cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the best way I would just a framework
for how I would go about starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: research a strain that I have no history
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And funnily enough, like we talk about,
dude, the diesels are just convoluted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things pop up out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all of a sudden this,
this clone is injected into the scene with
[SPEAKER_00]: no, with no history.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I have, I have some, I mean,
you know, we, we've discussed it and I
[SPEAKER_04]: have some, I have some tidbits that aren't
very well known that I think are part of
[SPEAKER_04]: the sour story.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the complete sour story,
but it's certainly parts that don't get
[SPEAKER_04]: talked about too much, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, and then it's, and then
there's also this thing too, that happens
[SPEAKER_04]: where it's like, you have people that are
young and they're in their early twenties
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're making decisions and they end
up doing stuff that becomes famous years
[SPEAKER_04]: later.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, there's rep and,
and this and that attached to all that
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how do you, you know, how do you
delicately search for the truth without
[SPEAKER_04]: stepping on their toes about like,
you know, certain aspects of their story
[SPEAKER_04]: or history where you're not even like
trying to like out out and call them like,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're a liar.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're this, you're that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you're doing stuff when you're 19,
20, 21, 24 or whatever, and then 10 years
[SPEAKER_04]: later, it becomes famous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you don't know what you were doing
at the time was going to matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without a doubt.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you even, you know, maybe,
maybe your memory isn't even that good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, maybe, you know, maybe you
don't, I mean, what they've discovered,
[SPEAKER_04]: right, is that one of the most unreliable
things in court systems is eyewitnesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've watched a lot on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've proven it over and over again,
where it's like eyewitnesses, you would
[SPEAKER_04]: think that, but people's memories are
different, you know, and they can convince
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves that they remember things that
aren't exactly the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Memories and perspectives, everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, you might have an incident
where like one of your best friends and
[SPEAKER_04]: you experienced something and they barely
remember it, but it sticks in your mind,
[SPEAKER_04]: like really strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, you can't believe that they
don't remember certain details because you
[SPEAKER_04]: remember them really clearly and they have
a vague memory, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Brinn deals with that with me all the
time, where she looks at me like I'm an
[SPEAKER_00]: alien because I don't remember something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that kind of stuff really does play
into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, you know, I mean,
obviously this is like a wide ranging
[SPEAKER_04]: topic about things, but I mean,
I think, and I think I have some
[SPEAKER_04]: reasonably good proof that I think the
basis of sour diesel is 91 by Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and, you know, it's that,
you know, there's certain things that I
[SPEAKER_04]: believe that are just like evidence based
on like observation of knowing the strains
[SPEAKER_04]: and seeing them both bred together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then, you know, we have other tidbits
too, where it's like, and I don't know if
[SPEAKER_04]: this should be the time that we talk about
this or not, but, you know, after Chemdol
[SPEAKER_04]: got the Super Skunk in 93, he started
growing it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it hermed all over his stuff.
Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mentioned this on the live,
but I'll bring it up again just for the
[SPEAKER_04]: people that missed it, where the Super
Skunk was unusual in that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you have an eight week strain or a nine
week strain and you get tiger striped
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds out of it when it's finished,
it got pollinated in like week two or
[SPEAKER_04]: three.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it takes a good, anybody that
breeds knows it takes a good four or five
[SPEAKER_04]: weeks from pollination, you know,
or even longer at times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a big 12.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For really, I mean, I just mean after the
initial pollination, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it takes a good long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're finding viable seeds off a
strain you cut at 62 days or something,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was probably pollinated in week three.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Real early on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the Super Skunk would throw herms
early and late, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a real pain in the ass in that
regard and it was super live pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really, it really was.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you stressed it at all or
anything like that, it would just throw
[SPEAKER_04]: live bananas.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, and I mentioned this too,
is I think that with linked traits,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the most ranked Super Skunks came
with herms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that some of that turp was linked
to that hermaphrodism trait and that as
[SPEAKER_04]: people tried to breed away from it,
they bred away and more towards the Sweet
[SPEAKER_04]: Skunk or the Onion Garlic Skunk and not
like the Rank Rank Skunk, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, so Chem Dog calls up my buddy
in 1994 and he's super excited because
[SPEAKER_04]: he's grown up some of these seeds that
accidentally got made by him growing the
[SPEAKER_04]: 91 and the Super Skunk in the same room
and he is in love with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he calls up my buddy from Staten Island
and who's obviously in Sonoma at this
[SPEAKER_04]: point and he's super excited in 1994
because the Super Skunk accidentally
[SPEAKER_04]: pollinated the Chem Dog and he's growing
out some of these things and he thinks the
[SPEAKER_04]: hybrids are incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're bigger, they're more vigorous,
they reek, all this stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was actually one of the
inspirations was for even beginning the
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously we wanted to combine the traits
into a single thing, but we already knew
[SPEAKER_04]: people that had accidentally done it and
this is obviously way long before
[SPEAKER_04]: reversals or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that wasn't even in the cards.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he was ecstatic.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was preferring to grow these to even
the Chem Dog, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were bigger, they were stinkier,
they were more rank, they just... And
[SPEAKER_04]: think about it too, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So 1994 or whatever, I mean, you're
talking Chem Dog is in his early 20s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Super young still.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he was telling my buddy that he was
basically running rooms of these things,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because they yielded better and all
that, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was selling it as Chem Dog because
that was his name, that was his gig.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was his brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like you weren't buying a strain,
you were buying Chem Dog's weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of how they looked at it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, so I've grown the 91 for a couple of
decades now and, you know, VA has grown it
[SPEAKER_04]: for a quarter century now, you know,
and various things and it really doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: harm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't make seed, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the part that people don't know is
that... So you take this conversation
[SPEAKER_04]: where he's expressing to my buddy how much
he loves growing the hybrids and he's
[SPEAKER_04]: growing rooms full of these hybrids and
he's having great success.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we interviewed Vondo and those
guys, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They said in 1994, when they were getting
all that work from Chem Dog, they found
[SPEAKER_04]: what, 15 or 18 seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something along those lines as they were
getting the work from him, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a bunch of people were, you know,
they've always, you know, everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: thought, okay, you know, like the story is
that, you know, it came out of Chem 91
[SPEAKER_04]: seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that was the basis of it,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But without that conversation to my buddy,
you wouldn't know that he was actually
[SPEAKER_04]: growing hybrids then.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, and then, you know, like when you,
when you take what I consider to be any of
[SPEAKER_04]: the children of the super skunk,
they all have herm tendencies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It all passes that herm trait onto it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and so, you know, in like,
I don't even think I've found 15 or 18
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds in Chem Dog in the 20 years I've
grown it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like it just doesn't,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So for them to find that many in the space
of like half a year, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you combine that with,
then you combine that with the fact that
[SPEAKER_04]: Chem Dog expressed how happy he was with
the hybrids that he'd accidentally made,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: He thought they were significantly better
than the original, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least that's what he said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, I can, I can totally see that
in the sense that, you know, like the best
[SPEAKER_04]: super dogs that we did years later had the
growth and the vigor and the stretch and
[SPEAKER_04]: the rank of the skunk, but it had the
potency and the depth of power of the,
[SPEAKER_04]: of the 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, we, we, we had a slightly
different path to that and that ours
[SPEAKER_04]: wasn't an accidental herm pollination,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I could totally see that
happening, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's selling all that as Chem Dog
because he's Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's his brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's his brand, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and so, you know, and so then these,
so then Vondo and these guys, they collect
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever it was, you know, X amount,
some amount of seeds in the teens and they
[SPEAKER_04]: grow those up, you know, in, in,
and, you know, they get diesel,
[SPEAKER_04]: they get diesel one and two, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of that diesel one herms, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're not sure what else was in the
room or exactly what happened,
[SPEAKER_04]: but out of that herm came the first sour
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe he said that they were seeds
in a bag he labeled our diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you look at those Polaroids that
in this last six or eight months that
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk VA has been posting, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the sour in the structure of
that super skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can, it's just like as clear
as a bell.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see it, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so do I know the whole sour diesel
story, you know, um, by, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: every step of the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I think that those two bits of
evidence that aren't super well known,
[SPEAKER_04]: like I think the fact that it started out
as beans out of a 91 super skunk hybrid
[SPEAKER_04]: are pretty solid without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there, there's two things,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the beans that they were finding,
they could have been, they could have
[SPEAKER_04]: been, um, S ones of this 91 super skunk,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they could have even been the super
skunk pollinating that hybrid itself
[SPEAKER_04]: again.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sure could have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he, you know, he was still growing
the super skunk every rep, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, you don't know, it's hard to
say, but you know, the original sour cuts,
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see the dog and I can see the super
skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: In both.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I mean, you know, I grew the super
skunk for 10 years before I lost it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We still have the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can, in the, you know, in the,
in the original sour cuts, I can see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in there, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that's another thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where it's like that super skunks,
you know, ability to herm on itself,
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially created like an enormous line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a major part of the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sour diesel for a good 10 years was
like the most famous, the most desirable
[SPEAKER_04]: cut in America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: The East coast had an endless,
endless desire for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sure did.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it had the nose, it had the
potency, it had the name, it had power,
[SPEAKER_04]: it had all those types of things,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, so, you know, I mean,
there's all this, these rumors about DNL
[SPEAKER_04]: and RKS and this and this and everything
else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we got to hear Vondo's
version and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just like anything else, there was a
few other plants in the room at the time
[SPEAKER_04]: too, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, so it's not like,
it's not 100% figured out and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: unlikely just the way that it worked out
with a bunch of young kids growing some
[SPEAKER_04]: rooms and partying at the same time that
it ever would be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I think that, you know,
that part of it isn't, is, is really not
[SPEAKER_04]: known at all, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it isn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a lot of people just assume that,
oh, it had it, you know, the basis of it
[SPEAKER_04]: is this, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people don't realize that like,
you know, ChemDog called things ChemDog
[SPEAKER_04]: because that was his brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, he called the D later on
ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're buying weed from ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, uh, and for the time that
actually, that made sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people would have done that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I don't think it was anything
shady.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like people didn't have
this like intensive like lineage and this
[SPEAKER_04]: and that and everything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_04]: He grew ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_04]: You bought ChemDog from ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, whether that was the 91
or that there, that was a 91 super skunk
[SPEAKER_04]: hybrid or whether that was the ChemD,
you know, or whatever else you're buying
[SPEAKER_04]: ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all those things he was growing were
probably fire because the parent genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: were incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not like anybody was unhappy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, those guys, Vondo on those guys,
they saved all those beans and cracked
[SPEAKER_04]: those beans because those things were
fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they knew they were special.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they knew they were special cause they
were getting fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like when they realized there was seeds
in there, they kept hunting for more seed
[SPEAKER_04]: to save.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like a traditional 90s, you know,
you find beans in a good bag of weed and
[SPEAKER_04]: you put it in your little box.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: In your sock drawer or whatever,
you know, and so they, but then,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the most likely thing to me is
that the diesel one or whatever hermed on
[SPEAKER_04]: itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I would agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and then it's a, it's a mix of,
you know, and then you're going to get all
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever is, whatever the 91 actually is
combined with super skunk, which is a
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk one by Maple Leaf Indica.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get a whole range at that
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, through those diesel S ones,
I was able to see so much of super skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of its different expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it may have been one of the
most valuable tools and learning
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences in my breeding career was to
go specifically through those diesel S
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and, and it's like it,
you know, people have tried to piece
[SPEAKER_04]: together the story and it becomes all it
takes is a little bit of misinformation or
[SPEAKER_04]: a little bit of misunderstood information.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you try to like extrapolate a
bunch of facts based on that, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but you look at, you know,
you look at some of the stories where it's
[SPEAKER_04]: like, Oh, well, this stuff was chem 91 by
Northern lights one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, but then it doesn't look anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you look at the sour diesel and
you look at those old pics that skunk VA
[SPEAKER_04]: is posted of the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, Oh man, that looks like
they look very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and that segues into the,
the Massachusetts super skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically, what we've, what we've been
learning lately in regards to possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: there'd be there being two different cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, so, you know, one of the
things that happened is that, I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is just, this is just conjecture on,
and, and on my, on my view, obviously,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I'm from the East coast and I
wasn't tied into those crews super deeply.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I will say that like most of the
stuff that I believe I had talked to my
[SPEAKER_04]: buddy from Staten Island extensively about
the entire history of all of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we used to, we used to sit around
and, you know, the, that original SS cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you opened up the 90 seed bank
catalog from Neville, you could take side
[SPEAKER_04]: branches of that SS and you could hold it
right up to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would be like an exact match.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was just exact, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, and he would show trimmers all the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, look, that's super skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's super skunk, you know, and,
you know, we've recently learned,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, from, you know, skunk VA's
mentor or whatever, that it was basically,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the, the most likely thing is
that it was a super skunk F2.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is, is the, is the, is the most likely,
you know, story that we know that seems to
[SPEAKER_04]: be the most based in, in, in fact or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, and he labeled it six and that
led to a bunch of confusion because some
[SPEAKER_04]: people called it six and some people
called it super skunk and those two groups
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't really overlap, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's still some, some not
entirely perfectly known, but that seems
[SPEAKER_04]: like it's most likely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're starting with, you know,
something that, you know, obviously he
[SPEAKER_04]: kept it because it was the skunkiest of,
of skunks, you know, and can you talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you talk about some of its growth
traits?
[SPEAKER_04]: How did it grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can see, you know,
it grew a bit like sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_04]: but not as dense.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had that feathery look long and lanky
long lanky spears, you know, it looked
[SPEAKER_04]: dense, but it was really light.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that makes sense, you know,
like, especially if you got it too dry,
[SPEAKER_04]: you could just crisp it with your fingers,
you know, it would, it would look full,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there was a lot of like air to bud
ratio.
[SPEAKER_04]: In there, you know, silver pearls that
way, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, it, um, you know,
it, uh, for most people, it looked kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: like a less dense, sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you could have a huge butt of it
and it wouldn't, you'd put it on the,
[SPEAKER_04]: on the scale and it wouldn't weigh that
impressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it was, it was the opposite of like
rock hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though, even though it might look
firm, it wasn't dense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was lime green.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really, if people want to,
like I said, um, you can look at that 90s
[SPEAKER_04]: super skunk in the seed bank catalog,
that famous picture, and he would hold up
[SPEAKER_04]: side nuggets, prop after crop after crop
to that picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would be like a dead ringer if you
would.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it just looked exact and he would
laugh about it, you know, because they're
[SPEAKER_04]: super skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's your proof.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it looks exactly like it does in
the catalog.
[SPEAKER_04]: It reeks like a dead skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and like I said, it wasn't,
you know, it wasn't the, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like by today's standards, it's potency
wasn't on par with the best stuff we have
[SPEAKER_04]: today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just, it just, it was moderate potency.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we've, we've both found that
like when you find the terpiest things,
[SPEAKER_04]: they tend to be not the most potent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, maybe that's because some of
those terpenes haven't converted into,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, THC or whatever else,
or entourage effect or whatever you want
[SPEAKER_04]: to call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, sometimes really flavorful,
flavorful things are either light or
[SPEAKER_04]: moderate and potency.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is what led us to like the superdog
project was trying to combine the potency
[SPEAKER_04]: of the dog with the flavor of the super
skunk, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so getting back to what you were
talking about, people call it the
[SPEAKER_04]: Massachusetts super skunk, even though
it's from Virginia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only reason why it's called
Massachusetts super skunk is because my
[SPEAKER_04]: buddy dropped it off with chem dog on his
way back out to the West coast after
[SPEAKER_04]: getting the dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's hard to say, you know,
I mean, unfortunately, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: as this pretty famous by now, chem dog got
wrapped up in that whole res, the rat
[SPEAKER_04]: issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he got busted in 1996, I believe 2006
or 96.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it might, it might've been earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just remembered the, the, the high
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one he did, I want to say was.
[SPEAKER_04]: 2006, but my point, my point to all that
is that I think he, he definitely got,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if you look back on the old
forums, he definitely got himself into a
[SPEAKER_04]: bit of trouble in 96.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think most of the super skunk that
got passed out after that, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: like doesn't look like those pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that skunk VA posts.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: They looked much shorter.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks much more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks much denser, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Short squat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Short and squat instead of being long and,
and, and running, you know, light spears,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so, you know, it's amazing that he
has those pictures from 1995 because those
[SPEAKER_04]: are absolute evidence that's guaranteed
the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to find those solve or being
able to see those pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It answered a lot of questions that we had
had.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and so it's, well, then it's
like, I mean, he grew it for quite some
[SPEAKER_04]: time and I grew it for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so did other friends of ours and
stuff, but it's like, there's no way you
[SPEAKER_04]: can convince people based on your memory,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So having actual evidence like that from
that era, you know, I think it's quite
[SPEAKER_04]: possible that, you know, there was a mix
up on the East coast and what got really
[SPEAKER_04]: passed around at length about as MSS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and what was used in diesel was
whatever the second cut that was going
[SPEAKER_04]: around as MSS was, you know, now it's also
entirely possible that it, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it could be, you know, that could be an S
one found in the actual buds of super
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it definitely could,
um, because it hermed, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so, you know, maybe he had,
you know, some seed in it, like I said,
[SPEAKER_04]: in your nineties box of good seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe he had some seed that he found in
the chem dog from super skunk seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where some of those hybrids and
other things came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then maybe he had some feeds he found
in super skunk and that's where that came
[SPEAKER_04]: from, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why your G's experiments look
so close to so many different kinds of
[SPEAKER_04]: super skunk expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's definitely super skunk in
it, but because it wasn't, it wasn't the
[SPEAKER_04]: same one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, various, various MSS
have popped up in recent years as the
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk terp, um, has been, you know,
has been sort of like the unicorn or the
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy grail and everyone wants to have it
and claim that they've got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, but until somebody like me
or, you know, uh, skunk VA or others,
[SPEAKER_04]: like everybody claims seeds of it,
but nobody brings jars to events where,
[SPEAKER_04]: or passes it out where you can be like,
Oh, this is it.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, people want to breed with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: People want to get it and be like,
Oh, this is legit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then it doesn't look like the one of
old.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't smell like the one of old,
you know, we, we both know that skunk VA
[SPEAKER_04]: has gotten a number of, of cuts or samples
of things that people are pretty sure is
[SPEAKER_04]: it from the East coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he doesn't think they're even close.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so, you know, as far as we know,
it's dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For all intents and purposes currently,
that is the status of MSS.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if it's not dead, it's with people
that, you know, someone could still have
[SPEAKER_04]: it somewhere, but it's not tied into,
um, you know, the community where it
[SPEAKER_04]: hasn't actually popped up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and you know, that can happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes things can be lost and one or
two people ends up having it and they
[SPEAKER_04]: don't even realize that it's cause they're
not tied into the forums or the Instagram
[SPEAKER_04]: or the larger community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't even realize they're
sitting on something rare and amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it could be that, you know,
it's a little more suspicious now because
[SPEAKER_04]: so many people want to find it and then
want to sell beans of it and have it and
[SPEAKER_04]: have that Terp again, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but so far it's been a lot of,
uh, a lot of dead ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a lot of, um, MSS names,
but the Terps just don't match up.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they don't match up and the look
doesn't match up and it's not,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just, uh, you know, they just,
they, it just doesn't match up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I mean, who knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know for a fact that some of her
children exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And her children had been bred into all
kinds of things, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, it, it, it is like we
were talking about with breeding way
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier, the progeny exists and are being
used in all kinds of ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but whether or not the mother cut
exists is a whole nother factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, until, until scum freezes,
the FDA put up those posts with,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, with the Polaroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I had to go off of as far
as mass super skunk, and I think most
[SPEAKER_00]: people, um, was that very first chem dog
article in high times where he shows one
[SPEAKER_00]: picture of something labeled mass skunk
and whatever is coming out of diesel is
[SPEAKER_00]: the spitting image of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and unfortunately, I, of course,
uh, because I'm so, so integral,
[SPEAKER_00]: integrally tied into the diesel cut,
um, I wanted it to be the original,
[SPEAKER_00]: but unfortunately that's not how shit
works sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just got to go with the facts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously it doesn't mean that
it's not an excellent cut in its own
[SPEAKER_04]: right.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, you know, I mean,
you know, on the varying expression,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously like if, if the original
super skunk cut that we've been describing
[SPEAKER_04]: as an F2 of super skunk in itself,
um, then who knows what was exactly a cut
[SPEAKER_04]: in those jeans.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we know that super skunk
originally was a, was a, an, an 80s skunk
[SPEAKER_04]: cross to a maple leaf Indica that was
known as Afghan T, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you could get some more Indica
variations.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could get some more skunk variations.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could get some Colombian or some
Mexican or some, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems like the diesel leans a
little bit more towards the Afghan side of
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then it seems like those pictures
that chem dog had in the high times leaned
[SPEAKER_04]: more towards the Afghan side.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sure did.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I mean, chem dog and stuff
like that, you know, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want anybody listening to any of
this to like, you know, jump down his
[SPEAKER_04]: throat and anything like that,
because in all honesty, like between the
[SPEAKER_04]: 91 and the Chem D and all that,
like several of my all time favorite cuts
[SPEAKER_04]: came out of his little rooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was 17 or 18 years old when he
popped the 91 and he was in his early
[SPEAKER_04]: twenties, making a bunch of these other
decisions when these other things were
[SPEAKER_04]: happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he just was had his little thing going
on and had no idea that everyone was going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be pouring over like every action and
every utterance and every everything later
[SPEAKER_04]: on to try to find out like the exact
history, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what it's like, you know what
it's like to be a, a young party you're in
[SPEAKER_04]: your twenties, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just, and just doing things and you
don't, you don't, you don't realize that
[SPEAKER_04]: they're going to, for most people,
what they're doing right then isn't going
[SPEAKER_04]: to have any future importance that
anyone's going to care about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for him, it's like that era of his
life has gotten put under a microscope,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and various things that he said
in 2006 or 2010 or 2015, I'll get,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, whatever the case may be.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, people expect him to have some
kind of encyclopedic knowledge of
[SPEAKER_04]: everything that happened, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even remember my early twenties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, and I mean, in all honesty
too, it's like, when you think about like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, uh, Joe B and P buds sold weed
on dead tour, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They sold him some weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't growing weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were buying and selling weed as
middleman.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, 15 years later, they realized,
that something came out of this bag of
[SPEAKER_04]: weed that they sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like for real, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, they played a critical
role in making it all happen, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, they might even be some of the
few people that actually smoked the herb
[SPEAKER_04]: that the 91 came out of.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dog, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dog bud or, you know, or whatever it
ended up being, you know, but like they
[SPEAKER_04]: got that from someone else and you know,
it's like you, let's say, you bought a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple pounds and sold them in a weekend
and then moved on to some other pounds and
[SPEAKER_04]: you did that constantly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like how much info would they even really
have?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and it's not like they knew the
17 year old kid that they sold weed to
[SPEAKER_04]: that took it home and grew some.
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't like tight personal friends
where they were part of the story after
[SPEAKER_04]: that until way later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was much, much later when they came
back and realized all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was basically like oh six.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before they realized.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now you're asking to them to remember
like some weed that they had for a few
[SPEAKER_04]: days, 15 years before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody, and everybody wants to know
like immense details about it when like,
[SPEAKER_04]: it seems like according to Peba,
like him and Joe B were on dead tour doing
[SPEAKER_04]: that from the mid to late 80s on
constantly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're asking them to remember like
one weekend, one stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that would be fucking impossible for
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: When that's all they were doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they didn't realize that any of that
was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't have any special importance
until forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but then, you know, later on,
like everybody expects me and these kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of people to be experts on everything chem
because they were there in the very
[SPEAKER_04]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, some of them didn't
have any interaction with chem dog that
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't smoke it again for many,
many, many years after that bag was sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really until the reunion era when
they found each other on the forums again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which was, I think, oh, six ish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's, you know, that might be
the year that Joe B and Peba actually
[SPEAKER_04]: first saw 91 in person.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And got to smoke some of it, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think they, they saw it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they, when they all got,
when they all, when they all found each
[SPEAKER_04]: other again, you know, chem dog gave,
I think chem dog gave Joe B four seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: that he said were part of the original
thing he found.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where the one and four came,
the one through the four came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: The NL five Hayes cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, whatever, whatever the,
you know, the one, two, three,
[SPEAKER_04]: four, that's where those came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they went over with the one,
two, three, four, and they traded that to
[SPEAKER_04]: our friend IC collective for the D.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That skunk, that skunk VA had flown out to
the East coast and gotten and brought
[SPEAKER_04]: back, you know, because chem dog had lost
the dog and wanted it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they, you know, and so, you know,
he flew out East and gave it to him and
[SPEAKER_04]: brought back the D.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I got the D was I know six when
they first brought it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, they were flipping out over
the 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get dinky D?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause they hadn't, they hadn't,
they hadn't seen the 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, until then.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because it was really only in
our little crew that, that saved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone else had lost every, you know,
I had to get Ben lost back East a long
[SPEAKER_04]: time before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was really only four or five of us
that kept it safe between that mid
[SPEAKER_04]: nineties and, and, uh, mid two thousands
era.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so, you know, I mean it,
and then there, you know, and I mean the
[SPEAKER_04]: whole D thing probably could be for
another, another, another episode or time
[SPEAKER_04]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's going to be a full episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: That, that, that has, that has a,
that has a long, long thing to it and
[SPEAKER_04]: various aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long have we been talking,
dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hour and a half, I think a cry baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you type it out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Two hours and 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's perfect, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you taking the time to
do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can cut the recording cry baby.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
