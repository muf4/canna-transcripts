[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this shit's on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm figuring out this camera shit,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta forgive me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been locked up for some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit's wild, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell phones and 6G's or whatever it's
called nowadays, shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason I'm calling you,
bro, is because you ain't really picked up
[SPEAKER_00]: yet or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my last video, or my call, video call,
whatever I left, I kinda talked some shit
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wanted to say sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or whatever, and I wanted to thank you for
everything you've done for me all real,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mom said I gotta keep my cool and shit all
be locked up down in that pen again,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gotta make sure I can keep that cool
head or whatever, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides blazing some of that Kim doll,
my- my- my homie Big Cat, he done hooked
[SPEAKER_00]: me up with a little Kim doll.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you ain't- you ain't fucking
answering this shit, helping me out or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, it's cool, but... I just was
wondering, bro, like, I ain't looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: a handout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or nothing shit like that today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted you to, you know,
spot me a few clones or some shit like
[SPEAKER_00]: that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, get me started or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't- I don't need lights or no-
nothing like that, no more but some
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fucking around with these Russian
cats, you know, sitting down the road or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like a dummy, I hooked them
up with my only little $150 I had and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna talk about how they're gonna
give me some good clones and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, the dude is big motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I- I wouldn't- anybody else, bro,
you know I'm God, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would've fucking just decked this cat
right in his fucking mouth showing up with
[SPEAKER_00]: some shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just disrespecting, you know, me and
really you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we ain't fucked with each other for
a while or whatever, but he showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought- he- I was like, man,
you- I was like, damn, you a big cat,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He- he didn't even say nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just said some shit in Russian and we
pulled out this little bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what the fuck, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the clones at?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looked at me like cold-blooded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, and you know me, bro, I'm- I've been
locked up, held down for a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll scrap with anybody, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm real.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he- he pulled out that bag,
bro, and fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the shit he gave me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm- I'm fucking God, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He showed this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: These- these are clones, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the shit he gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sitting there like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder- like I said, I was about to deck
this cat, but now I was like, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: he a- he a big motherfucker, you know what
I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, I just woke up on him like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting here looking up at him like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, fuck, it ain't even worth
it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got the pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a little $150 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is what it is, dog, but I was hoping,
you know, you could help me out,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, send me some shit on- on,
you know, for like old times sake,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: We ain't really talked or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we ain't been closed, but it would-
it would help me out, bro, and maybe,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I could kick some shit back on you,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Help a G out, I'll help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You scratch my back, I'll help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just scratch your old dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or whatever, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, playa- well, playa-
