[SPEAKER_04]: Ready, go!
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Pre-Order!
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders' Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, cool cats and kittens?
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a fun time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a little bit, we will be joined by
Notzo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I put out your favorite guitar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I see that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, all for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this background is nicer than the
yellow two-tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the nicer two-tone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm waiting for some people to pop in
and then we can get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about a few different
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk some Northern Lights,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to talk some Widow,
which we've never done.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't covered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably should devote a full episode
to just the White family at some point.
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely changed things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it definitely changed everything
post-95.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a 95 thing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a 95 thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it kind of dominated that and its
hybrids for probably a good 20 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, at least the next five or
10, you know, it ended up winning.
[SPEAKER_06]: It and its children and its cousins and
stuff won a bunch of cups.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it ended up getting crossed to
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything known to man and F-Gend and
copied and renamed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I remember when there used to be
this harvest festival that got thrown at
[SPEAKER_06]: the end of every season up by me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was kind of like word of mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the NCGA one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ron.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ten percent Ron, indeed.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, it was like a place where
like, you know, CSI and and flat like a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of people from like the forums and,
you know, that were movers and shakers in
[SPEAKER_06]: both America and Europe kind of came out,
you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's funny about that is like when I
first went to those things, I was like
[SPEAKER_06]: hoping because, you know, whatever it was
20 some years ago now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was in my 20s.
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, I was hoping to meet like old
timers like me that had that had things
[SPEAKER_06]: that I wanted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh, I'm going to get to go to
this thing and I'm going to meet all these
[SPEAKER_06]: people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was like everything that was
popular on Cannabis World.
[SPEAKER_06]: BCGA stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, not that it was bad,
but I just mean, well, Blue Widow,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, Apollo 13, Apollo 11.
[SPEAKER_06]: Genius.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, but but the but the two most
common things that were crossed then was,
[SPEAKER_06]: well, the three words, probably the blue
family, the white family and some stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: like Sweet Tooth that was coming out of
Steve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were family.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: People were taking mails of that stuff and
crossing it to everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just about everything there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not everything there, but a lot of things
there were some combination of those three
[SPEAKER_06]: families bred into everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was white everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the white tails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to start with Shanti or
Indamar or somewhere in between?
[SPEAKER_06]: We can we can start with I guess we'll
start with I guess we'll start with
[SPEAKER_06]: Shanti.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's the absolute fact is like in
1995, Neville and Sensei and that whole
[SPEAKER_06]: crew, they still kind of dominated the
scene.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Shanti at the at the greenhouse label,
he released White Widow, right,
[SPEAKER_06]: which had a combination of it was
different than all the stuff that other
[SPEAKER_06]: people it wasn't just a renamed rehashed
thing, which is so common right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And but back then in Europe, too.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't a rehash.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was something new.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a super frosty, potent,
high THC Afghan that crossed well with
[SPEAKER_06]: things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it sort of turned cannabis on its
head.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: It had a killer name, you know,
and that was like back in the day when
[SPEAKER_06]: you'd get those like high times with the
super nice spreads for the cannabis cups
[SPEAKER_06]: and like white.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything just started being labeled
throughout all those winners.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_06]: All that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So so that's indisputable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shanti came out with a seed line.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But everything else about it is I guess
you could say is disputable.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's versions that exist.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one version which Shanti will tell
you that he bred it and it came from his
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it and it's a you know, and you know,
that's that's where it came from.
[SPEAKER_06]: It came from his travels and his stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he brought it there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's another there's another story that
is kind of promoted by like, I guess Arjun
[SPEAKER_06]: would be it and Ingmar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much all of Amsterdam is on the
Ingmar side as best I asked, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the things that are on the Ingmar
side.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Ingmar, Ingmar is this is this Dutch
gentleman.
[SPEAKER_06]: And supposedly in like 89 or 90,
he was smoking hash and out of the hash
[SPEAKER_06]: fell a few seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, which is pretty uncommon.
[SPEAKER_06]: But some it must have gotten just pressed
in there or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he found this thing that was
supposedly like maybe the cut of White
[SPEAKER_06]: Widow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they started selling it at grow
stores.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that started selling it to friends and
they started passing it around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, Arjun claims that he bought
it from dude years before Shanti got
[SPEAKER_06]: involved and all that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So where it came from and who developed it
and all that, there's kind of two camps.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it depends on who you talk to.
[SPEAKER_06]: All those dudes have beef with one
another.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it can be kind of hard to get like past
the beef.
[SPEAKER_06]: But definitely where it became what made
it famous was it being released,
[SPEAKER_06]: Shanti releasing another greenhouse label
in ninety five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fairness, you're always good at
passing the beef.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, what's interesting about
that, actually, is that so when I was a
[SPEAKER_06]: kid and I was going over to Amsterdam a
bunch, there was a bunch of dudes then
[SPEAKER_06]: that were in their 40s.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now they're in their 60s and 70s,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of there was camps just like we
have now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And California, there's people that had
beefs with each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are people that felt wronged on
deals that went bad or partnerships that
[SPEAKER_06]: went to skew or that motherfucker has my
cut or whatever the case may be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amsterdam in the 90s is actually like a
pretty good indicator of cannabis and now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because humans are the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we don't change all that much.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all the same type of interactions and
all the same like, well, you get credit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got credit for this.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was really mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that shit happens all the time
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I remember correctly to Peacemaker was
another one that was debated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Peacemaker was also Ingmar's
Peacemaker was also Great White Shark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they debated over that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was at that Cannabis Cup when Peacemaker
won.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's that's that's one of the
coolest names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's shitty that they got rid of it
and turned it into Great White Shark.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is a cool name.
[SPEAKER_06]: On its own, but it's like not quite
Peacemaker, which is now Shark Shock.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Peacemaker Peacemaker became Great
White Shark and then greenhouse
[SPEAKER_06]: trademarked Great White Shark.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can't call only greenhouse can call
strains that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when Shanti left, he called it,
you know, Shark Shock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's had, you know, like a lot of
cannabis strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's had three or four different names,
depending on what era you're in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went through hundreds of those seeds and
it that was a killer line.
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved it a lot, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the most potent weed I've ever
smoked came out of that line.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the weird part was is that I I could
get really skunky, like really turpy,
[SPEAKER_06]: skunky ones that were mild to moderate
potency.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I could get super potent ones that
tasted like cool smoke, but I could never
[SPEAKER_06]: get the the skunky, super potent one in
the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like that's a common kind of
thing with.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I look twice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kept one that I would I would classify
as turpless.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had an Appian Kush like that that was
very turpless.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't have off turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, it didn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was like the absence of flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was so potent, honestly,
like it gave me tracers in my vision.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I kept it even because even though it
didn't taste like anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and so I probably ran through
two, three, four hundred something like
[SPEAKER_06]: that seeds of great white shark from
Greenhouse trying to find because if I
[SPEAKER_06]: would have found if you could have found a
super potent one with as skunky as some of
[SPEAKER_06]: them were.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that would have, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of people's daily smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the white did that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's kind of like I just called
it the white.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, so you're really confused
about White Widow.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, White Widow was one of those
things where it's like kind of like the NL
[SPEAKER_06]: line with Neville.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's it's like it didn't have a lot
of turps, but it was super potent and
[SPEAKER_06]: super pretty.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it added it made the bud look nicer
and it made it look frostier and it made
[SPEAKER_06]: it look denser.
[SPEAKER_06]: All those things that growers like.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so people started blending it with
everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like Blue Widow was super famous
20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're in those parties, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you got that if you could get the
turps from the blue and some of the color
[SPEAKER_06]: and you could get the potency from the
other, like it was a pretty good marriage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could get the frostiness and resin
production of the widow on the blue.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, Widow was one of those things
just like, you know, cookies or Skittles
[SPEAKER_06]: or something like that, where like
everybody got it and crossed it to
[SPEAKER_06]: everything they had to see what would come
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of like it was one of those
type of strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was where all of a sudden for me,
it was one of the first like mega hyped
[SPEAKER_00]: name strains from my generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, when we were first getting
bags of fucking really good weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody would call it either white white
white rhino or white widow, whether it was
[SPEAKER_00]: or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was one of the first ones in my
generation that really broke through with
[SPEAKER_00]: the names.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shanti still sells white white rhino.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he calls it medicine man or
something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then like Simon had white Russian,
which I liked a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which was, which was AK 47 by White Widow.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it got it was a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was at Syria seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was white labeled like crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the Canadians, all the Canadians had
it and crossed it into everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was a yeah, but Blue Widow was
probably like, that was like two totally
[SPEAKER_06]: unrelated families that liked each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was some pretty good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pretty good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ron had a really good cut of that that
he'd pass around.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then people, tons of people had seed
of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty free seed trading era.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was before ST.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was before the feminized revolution.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so it was all still male based.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when it was easy to fucking make
seeds, it was easy to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I, I don't think I don't even know
anyone that's ever had a failure with a
[SPEAKER_06]: male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't either.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you'd have to I mean, you could
have one or two males in your room and hit
[SPEAKER_06]: it with a stick at the right time and get
100% pollination everywhere.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: The amount of effort that people go
through now to like make sure they get
[SPEAKER_06]: enough pollen out of reversals.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, and then even with that and all
still the failure rate and all that,
[SPEAKER_06]: but that back then it was like,
yeah, you picked the best couple of males,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it was like, what do you call it?
[SPEAKER_06]: You call it shot the shotgunning method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause you don't really know what the male
is going to do till you crack the seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're just kind of, you know,
everything until you run it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and so, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the white widow is like, the story is
either Shanti breaded, uh, which is like
[SPEAKER_06]: Sean and Shanti still sells it or,
uh, it was a clone that got found in
[SPEAKER_06]: Afghanistan and in Afghani hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And was sold as a clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so maybe they're both true in a way
because someone had to take it and make a
[SPEAKER_06]: seed line from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: At some point, I think both of them
claimed that there was Brazilian in it
[SPEAKER_06]: too.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was some kind of Brazilian sativa
mixed in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you look at like the, if you look
at all those picks and all the Finos
[SPEAKER_06]: you're getting from the nineties,
it was pretty heavily influenced by the
[SPEAKER_06]: Afghan side of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the black widow now that you can get
from Shanti, people find all kinds of
[SPEAKER_06]: sativa expressions in those.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't really, I mean, you know,
it's probably the, the parents probably
[SPEAKER_06]: changed at some point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's a long time to keep cuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, none of those, none of those,
none of those, none of those euros ever
[SPEAKER_06]: admit that they lost anything,
but everybody knows it loose shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they don't, you know, you ask sense
here or whatever, and they still have all
[SPEAKER_06]: the same original parents, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but yeah, I mean, white white widow
was, uh, that was, that was a good game
[SPEAKER_06]: changer as far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the biggest during its time.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the biggest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it kind of, it kind of replaced
skunk one as the, the primary thing that
[SPEAKER_06]: people crossed, you know, cause that's
what would happen in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like some new, amazing thing would
come out and everybody would buy seeds of
[SPEAKER_06]: it and then mix it with their own shit and
try to get on the same sales hype.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they do now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it was like a standard operating
procedure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that's even why people should
know that too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that like, that's even why some of the
old time breeders and stuff, they get all
[SPEAKER_06]: sketchy about telling you actual lineage
because they know that whatever lineage
[SPEAKER_06]: they say is just going to end up on some
competitors pack.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know, Shanti gets out there and
says, Oh, it's this by this, by this,
[SPEAKER_06]: and this is what we did do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that exact thing is, is on his is
two or three other seed companies.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're using, you know, so a lot of times
people like it, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, but we went from like Neville and
some people like that being very direct to
[SPEAKER_06]: today where people hide the secret socks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it still doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I, you know, when I see people
hiding their lineage, it tells me usually
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's a seed maker or a breeder that's
hiding the lineage, it just tells me that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're, they don't understand how
expression works or any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you, there's no reason to even try
to hide that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you can't make the same thing happen
twice and people get the same exact
[SPEAKER_00]: expressions twice, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I mean, I just think, I think it's an
ego thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: People, people like the illusion that
people did a lot more work before they
[SPEAKER_06]: release those seeds to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, that is true.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, I mean, I'm not saying that's
everybody, but that definitely percolates
[SPEAKER_06]: through the seed fucking world as far as
I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is people, people, people don't like
accidents.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want it to all be intentional and you
know, private genius that they revealed to
[SPEAKER_06]: the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys are killing me right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys are killing me.
[SPEAKER_03]: The old Jake hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jank hash, you know, and Jank hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I suppose I, I never saw any,
uh, I never saw any seeds come out of
[SPEAKER_06]: hash, but that doesn't mean it's not
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially back then when they were just
whipping shit, they weren't really
[SPEAKER_00]: filtering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that kind of shit, uh,
compressing the block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it happens back then.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean 90, you know, and, and I,
you know, I will say that like that area
[SPEAKER_06]: of Europe was the primary export area for
that, for hashish from Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's an old hash smoking culture
in Northern Europe over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they did have a bunch of like that
was America got much shittier hash than
[SPEAKER_06]: Europe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe, Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not only that, but there was like an
overland route that was traditional and
[SPEAKER_06]: been there for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: There wasn't oceans in the way that you
could get there via land, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: and through a bunch of countries that
weren't as hardcore about searching for
[SPEAKER_06]: shit as America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we got secret hash most of the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even realize how good traditional
hash could be until I got to Amsterdam and
[SPEAKER_06]: started meeting certain people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, really eye opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I derailed this conversation,
um, I'm going to put up a pack of the
[SPEAKER_00]: banana tie, uh, F ones up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody wants them, I'm starting them
at 200 and then we're going to go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just pin it as we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, as it gets higher, I'll add more
shit in, but I don't want to derail the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, banana tie at 200.
[SPEAKER_06]: Banana tie at 200.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so yeah, I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: We, um, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even think, I think white widow
was probably the widow family was probably
[SPEAKER_06]: the primary thing until kind of like the
sour and diesel waves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it was happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and then, and then Kush came
kind of quickly behind that, like Kush had
[SPEAKER_06]: been around for a minute, but like in
order to become popular, enough people
[SPEAKER_06]: have to have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was very hoarded.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I mean, that's, that's,
that's the weird thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, there was all this shit with
like the cam, you know, but it took so
[SPEAKER_06]: long because there was only like four of
us in California that had it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like how many, how, you know,
how many can like four garages and a
[SPEAKER_06]: couple of light depths and whatever else
even do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people underrate how much,
um, the Canna Bible came into play during
[SPEAKER_00]: this time, during that era, right at the
end of the widow era into the Kush era,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, in popularizing a lot of these strains
that people would never heard of smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: scene before stuff that, that was held
super tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Jason, uh, Jason King was at
those, was at those events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, uh, I was pretty good friends
with him back then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and actually like in, especially in
the second and third Canna Bible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, uh, a lot of the people that he
met and he photographed were either
[SPEAKER_06]: friends or associates of ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he came to Lake, he, he was living in
one of Eddie Lep's houses in Lake County
[SPEAKER_06]: and we would take them all over Mendo and
Humboldt and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, he would take, he would get
pictures of various people's farms and get
[SPEAKER_06]: introduced.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause back then, especially like you
couldn't just be like a photographer and
[SPEAKER_06]: be like, I want to take pictures of your
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was, that was, that was not the era
that that was acceptable.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you kind of needed like a friend,
someone who like, who would vouch for your
[SPEAKER_06]: existence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and so we, you know,
we, uh, but in that, in that Canna by,
[SPEAKER_06]: in the, I think it's on the second one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, my superdog is in there a bunch of
times.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Mendo perps is in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: The chem dog is in there, the snow.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had about, I don't know, mothership.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had about seven or eight things,
nine things or something like that,
[SPEAKER_06]: that we're all in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pineapple mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that one that you grew?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The, the, uh, I'm in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody just asked that the mothership is
kind of a crazy story, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I should tell it just because people would
trip out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jason King had this girlfriend at the time
and she was from, uh, the mountains of
[SPEAKER_06]: North Carolina, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Asheville, all that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as most people probably know,
Asheville is kind of like, it's a little
[SPEAKER_06]: different than the rest of Northern North
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit more hippie.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit more eclectic and all
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they had this, uh, they had this,
uh, strain out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They called the mothership.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he, uh, um, she was going to get
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shipped out here because it was this old
ass sativa that we wanted to try.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I agreed.
[SPEAKER_06]: They ship it out and, uh, fricking,
I'm, I'm thinking to myself, it's going to
[SPEAKER_06]: come and it's going to be, you know,
a couple of clones on a little box,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and this is, this has got to be
Oh two or something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So long before smartphones are like
checking your package online, like,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, just mailed it and when it
showed up, it showed up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm expecting this little box of
clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I opened the door one day and there's
this box that's like two feet tall on my
[SPEAKER_06]: doorstep.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I take it inside.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea what the hell it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I open it up and there's two plants of
mothership in there in dirt pots,
[SPEAKER_06]: staked, you know, and they're like,
they're like, you know, 22, 24 inches
[SPEAKER_06]: tall.
[SPEAKER_06]: Each one of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's two full one gallon pots with two
foot plants bent over in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they tamped down a bunch of
packing material and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the dirt didn't fall out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So instead of mailing us cuts or like
unrooted snips or any of like the modern
[SPEAKER_06]: tech or whatever, they literally mailed us
two, two foot tall plants in one gallon
[SPEAKER_06]: pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one way to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They both lived.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all those, all those pictures in the
Canna Bible of mothership, um,
[SPEAKER_06]: they all pretty much come from those two
moms.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what was in mothership?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: No clue.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no clue.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even like it that much to be
perfectly honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it has some off, like I know it still
exists, which is cool just because I don't
[SPEAKER_06]: think it's related to much else,
but it did this neat thing where it grew
[SPEAKER_06]: all these golf balls all over it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing was super floppy,
but it's the only plant I've ever seen
[SPEAKER_06]: that it would like flop over like 50% and
then just hold itself up and grow
[SPEAKER_06]: sideways.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like you really didn't, you didn't need
to stake it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would flop, but then it's stem would
like catch itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And instead of snapping, you know,
or just hitting the dirt or something like
[SPEAKER_06]: that, it would hold itself up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if you grew it in a greenhouse or
indoor, it would grow sideways through
[SPEAKER_06]: your plants and it would weave itself
through other plants you had.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, it was really, it was like the,
it was a really unusual trait.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's stems didn't want to snap and
they would give and then bring themselves
[SPEAKER_06]: back up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was kind of in that era where
weed was weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it hadn't really, that was even
before like the purple craze where Urkel
[SPEAKER_06]: and grape ape and granddaddy and all that
shit kind of took over.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was sort of like the last era where
people like any, any type of quality weed
[SPEAKER_06]: that people grew sold easily.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So people grew whatever they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was it a sativa type high to it?
[SPEAKER_06]: It had traditionally sativa type high,
you know, it had Fox taily buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it long flowering or not?
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't particularly long flowering,
like 11 weeks or something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you grew it outdoor, you kind of
wanted to let it ride till, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: Halloween.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in Mendo and Lake County and stuff
like that, it was a, it wasn't,
[SPEAKER_06]: that wasn't that hard to achieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's lots, there was lots of weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most, most good weed in my opinion was
done between the 15th of October and early
[SPEAKER_06]: November, at least where I was,
where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are asking for the not so dog
story, the name of not so dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to do it one more time.
[SPEAKER_06]: The name of not so dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll give the edited version.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the edited version is my buddy who gave
it to me also gave it to, he gave it to a
[SPEAKER_06]: couple other people, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not very many people had, there was like
four of us.
[SPEAKER_06]: He gave it to Skunk Vier, you know,
he gave it to, it got to, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: IC collective.
[SPEAKER_06]: It got, there was a couple up there,
but there wasn't, it was like four,
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe five at the most who had it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we used to do this thing where not
everybody had fresh weed all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'd keep each other in the loop about
who had what coming down when.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this person could grab a couple ounces,
this person could grab QP or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'd have smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'd have fresh smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so my buddy from New York,
he goes up to Tahoe to grab, um,
[SPEAKER_06]: we called the Tahoe dog, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and it grew killer up there because
it's so cold that the air that he would,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially in winter, the air that he
would bring into his grow room would be
[SPEAKER_06]: like in the single digits of the teens.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it would make that shit frost up like
really strong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it looked like compared to Mendo and
Sonoma where the rest of us were like,
[SPEAKER_06]: that mountain weed was like, it was nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had the same effect in Chicago in the
winter time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's something about bringing in
frigid air that just makes your plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a reactionary thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, he goes up there, he goes up
there to get this, he goes up there to get
[SPEAKER_06]: like a pound of dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's, and he's supposed to split it
with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he comes back and I was living,
we were living in Willets at the time,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is in Northern Mendo.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, dude, come meet me and get
this thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I come meet him and we're like,
it's the middle of winter and we're off on
[SPEAKER_06]: the side road and he hands me the bag and
he goes, tell me what you think.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something, there's something a
little different this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I opened the bag and I stuck my hand
in this bag and I started smelling it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, this is not so dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's, and I'm like, it's not so dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, I don't get what you mean.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, I'm smelling it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it doesn't smell like the dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: It smells like not, it's not so I don't
get the, and it turns out that homey,
[SPEAKER_06]: homey had, homey had mislabeled a cut and
then kept that cut as a mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's the worst.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it was actually like,
it was actually Romula.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why dude from New York was
tripping because it was so frosty and so
[SPEAKER_06]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He just thought he did this weird thing
and he crushed it and he brings it to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, I'm like in the dark.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hadn't even seen it yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even know what it looked like.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just stuck my face in the bag and I was
like, it's not, and so frosty.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm trying to, I'm trying to join
Instagram because everybody was bugging me
[SPEAKER_06]: that I needed to climb out from under my
rock and join Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm trying to join and every
fucking name I pick is already chosen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So after about 20 or 30 tries,
I get all pissed off and I think,
[SPEAKER_06]: well, what if I try this?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I put in not so, and that wasn't
taken.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was kind of like, it was just kind
of like an inside joke about how when
[SPEAKER_06]: homie, I mean, he got it back.
[SPEAKER_06]: We gave him the dog bag amongst us.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was like, it never got lost,
but there was individuals that lost it
[SPEAKER_06]: briefly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they had to get it back from one or
the other of us over that time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember our not so, our not so
experienced at the, at the, at one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: houses, the not so Bubba, the not so
Bubba.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do the not so Bubba.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was funny too, because I had
grown, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had like a couple of beds that I
basically grew, like all this headstache.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I basically like, you know,
I was so busy with harvest and all that,
[SPEAKER_06]: that I put all that headstache,
we, we dried it and bagged it and put it
[SPEAKER_06]: away, you know, and then I dug it all out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was me and a few of our friends
or whatever, like a night or two before
[SPEAKER_06]: that party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we went and we dug out like 40 or 50
kinds of weed and jarred it up and brought
[SPEAKER_06]: it all down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this guy that we're no longer friends
with anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't even say his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He, he had given me, he had given me the,
the Bubba Kush back, but it was actually
[SPEAKER_06]: Canorado's five by two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the five by two, his selection of
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was his selection of the five by two.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I crack open this jar and I'm like
showing it like our buddy Pip was there
[SPEAKER_06]: and bittersweet and and a bunch of us,
you know, and it was like, people are
[SPEAKER_06]: like, dude, do you know what the Bubba is?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, yeah, I know what the
Bubba is.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, what is this weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the weirdest part of that thing was on
top of all that weed, there was a big fat
[SPEAKER_06]: nugget Trinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it wasn't, there was only one nugget
of that trend on top of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the rest of it was all that
other, that was like some light turpentine
[SPEAKER_06]: midsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not, it was not a great expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that whatever that was, was not a
great expression of cannabis in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, that was some mids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved the fact that it was that dude
selection though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: His personal selection.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, when you, when you only,
when you only pop 10 or 15 seeds or
[SPEAKER_06]: something like that, it's really hard to
find a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that and like, you know,
things do change from seed to clone and as
[SPEAKER_00]: time goes, maybe it was cool as a,
as a seedling, but it really was not cool
[SPEAKER_00]: as a con or something, something.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was, we were lucky though.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was really the only thing that was
mislabeled out of all that work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that magical Trinity nug, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That magical, that magical and that,
that threw us off even more because that
[SPEAKER_06]: thing was so different, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, what the fuck did that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did this Trinity get in here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, we had, I mean that,
that year, I think we had, I had two six
[SPEAKER_06]: foot by 26 foot beds that I just grew like
all the mother stock and all the
[SPEAKER_06]: headstache.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those two years in a row.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I brought all that work down to,
uh, down to that party, so there was
[SPEAKER_06]: literally like probably like 40 flavors or
something on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we still have pictures of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was wild.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then some of it I didn't bring cause
it wasn't done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the 91 wasn't done at that point.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I didn't bring them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought the chem D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember you bringing the chem D,
especially the second time when resin got
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the white hot sweats.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was, that was actually pretty weird
because you always, you always talk about
[SPEAKER_06]: things, you know, and like, just so people
know when they're listening, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: we have, we have friends from all over and
stuff and we chat on discord and some
[SPEAKER_06]: different things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you talk about all this weed,
but it's not like you get to smoke all
[SPEAKER_06]: your buddies weed because we're a pretty
like dispersed group.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's people, there's friends
of ours from all over the country.
[SPEAKER_06]: All over California.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so a lot of times like we gather up
and it would be some of these people's
[SPEAKER_06]: first chance to smoke, like some of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and that, that can be that I did
inside.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew it under ceramics, ceramic metal
halides, and it, it, it put a few people
[SPEAKER_06]: on the couch, not being able to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, uh, one of the, one of the,
our friend resin was one of the very first
[SPEAKER_06]: people to grow OG Kush in LA.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, he got so high off sharing a joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: That he almost decided to go to bed and
call it a night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that he recovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden he's like just sitting
there sweating for like 30 minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of, and then he just goes,
I'm back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was really, uh, that was,
yeah, that's kind of cool too,
[SPEAKER_06]: because a lot of times like, you know,
you can smoke good weed and I don't care
[SPEAKER_06]: what kind of weed it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eventually you build some level of
tolerance to that specific stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you've never smoked it before,
you haven't smoked it in months and you
[SPEAKER_06]: smoke something different, you know,
like we're going to talk about the,
[SPEAKER_06]: the, the headband cut that I have in a
bit, like that, that we will get you high
[SPEAKER_06]: every day all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you haven't smoked it in two or
three months or longer, and you smoke that
[SPEAKER_06]: weed, the first four or five, 10 times you
smoke it, it's like different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a lot of weed that's like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, you know, that like, if you're
not whatever it's cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_06]: an entourage effect or whatever
combination, it's just like your body's
[SPEAKER_06]: not used to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it hits you a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could even be you're in a different
house, different environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: All kinds of things go into that for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So somebody was saying, I miss that kind
of, but it's not around like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're kind of right, but it is
around, but it's like people's,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, what people pick has changed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to find that in mostly in
cookies hybrids.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, you know, you're like,
you're most people like 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only reason why things were elite was
because enough smokers liked them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's a lot based on testing and
looks and hype and other various aspects.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of
flash in the pans or mids or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: They get pushed, you know, um,
where, you know, back in the day,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's like, I don't, not even everyone had
to say it was an elite, but enough smokers
[SPEAKER_06]: who were respectable were like,
this weed is fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it would kind of become generally
acceptable that whatever that was is fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and, uh, the, you know,
the named strain game has been really bad
[SPEAKER_06]: for diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure has, sure has, you know, so I
remember one of those years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it was, uh, Denali brought now
I'm used to smoking blueberries and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm used to them being, you know,
anti-anxiety for me and chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he brought out some old right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very OG crossed a G 13 hash plant seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd made a long time ago and he,
and he grew it and he handed me a due to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the Coke shits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember just like walking up in that
house, that first house, like up the
[SPEAKER_00]: stairs, like, yeah, that was fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some shit that'll get you.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually one of the things like
even, uh, when I was talking about those,
[SPEAKER_06]: those, uh, those Ron parties 20 years ago
is if you show up an event and you smoke
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 or 15 or 20 kinds of weed, you're not
used to smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to get some odd effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one second, um, drowning with
Dagon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to pronounce that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the one with juicy fruit tie in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's up for auction right now at two
20.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, someone says, someone says you're
growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're growing the headband,
any advice that people are asking about
[SPEAKER_06]: advice on the headband and I don't really,
I mean, those are two of like what I
[SPEAKER_06]: consider to be like the most potent
strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally have.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, you know, there's a lot,
I would just try to find plants you like,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, I mean, as far as effect goes,
that's me.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's generally speaking, the advice I
always give is it's like what try to find
[SPEAKER_06]: something you personally like,
you know, when, when you're, when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: sprouting seeds, everyone's brain
chemistry is vastly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, find something you like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's, there's things that like,
I love personally and Matt would despise
[SPEAKER_06]: as a daily smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and CSI and I don't have the
same taste at all when it comes to,
[SPEAKER_06]: he recognizes like we have the same taste
as far as like what we think of as good
[SPEAKER_06]: weed, but what we are preferences on what
we like to smoke are very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, um, Urkel even hits in the same
way that it hits me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas we like to breed with it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to grow it a lot, but fuck,
we will not smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause everything with it gives us fucking
panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attacks every fucking time.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are talking about flowering time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the chem D is usually like a,
I would say it's anywhere from like eight
[SPEAKER_06]: and a half to nine weaker, 10 weaker at
the most.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and the LA is more like a 10 or 11
most of the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So most of your Finos are probably going
to come in that, like nine to 11 range.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it's real squat and Afghan looking,
it probably leans D if it's tall and
[SPEAKER_06]: lanky.
[SPEAKER_06]: It probably leans a little bit more of the
headband.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, and we have some of the,
um, the, the LA Kush coming up probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be crossed to the NL five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the second round of the NL five stuff,
we were doing some hybrids with it as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as not so dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about your Maui.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Maui, the Maui is a cool story in
the sense that it goes like way back.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we, uh, in, uh, 1990, four,
which seems eons ago now, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had just, me and my crew had just kind
of turned adults.
[SPEAKER_06]: And back then it's like, and especially in
the Midwest where I was from, that's where
[SPEAKER_06]: you went to go get good weed seats was
Amsterdam, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we all flew out to Amsterdam and,
uh, the short version of the story is we
[SPEAKER_06]: bought a bunch of seeds and we were in
this coffee shop and there was this old
[SPEAKER_06]: man who was probably like in his forties
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: But to us, when we're late teens,
it's, he seemed ancient.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we literally like shared a cappuccino
and shared a couple of joints and shot the
[SPEAKER_06]: shit for 20 or 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he told us that he was from America
and he came out, he was from Maui and he
[SPEAKER_06]: came out and he traded, he was trading
seeds with some of the dudes in Europe and
[SPEAKER_06]: he did it every few years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he gave us, uh, he gave us a handful
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, just so happens that we go back and
we bloom all this shit that we bought.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the best thing that we had was this
weed from, um, Maui that the dude had
[SPEAKER_06]: given us at a coffee shop for free.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so since we didn't know anything about
it, cause we're dumb and we didn't ask any
[SPEAKER_06]: questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause we were like 19 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, only thing I know about it is that the
dude grew it on Maui and it is a really,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's kind of a strange plant and that it
has super thin, very thin, almost like
[SPEAKER_06]: Thai type leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're double serrated up both sides.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has like red PDLs on the underside of
everything and, but it's short.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only like eight weeks, eight and a
half weeks and it yields huge chunks all
[SPEAKER_06]: over itself, top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it, but then it had, it throws leaves
all over itself, but then the leaves are
[SPEAKER_06]: so thin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unlike a lot of Afghanis, it doesn't
really choke itself out with overleafage.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can like see through it if that makes
sense, because all the leaves are like
[SPEAKER_06]: this wide.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they're all really skinny,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we, um, that, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So CSI, I gave him that cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that cut is we sprouted that seed in
the summer of 1994.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to be 28 years old this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also has another Maui, I think as
well, the Maui Waui, if I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so he, so that one and that Maui,
um, that Maui ended up becoming relatively
[SPEAKER_06]: famous because I, uh, in probably like 02
or 03-ish, I gave a bunch of seeds to
[SPEAKER_06]: Mandelbrot of which, um, you know,
I gave him a bunch of Superdog by,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, Maui by Superdog.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he found this cut called the Truth in
there and he ended up breeding a bunch
[SPEAKER_06]: with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that Maui kind of like percolated
around.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and it was grown in Mendo for years
and years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, because it, it'll, it'll give you a
four to six pound plant that's done
[SPEAKER_06]: October 15th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got great resin production,
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got great resin production.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's, it's, I wouldn't call it like
an absolute elite, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, but it's got, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's got a decent high.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got crazy structure, crazy yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it's a really, it's like one of the
better plants I've ever crossed things to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so yeah, that he's going to use,
he likes pairing things or like looking at
[SPEAKER_06]: different varieties and trying to see what
he thinks is going to cross well together.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe something to do with,
uh, you know, Northern Lights has,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, potentially some Hawaiian in it,
different ones or whatever, like he's
[SPEAKER_06]: going to cross that to the, that's going
to get ended up getting crossed to the
[SPEAKER_06]: Maui.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but he released, what was it?
[SPEAKER_06]: He released the TK by Maui by TK and Maui
by B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and I get, I get pictures all the
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really seems like those, those,
uh, Maui by chem or the LA by Chem D
[SPEAKER_06]: people find tons of killer shit in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully, you know, um, one of the
things that's good about CSI is that he's
[SPEAKER_06]: prolific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, he's very prolific dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: So by me sharing some cuts with him,
it gives people a chance to try a bunch of
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff that they might hear about a bunch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, because, uh, he's probably
the most prolific reader I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, someone was asking the, the flower
time and parents on the banana tie,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is up for auction right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, God damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was the, the juicy fruit tie,
uh, crossed to the platinum banana,
[SPEAKER_00]: OG BX one flowery times right around some,
some people are getting them around nine
[SPEAKER_00]: to 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some pull it early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, it's, it tends to dominate
towards the mother cut, which is what I
[SPEAKER_00]: would have liked it to, to have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except that it does have added,
uh, resin production and some have that
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful banana with like juicy fruit
stripes, gum, for those my age or fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: stripes, gums, the best description of,
of what that, that mother cut smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now it's at two 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys want to grab it,
I don't have a lot of them left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just, uh, putting it up and I'll
throw in a pack of the silver pearl blue
[SPEAKER_00]: bonnet as well, which is actually perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pearl blue bonnet, the silver pearl S one
from our buddy pit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll toss that into and that's a nice cut
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that cut is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell in love with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first second I even saw it,
let alone smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I smoked it, it has this,
uh, it has its own type of bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: gumminess, which will lead me into
something else, but it has its own type of
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble gumminess that really was brought
out with the blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of good blueberry bubble gum
phenols.
[SPEAKER_00]: And speaking of bubble gum, uh,
me and TSI have a, a selection inside the,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll call it the number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it the number seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is as he, as he puts it,
and he's a big fan of Indiana bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of his favorite breeders,
all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is more pink bubble gum, louder pink
bubble gum than the Indiana bubble gum
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really excited to bring that one
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also crossing that specific,
uh, cut to bubble gum at some point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so a couple of things I'll talk about
silver pearl in a second, but one of the
[SPEAKER_06]: things that we should probably mention
that's neat is that one of the things
[SPEAKER_06]: that, that, uh, CSI does that a lot of
other people doesn't, doesn't do at least
[SPEAKER_06]: is that he'll, you know, you can do
multi-stage breeding, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where what Matt was just talking about is
it's like, he popped a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: He found things that he liked.
[SPEAKER_06]: He made selections and then he's crossing
those selections to a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_06]: other things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there's a lot of breeding right
now, just because the way the market is,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's kind of like one offs, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is neat, uh, in that sea of one offs
that where you can do some multi-stage
[SPEAKER_06]: where you can pick things, select things,
cross those things to other things that
[SPEAKER_06]: you like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you figure out what it is,
you know, um, and all that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And bubble gum is, is a turf in Afghani.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a Neville talked about some of
the maple leaf stuff smelling very
[SPEAKER_06]: strongly of bubble gums.
[SPEAKER_06]: The original big bud cut had a bubble gum
like nose.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's one of those, it's, it's one of
those turps that occasionally pops up in
[SPEAKER_06]: Afghans.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you'll get, you'll get a bubble
gum nose.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's interesting about that is that
while the Indiana bubble gum absolutely
[SPEAKER_06]: smells like chewing gum when it's growing
and when it's drying, it doesn't really
[SPEAKER_06]: taste the same than it smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's the, the, the one problem that,
that I found with it is that the taste
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't translate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, as well with the bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_06]: The smell, I mean, when it's, when,
you know, those terpenes in the air,
[SPEAKER_06]: when it's blooming, it's straight up
smells like bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you got that like big league chew
style flavor on your, on, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: on your taste buds, uh, it would probably
be one of the highest regarded cuts out
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, you know, I've had this,
uh, debate going on with CSI about looking
[SPEAKER_00]: through the Durbin poison, Indiana bubble
gum specifically, because I found out,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, in the, in the 95 cents, he started
lying.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bunch of turpentine and there
was one female that was hardcore pink
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble gum with some turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whereas it wasn't as pink bubble,
gummy loud as the Indiana bubble gum cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: the flavor was all pink bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in that, um, Durbin,
Indiana bubble gum, there, there is likely
[SPEAKER_00]: to be some, some bubble gummy tasting
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was, he was probably trying to push you
away from it just because you have to,
[SPEAKER_06]: you'd have to sift through so much
turpentine to find it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There'd be a lot of turpentine.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd have to find those, those runs as it
were.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody wanted to talk about the silver
Pearl.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll talk about that before we lose
track.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our buddy Pip has a cut of silver
Pearl, uh, lineage and origin unknown,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I will say it looks very, very,
very much like the Fino that Neville used
[SPEAKER_06]: to post at, uh, the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, you know, and it's sensei,
uh, it looks very, very, very similar to
[SPEAKER_06]: that exact plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and it, it looks like 90s weed for
lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not super dense kind of airy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it, uh, you know, this might be
something that like, like people think is
[SPEAKER_06]: off putting, but like, you know,
there's a lot of smells and weed that you
[SPEAKER_06]: wouldn't think are nice and other
instances, but in weed you like them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and, uh, it kind of smells to me like
really young baby poo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it does.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has, it has like a baby, like a,
like, not like when kids start eating
[SPEAKER_06]: food, but like when they're on like a pure
milk diet and they're a couple of months
[SPEAKER_06]: old, you know, uh, it has this like weird
baby poo type smell to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It does have a funk to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has a funk to it, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and what's interesting about that is
like, you might think, Oh gross,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, but roadkill is really gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's no, you know, people are
like, Oh, I want that.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, there's stink and weed that,
that like you related to something else.
[SPEAKER_06]: And life, but whatever that is,
it's gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried that, that shoreline recently,
both indoor and outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is some fucking gross to that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, but it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we, there's like a different
aspect to it where like, you can describe
[SPEAKER_06]: things that might be gross, but they're
good.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, that he, he created this,
it was called perfect Pearl, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the S ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, so yeah, he had, he had this cut
that I, I believe it's from the nineties.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just looks tough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like nineties weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably, and that, and we're
basically lucky in that regard because
[SPEAKER_06]: most weed from the nineties, most lines
we're lucky if one or even two phenols
[SPEAKER_06]: exist.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: At most.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, that's, that's basically
like how much has survived from just like
[SPEAKER_06]: 30 years ago, which is a crazy thing to
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so every, every, uh,
what are the three gaseous strains you've
[SPEAKER_06]: ever come across?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, gas to me, maybe we should talk
about that for a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, gas is skunk, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it doesn't have to be, but I feel
like, like that, that straight skunk smell
[SPEAKER_06]: and that sour diesel smell and that fuel
Terp and the gassiness.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think those are all like variations of
the same Terps, but you're going to
[SPEAKER_06]: confuse people that when you say skunk,
do you mean skunk one or do you mean super
[SPEAKER_06]: skunk?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like actual skunk?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can talk, we'll talk about action.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like skunk one is the most confusing name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, uh, you know, it, but yeah,
I mean it, it, um, like actual like skunk
[SPEAKER_06]: aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, which, which is like the,
everybody calls it like the lost Terp.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it exists in all these
different forms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just not in that pure roadkill form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a lot more accessible than
people realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, never left.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, like headband, like you look,
you look at diesel style plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: which there's a lot of, and they're just
like, like from a breeder's perspective,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're classic skunkoid type plants,
their bud structure, the way they grow,
[SPEAKER_06]: the way they look kind of Mexican,
Colombian with some density.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they, they're, I mean, that to me is
like the diesel family is like modern
[SPEAKER_06]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep, keep, keep, uh, I got to keep
insisting on, on specifying not skunk one
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know that's all people are going
to hear and think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we, we could clarify that too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't post on IG very much,
but I kind of posted a couple of times
[SPEAKER_06]: last week cause I got all mad about
something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, cause this, this idiot blocked me for
voicing my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh, basically like the, you can,
you can actually like look for a longer
[SPEAKER_06]: thing on my, on my, uh, my, my post or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically when Sam, the skunk man got
skunk, one, it was super skunky according
[SPEAKER_06]: to Sam, according to Sam, it reeked.
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't matter how you grew it,
who grew it, where you grew it,
[SPEAKER_06]: what you fed it, what environmental
conditions you had it in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, he, it was all skunky and he
didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he spent from 75, according to him
to the mid eighties doing everything he
[SPEAKER_06]: could to get that skunk smell out of skunk
one, because he didn't like the high,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, nearly, and he didn't like the flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So then he took some, some still slightly
skunky skunk one to Amsterdam and kept
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding it to sweet citrus floral
everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for the last 30 years, every four or
five years, uh, people come up and they
[SPEAKER_06]: say, I've got this old, rare, special
secret skunk one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're pretty much, you're going to
find what you want in that skunk one.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're gonna, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And instead of just saying, Oh,
it's Sam skunk one that, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: gypsy Nirvana couldn't give away,
or I got it from seeds men, or I got it
[SPEAKER_06]: from the flying Dutchman.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it from a million places.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause everyone sells skunk one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still sells it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Never stopped selling it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Never stopped selling it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the most common weed strain in weed
to this day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because a bunch of Americans aren't
growing, it doesn't mean it's the most
[SPEAKER_06]: common thing out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they crossed it to everything in the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything was, some female by skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the most common thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that skunk one produces citrus and
floral, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes cheesy and grape and grape,
you know, and never anything skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: No burnt rubber, no burnt tires,
no rank, no nothing that Sam spent 15,
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 years of his life doing his damnedest
to make.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure it didn't smell like that ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he did a really, and he did a really
good job.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was, did the best job.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now it's like, I mean, I don't want
real, I'm not really trying to like call
[SPEAKER_06]: it out or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, like for instance,
uh, when, um, when the swamp boys first
[SPEAKER_06]: came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, uh, they, they, they had a
couple of different plants that they bred
[SPEAKER_06]: to everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of them was skunk one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But rather than calling it, Oh,
we got some skunk one.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, Oh, we got the skunky thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We call it orange.
[SPEAKER_06]: Blossom trail.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's got notes of sweet citrus and
it's an old Florida skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, skunk one throws citrus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they got some skunk one.
[SPEAKER_06]: They found a good male.
[SPEAKER_06]: They, you know, they crossed it to things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Todd, who I got into an argument with
is trying to sell ancient skunk one beans
[SPEAKER_06]: and, and, and hope.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's, and he's trying to sell hope
that you're going to find that lost skunk
[SPEAKER_06]: turp in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he saw it worked with, with,
with, uh, dominion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's like, I'm going to do it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wait, your audio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you guys still hear not so?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you are.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm back.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so that's, that's the same thing too,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where it's like, we should maybe,
we don't have to talk about the whole
[SPEAKER_06]: thing, but we can talk about something
pretty basic is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, Duke came out with this ancient
Virginia skunk from the mountain man of
[SPEAKER_06]: the Hills.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these guys bred for SSC.
[SPEAKER_06]: They, these guys bred skunk for SSC.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were the American breeders for SSC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that, you know, and that he inherited
these, these beans from his uncle.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is what he started, you know,
dominion seeds and crossing everything
[SPEAKER_06]: too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So later on, Matt and I got the
opportunity, which I think was super cool
[SPEAKER_06]: to talk to the head guy from SSC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we got a, I don't know if a bunch of
people put that together, but like we got
[SPEAKER_06]: to ask him directly, did you ever work
with any Americans?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did any, did you do any breeding in
America?
[SPEAKER_06]: Were there any people breeding for you in
America and sending you seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, where did you get skunk one?
[SPEAKER_06]: So and so did you have people from
America, even mailing seeds, all kinds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said never no, didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all skunk one comes from Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that specifically all his
skunk one came directly from Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: All his skunk one came directly from Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I don't know, I don't know
where, um, I don't know where Duke got his
[SPEAKER_06]: skunk one, but it's all the same skunk
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no secret breeder for skunk one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It all, you people who breed, who,
who have skunk one, they bought kilos from
[SPEAKER_06]: Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sam would, would not sell to the public.
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't want to have what happened in
Neville.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and so, but he would wholesale to
other retailers in Holland because that
[SPEAKER_06]: was legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because seed sales were legal.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he would wholesale his, he gave a ton
of seed to Positronix and to Neville and
[SPEAKER_06]: SSC and later to the Flying Dutchman and
I'm sure Seed's Men and so on and so on
[SPEAKER_06]: and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everyone tries to claim that they have
some ancient, rare, oh, we've got the Sam
[SPEAKER_06]: skunk one from before it wasn't skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before Sam even touched that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we've got that.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, and then, you know, you got
this, you got whatever his ass name is
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking Leo Stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Claiming that like, oh, they've got,
they've got skunk bud from, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: from brickweed that got sent to France in
71, four or five years before Sam even
[SPEAKER_06]: started working on skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: French invention, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, I mean, you know what
brickweed sent to Europe was?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was probably Colombian or Mexican.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody was making hybrids in a homegrown
and bricking it up and mailing it across
[SPEAKER_06]: the ocean.
[SPEAKER_06]: So everyone tries to come out with these
ancient, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he did.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said it came from his fam, you know,
and his uncle and all that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: and so I'm not trying to, I'm not trying
to diss anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying to, I'm just trying to
like straight say that all these different
[SPEAKER_06]: people say they have rare, unusual secret
skunk one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all the same skunk one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all citrus, you know, cheese,
floral, grape, you know, people breed with
[SPEAKER_06]: it because it may, it improves bud
structure and it improves calyx to leaf
[SPEAKER_06]: ratio.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes plants look decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's decent, especially if you haven't
ever experienced skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure, I'm sure it's unique and decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's in so many lines today.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a revelation because when Sam
brought it to Europe, it was bred true for
[SPEAKER_06]: any number of different traits and you can
get four or five pounds off it in a
[SPEAKER_06]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were dealing with all these weird
sativas and all these things that didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: want to finish in their area.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was Northern Europe and shitty.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he brought skunk one there and it
literally was a revolution.
[SPEAKER_06]: But people acting like skunk one,
is there some secret skunk one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone using skunk one is using the
absolute most common, oldest breeding
[SPEAKER_06]: technique in the book, which is consumers
like buds that have nice bud structure and
[SPEAKER_06]: nice calyx to leaf ratio.
[SPEAKER_06]: Skunk one does this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take a male skunk one,
and I'm going to cross it to everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I got to concoct some rare
special story so people don't see it as
[SPEAKER_06]: the same shit that everyone else has been
doing for forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the seed business, folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how it runs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, that's the seed business.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you got to add floral language to
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so right now, Todd is trying to make
it seem like the same skunk one that's
[SPEAKER_06]: been available from Sam to everyone is
some rare and unusual and secret skunk
[SPEAKER_06]: that's been released from the 80s.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all from the same dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably the same shit that's in
your cookies, that's in a shirt,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in all of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been from the same dude forever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it's not from the same dude,
it's because somebody bought a bunch of
[SPEAKER_06]: that dude's stuff and bred it themselves
just to make more seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they didn't do anything specific to
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all skunk one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so one thing we do know about skunk
one is that there's all kinds of people we
[SPEAKER_06]: know that have ran large amounts of skunk
one, hunting for skunk one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they just don't exist.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is some stuff that there was some
things in the 80s that people got that
[SPEAKER_06]: they crossed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even in the 80s, they never got skunk
one to be skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had to cross it to something else to
get it to pop.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was also skunky to get that skunk turk
to pop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Neville took skunk one and threw it
on maple leaf and he got super skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there was a few different things
in the 90s, but now it's like people are
[SPEAKER_06]: just, it's like the same, you know,
I don't, it's like fashion or whatever,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the same regurgitated shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, Oh, there's a new
generation that doesn't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's resell them the exact same thing,
but let's butter it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's cool though, is that now with so
many more people making seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: so many more people able to grow instead
of it being like a cycle of every 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: five years, now it's like every two years,
every one year, every six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was that, and there was that
guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was this?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even want to say his name with
blue or Scott.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, there's, there's other people out
there that, that sell, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's another guy that, that had uncle
Fester skunk, everyone, all these,
[SPEAKER_06]: all these rare skunks, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: All this, you know, you're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Skunk one is that, but I've got this one
hook that gave me this ancient rare skunk
[SPEAKER_06]: one, but from before it went fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to sell it to you now before
it went to Amstergan.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's, it's, so the, the sulfur,
someone's asking about the sulfur talk,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, uh, Todd McCormick made this post that
maybe people, uh, weren't getting skunky
[SPEAKER_06]: smells anymore because they weren't using
sulfur burners as much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause people don't use sulfur burners
anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of took it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of took it as like a bunch of
people were buying his skunk and not
[SPEAKER_06]: finding any skunk and getting upset about
it because it's not in skunk one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he's trying to ruminate on what
could be the difference, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not like any of the skunk one
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the other thing people should know
is that, uh, Sam skunk man has been on
[SPEAKER_06]: every fucking forum since forum started
for weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis world overgrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see mag.
[SPEAKER_06]: He named it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has been spouting his version of events
for like 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been writing it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's no secret.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can add the dude himself will sit
there and lay out exactly what he did and
[SPEAKER_06]: why and why you won't find what you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But people want to make it.
[SPEAKER_06]: People want to make it seem like that's,
and that's what's kind of coming right now
[SPEAKER_06]: is everyone was like five, 10,
15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw a buddy joke that like, uh,
you couldn't give away gypsy Nirvana skunk
[SPEAKER_06]: one seeds 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he couldn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Couldn't give them away because people
knew what they were.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were like, no, I don't really
want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean that's, but, but that's what,
that's what's happening is now,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, you can, you can segue to it or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's the same thing with sour.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same, like all these old things
that have name recognition, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: people don't have personal experience with
them are going to repackaged and
[SPEAKER_06]: unscrupulous people are going to like,
you know, sell you hopes and dreams,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's a big part of it is,
is, is they're relying on people not to
[SPEAKER_00]: have had experience with it in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and they're relying on all this
knowing that it's very likely a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people aren't going to have that
experience with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how the fuck are you going to tell
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's never stopped existing
in the seed world.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they, uh, you know, and,
and just, just so people know,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's like, I see people saying we should
talk about that too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Running Todd's purest Indica and L5.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, we, uh, I shouldn't say we,
uh, Matt did an interview, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: with, uh, with the guy, basically the head
guy that kind of created NL and his group
[SPEAKER_06]: of friends and his group of friends and
his little group of growers or whatever,
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of is the reason why NL is so famous.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they sent Neville and Sensei a bunch
of seed and the rest is kind of history.
[SPEAKER_06]: And after, um, I believe it was after,
after he did that interview with you,
[SPEAKER_06]: he found some seed and he sent some seed
to you, right, Matt directly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he also sent some seed to Todd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the same time, at the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, um, you know, it's not Todd's
anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Todd got it sent to him from, you know,
Todd got it sent to him from Greg,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and the stuff that, that,
uh, CSI and Matt and, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: the kind of little collab thing that's
been going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, that's all the same seed stock that
Todd got.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but we, we got it from the same,
we got it from the same person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main thing was that like,
it seemed like there was going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: race to pop them, to get them out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make sure that they could all
be popped at, at one time, because why
[SPEAKER_00]: just look through four or five in your
closet and then do a repo from that when
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do, you know, 80 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to wait until it was,
uh, it was time until we had the space to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, CSI Humboldt provided that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and luckily we pulled it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And CSI, you know, he's really
experienced.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a really good numbering system.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a really good note taking system.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a really good way of identifying,
you know, different traits and different
[SPEAKER_06]: things that might be of interest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, you know, yeah, the, someone just
talked about, could you talk about the
[SPEAKER_06]: gypsy Nirvana era?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, that whole, that, that whole movie and
just that whole era, that's probably a
[SPEAKER_06]: whole show in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a wild show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a, that's a wild show, but even his
era and everything that was going on then,
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you could talk for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, there was a lot going on then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could, we could bring time era on for
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he was, you know, involved heavily
into that stuff at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be a good one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody said the only time I ever got a
sandalwood smell was there was this AK 47
[SPEAKER_06]: that was sent around the Colorado area and
the nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it smelled extremely strong of
sandalwood.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, our buddy crybaby could probably pop
in and, and tell us what terpenes that is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I'm, I'm old and I don't, I don't have
whatever that is memorized, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have any terpene, anything
memorized myself either, but I have some
[SPEAKER_06]: of it memorized.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that turpentine smells like Jack
and, and, uh, and witch hazel and train
[SPEAKER_06]: wreck and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so, um, people are saying,
and I'll, so.
[SPEAKER_06]: NL is like, NL is super famous because
Neville and Sensi, you know, but basically
[SPEAKER_06]: Neville made it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he took Seattle, Greg seeds and grew up
a bunch of them and released multiple
[SPEAKER_06]: wines and then a whole bunch of hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he released NL one and NL two pure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he found one female that was like
a throwback plant of NL five and that NL
[SPEAKER_06]: five mother cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you will, uh, he used extensively.
[SPEAKER_06]: He crossed it to Hayes.
[SPEAKER_06]: He crossed it to skunk one.
[SPEAKER_06]: He crossed it to NL two.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it was in the poly, a lot of the poly
hybrids he sold.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it kind of bubbled up and got super
famous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Steve Murphy was involved with NL in
the sense that his Afghani seeds given to
[SPEAKER_06]: Greg is the beginning of NL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the story behind that was,
um, a lady that Steve Murphy knew went
[SPEAKER_00]: through the hippie hash trail,
through the mountains of Pakistan and
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanistan and collected seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't really know if it's an
Afghani or a Paki to be sure, but she's
[SPEAKER_00]: the one who brought them back for Steve
Murphy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave some of those seeds out and
they made their way into the NL,
[SPEAKER_06]: the base for NL, the base for NL.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, yeah, I mean, and then those guys
all got busted in the late eighties.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, Greg basically said if he hadn't
sent them to Europe, it probably all would
[SPEAKER_06]: have been lost.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, uh, Neville, Neville was
one of the only, only, only breeders
[SPEAKER_06]: selling seeds back then.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the stuff that he was selling became
immensely popular.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, you know, and then there was
other people, was it Dutch Passion that
[SPEAKER_06]: sold NL two was Oasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was other, there was,
you know, there was, there was other
[SPEAKER_06]: people that, that got Neville seeds or
sensey seeds and white labeled them or
[SPEAKER_06]: made their own crosses.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then, and so one thing that we
should say is skunk one and, and NL and
[SPEAKER_06]: all that is in almost everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in a lot of today's work.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just generations past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, that's kind of how I see it is
like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now skunk and haze are in so much,
so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's like, you might not,
you might people, younger people today
[SPEAKER_06]: might not have like much access to them
pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they, I mean, their grandchildren,
great grandchildren, poly hybrids from
[SPEAKER_06]: them are all over the place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their fingerprints are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, that's partially America's fault
because we give fucking nicknames to
[SPEAKER_06]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do.
[SPEAKER_06]: We give nicknames to everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you start giving nicknames to thing in
your crew and then only the nickname
[SPEAKER_06]: becomes known.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you don't know what seeds it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't know what it came from,
you know, I mean, so it's like,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can, we could, somebody asked about
the dog shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: The dog shit was, was called, uh,
the dog shit got named that in Oregon in
[SPEAKER_06]: Minnesota where it was popped.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was called electric Boogaloo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such a better name.
[SPEAKER_06]: Such a better name.
[SPEAKER_06]: Way, way cooler name.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's also very, very, very,
very likely that it's an NL five haze from
[SPEAKER_06]: the early nineties, but you buy some NL
five haze from the early nineties and you
[SPEAKER_06]: pop a seed and you like it and it gives
you a great buzz and you call it electric
[SPEAKER_06]: Boogaloo.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you send it out to Oregon and
some idiot calls it dog shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then now it's a dog shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona regenerative keeps asking about
granddaddy perp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the basic story of granddaddy perp is
that it's an Urkel, uh, hybrid or rename,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it came from Ken or whoever else,
um, the, the surviving cuts all are based
[SPEAKER_00]: on Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people that have both cuts chose
to go with the original, which was Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, that's, that's just a rough
rundown.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's, there's something,
I mean, there's a lot more I could add to
[SPEAKER_06]: that one, but one of the things
interesting about it is that for as
[SPEAKER_06]: popular as Urkel became, there's,
I mean, there's people out there that want
[SPEAKER_06]: to claim the mantle, but there really
still isn't a verifiable, believable Urkel
[SPEAKER_06]: origin story.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there isn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's one of the few cuts that got that
famous that like the, the story,
[SPEAKER_06]: or, you know, information hasn't,
hasn't popped up, you know, it really is
[SPEAKER_06]: still a mystery.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's been people like CSI and
myself and others who have literally been
[SPEAKER_06]: hunting for what it is for 20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of claimants, but none of
them hold any gas.
[SPEAKER_06]: It hasn't seemed to hold.
[SPEAKER_06]: It hasn't seemed to hold any water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that, that when, you know,
when, uh, when, when Urkel came out and
[SPEAKER_06]: became super famous, that was like the,
what I call the purple craze, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that Urkel granddaddy purple,
grape ape, purple dragon, um, all that,
[SPEAKER_06]: all that different types of stuff,
my Mendo perps, all that stuff became
[SPEAKER_06]: super famous.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of those names, I'm sure renames,
some of them are bag seeds because that's
[SPEAKER_06]: how it goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, some of them are just,
well, you know, if I call it great,
[SPEAKER_06]: babe, I can claim it as my groups.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can take it down to, you know,
and back then it was like all that we was
[SPEAKER_06]: going through a lot of the dispensaries in
the Bay area, just limitless amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trap mouth glass pointed out there's
skunk in S1 progeny of Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, uh, yeah, even, even if you have
the clone or some of the hybrids or S1s in
[SPEAKER_00]: veg, if you take cuts of it, it smells
like skunk spray everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it doesn't pop up very regularly,
but it is definitely in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I mean, at the time that it
was found, I mean, it kind of,
[SPEAKER_06]: it kind of, kind of started spreading a
lot in the early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right on the tail end of all that
skunk and everything, skunk one and
[SPEAKER_06]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it wouldn't be surprising at all that
it would have, you know, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_06]: poly hybrid or whether it's a skunk one or
a skunk one hybrid that got mixed to
[SPEAKER_06]: something local up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's one of the few strains that got
that famous that like, there really hasn't
[SPEAKER_06]: been a verifiable story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the only thing actually accurate
that I've ever heard about it that sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate at least is that it's Paki skunk
one or Afghani skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could, I could totally see it,
you know, but, um, that, that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's trailed along with it all
throughout its little life, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what people say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just interesting that they,
we got that much.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of stuff we could,
we could go into, uh, into, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: well thought out hypotheticals.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a deep one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's a difference between,
and I try to like, I try when I talk to
[SPEAKER_06]: people to like differentiate when I'm,
I think I'm talking in like actual fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you're venturing into like
educated guesses or what the plants told
[SPEAKER_06]: you, or you're stringing together a story
from bits and pieces that you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, um, I mean, definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the guy said there's definitely
Afghan, like it definitely doesn't have
[SPEAKER_06]: very much stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Urkel, Urkel was always one of those
ones where you get it to about the size
[SPEAKER_06]: you want it to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you flip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's not gonna, it's not gonna grow
all that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite Urkel hybrids has
always been the, um, the Urkel trade dog
[SPEAKER_00]: that high and lonesome did.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was so much skunkiness in that
fucking line.
[SPEAKER_00]: He killed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He, uh, uh, CSI has one, I mean,
uh, TK by Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what that T 1000.
[SPEAKER_06]: Came from or whatever, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that stuff added the little bit of
potency and, and, you know, a little
[SPEAKER_06]: different, a little different kick to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked that one quite a bit, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, but yeah, I mean, it,
what irritates me is that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: like, I don't even know how to put it,
but the weed game seems like it reinvents
[SPEAKER_06]: itself every five or 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so as a result of that, you keep
getting, and this is what makes Matt so
[SPEAKER_06]: mad is you keep getting people coming out
with the same tired scams, but ready for a
[SPEAKER_06]: new batch of people that haven't heard him
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the same bullshit stories.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's some people, I mean,
there was, there was some shit somebody
[SPEAKER_06]: posted New York city kid or whatever that
that dude's had like nine different
[SPEAKER_06]: monikers and he's still around spewing,
spewing bull on various, on various
[SPEAKER_06]: aspects of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just want to say my favorite,
my favorite was when he pretended to be an
[SPEAKER_00]: old lady who was married to a man who just
passed that carried the Asian fantasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my favorite NYC kid one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, yeah, you know, rascal,
there's an era there from like,
[SPEAKER_06]: like that was more Matt's era than mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I was having kids and wrapped up and
living in the Hills then, but rascal and
[SPEAKER_06]: oh eight, oh nine, 10, 11, like he put out
a bunch of fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like rascal, I, you know, it's a shame he
still doesn't too much, but he had a three
[SPEAKER_06]: or four or five year period there where
everything he was releasing was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was one of the, he was one of the
first people along with Matt and a few
[SPEAKER_06]: others who was actually successfully
reversing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he, I don't know if he gets enough
credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he predated me too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he was, he was an, he was an early wave
of revolutionizing how we breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people found a lot of fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of his lines from back then
manic.
[SPEAKER_06]: You still got, you still got some rascal
gear.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Matt, Matt and I actually,
it was probably six or seven months ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were looking through, uh, um,
we were looking through a seed list of a
[SPEAKER_06]: friend of mine who was getting rid of his
seed freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, it was basically all from say,
Oh seven to 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Roughly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was roughly all right in that range.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was amazing how little of any of
those things you could still buy today
[SPEAKER_06]: from anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of that's gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of that was, and that's only 10
years, 10, 12 years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you go back another five or 10
years and that stuff's gone and you go
[SPEAKER_06]: back in the nineties and that shit's gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so yeah, rascal, I give him a bunch of
credit, um, because you know, he bred a
[SPEAKER_06]: bunch of fire and he was one of the first
people to kind of start the new Asian
[SPEAKER_06]: fantasy is some shit that Jason King put
in his Canna Bible.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said it was one of the best strains
he'd ever smoked and it was a crazy
[SPEAKER_06]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that Canna Bible entry and how
highly he talked about it created a
[SPEAKER_06]: massive demand for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was unique looking.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that created a forum and internet scam
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with HP 13 and everything else.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, that kind of thing,
like back before IG and all that,
[SPEAKER_06]: like the forums, um, you know,
that was the, that was where you scammed
[SPEAKER_06]: people over the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, so there was a lot of Asian
fantasy rumors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Asian fantasy is, is one of those weird
things where everybody that talks about
[SPEAKER_06]: it, nobody's really smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only person I know who's actually
smoked Asian fantasy and knows the one guy
[SPEAKER_00]: who's kept it and is going to die with it
is Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he knows the dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently obviously Jason King smoked
it and loved it enough to write like super
[SPEAKER_06]: eloquent, you know, write ups about how
amazing it was, but then that dude
[SPEAKER_06]: wouldn't share it either.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and that's really what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like every five or 10 years,
everything that was available isn't
[SPEAKER_06]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people are talking about Top Dog
and the Blue Asian in fairness,
[SPEAKER_00]: NYC kids scammed a lot of people and he
was the guy who scammed with the Blue
[SPEAKER_00]: Asian.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, it happened to everyone during
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was friends with the dude for
like two or three years and he pulled the
[SPEAKER_00]: long con, so it could happen to anyone,
especially during those times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody gets, I mean, one of the things
about cannabis is that since it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: documented very well, most of it,
um, you know, you, you can walk out of
[SPEAKER_06]: the, of the shadows and start claiming a
bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, my uncle's grooves,
Super City of the seed club skunk one and
[SPEAKER_06]: bred for them in the eighties in the Hills
of Virginia.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I found Asian fantasy and we did this
or I, you know, you just, whatever story
[SPEAKER_06]: there's still today, people, um,
walking out with stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause who's gonna, and they don't even
care if 10% of us know it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, Leo stone's the perfect
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to use a name, just couldn't
give less of a fuck that it doesn't align
[SPEAKER_00]: with history and that a lot of people are
going to know he's a liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to know that most people won't
be able to counter that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That guy said it straight up and he was
totally accurate in what he said.
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because his, his seed releases sell out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he has a goal.
[SPEAKER_06]: He reaches that goal.
[SPEAKER_06]: The haters or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even like that term really,
but like all the, all the, all the people
[SPEAKER_06]: that call them out and all the bullshit
and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, uh, he doesn't care because
it drives drama and he sells out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there was this thing the other day
where, you know, uh, he came out with,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, like his stupid sour diesel
cross that's full of shit or whatever,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was like limited to three.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says it all over it limited to 300
packs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then this guy gets a, gets a pack and
it's like, you know, stamped number three
[SPEAKER_06]: 99.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so I mean, it, it just is,
uh, we're right for scammers and we're
[SPEAKER_06]: right for selling legends and selling
hope, you know, and you know, Todd
[SPEAKER_06]: McCormick or whatever he does get,
he does get his seeds from real people.
[SPEAKER_06]: He just doesn't add any of the nuance to
it that you think people would want.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, uh, he just wants you to believe
it's like, like walking into the seed bank
[SPEAKER_06]: in 1986 and plopping down money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing when obviously it's not one
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm going to, uh, give this to Benny
bag of beans in the next two minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else wants to get on it,
it's, uh, uh, the banana Thai F ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the juicy fruit cross to platinum
banana or GBX one and the perfect Pearl
[SPEAKER_00]: cross to blue bonnet, which is the silver
berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to get on it, get on it
now, or I'm just going to, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: push it off in the next two minutes to
Betty and make sure everyone who's
[SPEAKER_06]: participated so far.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody is saying Todd is cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know Todd personally.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never had a cross.
[SPEAKER_06]: He might have issues or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I, you know, there's a lot of people
that know him or what.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just making a comment in the sense
that like you call your law, you call your
[SPEAKER_06]: seed company, authentic genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: You go to great pains to say it's all from
the original, the original lines from the
[SPEAKER_06]: original breeders.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you make a bunch of people think it's
like unchanged, kept by the right guys
[SPEAKER_06]: from the eighties and nothing ever
happened to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not the case.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, my biggest problem when we
first butted heads was the whole prop 64
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, which leads to where we're at now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like if we're dying,
our whole community's dying and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of that can be pointed back to
prop 64, which Todd was a big proponent of
[SPEAKER_00]: because he had a lot of rich friends and
he wanted to push that through.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Todd can, Todd can, uh,
Todd can talk about what a, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, a weed warrior he's been.
[SPEAKER_06]: And while I do have sympathy for anybody
who's been jailed or suffered,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, cause myself and others have all gone
through it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I didn't live in Beverly Hills at the
time, uh, nor did I move back to Beverly
[SPEAKER_06]: Hills when I was done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so there's a, there's a level of like
wealth there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have Woody Harrelson bailing
you out.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, I didn't live in Beverly Hills.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I didn't have any mansions for
the cause.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most people didn't have a mansions for the
cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they had trap houses and,
and you grew in shitty neighborhoods where
[SPEAKER_06]: they didn't want, but they didn't want to
bother you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause you weren't a problem and you grew
up, you grew on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you were on the outskirts.
[SPEAKER_06]: You grew on the edges.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, most people Mendo and
Humboldt became famous because it had a
[SPEAKER_06]: good climate, but also because people
could disappear into the Hills and get
[SPEAKER_06]: away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Oh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I didn't know if anybody had asked him
project seed monster, how many,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, males and females he used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his NL five reproduction line.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah, I've only heard.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll say this about that is that if you
want to get NL from Greg, then you can get
[SPEAKER_06]: it from Matt through CSI, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And CSI has whole pictures of his rooms,
breeding updates, this, that everything
[SPEAKER_06]: else.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all pretty well documented,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: And who knows how much or little Todd has
done.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you can, you can see how big,
uh, CSI did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you could see that he was
blowing off whole rooms and he's made
[SPEAKER_06]: selections and he's done all this
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, you know, we have a,
we have a mutual buddy that's pictures and
[SPEAKER_06]: pictures or it doesn't count.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, which I don't think is too true
when you go back far enough because it was
[SPEAKER_06]: risky then, but for now, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually doing a run of the clones
of the seed moms, even though we've
[SPEAKER_00]: already pollinated all and we kept clones
of every single male and female to see how
[SPEAKER_00]: they flower as clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that, you know, if we're saying
this one's going to be bubblegummy from
[SPEAKER_00]: this specific one, we'll know that it's
actually bubblegummy as a clone and can
[SPEAKER_00]: pass on said traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's, there's a lot more
involved that people have no clue about
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anybody is going to recreate
NL five haze.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I mean, it would be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing some interesting stuff,
but it would be nice straight NL five
[SPEAKER_00]: haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I don't think any of us are rocking
just straight original haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it would take a big pop of old
original haze in the first place to find a
[SPEAKER_00]: phenome worth breeding with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got to hope that it passes on
any of the traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we are doing some crosses with the
NL five stuff that will be similar to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to a NL five cross the NL five haze,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't even trying.
[SPEAKER_06]: To diss it because basically what you're
saying is, is cross a, an extreme sativa
[SPEAKER_06]: to an indica and hopefully find something.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just personally think that NL five haze
is probably the single most successful
[SPEAKER_06]: release seed line in history.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Toad has an original.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even start me on Mr. Toad.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, here, here, here's the thing
about original haze is that original haze
[SPEAKER_06]: is also not rare.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also easily available.
[SPEAKER_06]: It all comes from the same dude,
just like skunk one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It comes from Sam skunk man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he has sold kilos of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You used to be able to buy pure haze F 10
in the nineties from the flying Dutchman.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they would have big write-ups on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get pure haze from seeds men.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could get pure haze from all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it's not rare.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not hard to find.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, what is hard to find is it does seem
that the haze seeds that Neville got and
[SPEAKER_06]: positron conics got and, uh, uh,
SSSC got in the mid eighties, they found
[SPEAKER_06]: phenos that were much easier to create
quality with than after Sam had done
[SPEAKER_06]: multiple OPs, open pollinations.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a, you know, you could like,
I'm not what Matt is basically saying is
[SPEAKER_06]: that the amount of work it would,
it would take to find the type of haze
[SPEAKER_06]: that's that Neville found is really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because open pollination is a great thing,
but it really opens it up, which means you
[SPEAKER_06]: have to hunt through so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that scabby and white Buffalo
have some really good hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been showing off and, uh,
crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that maybe, maybe that'll be a
cool project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use one of their, their hay selections and
cross with the NL five.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a definite possibility.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tom, Tom Hills hazes from positronic
stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Danny, we are bidding on the,
the banana tie F one and the silver
[SPEAKER_00]: berries right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody said, what is super skunk?
[SPEAKER_06]: Super skunk was a very skunky skunk one
male that Neville crossed to Maple Leaf
[SPEAKER_06]: Indica, a Fino he called Afghan T and it
became probably the best selling thing at
[SPEAKER_06]: his company.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then later at Sensi.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was the line that popped all the
skunk turps that everybody dreams about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: For lack of a better way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a, is there a Neville's hay
selection, Neville selection of Neville's
[SPEAKER_00]: haze in the U S?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, some people have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure not the one that I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will tell people if they want to talk
about Neville's haze for a second is that
[SPEAKER_06]: there is a Neville's haze Fino,
um, that still floats around Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is by far the strongest sativa I have
ever encountered.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it Neville's haze, especially the
older Neville's haze has like some effects
[SPEAKER_06]: in it that I, that are super uncommon in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it's incredibly potent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I hunted for mine myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, uh, we have a buddy of ours on
her dire wolf is on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: He got some, some, uh, Neville's haze in
the late nineties and he made bubble hash
[SPEAKER_06]: or something like that, that like lasted
him 10 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: This stuff is wicked potent.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's anxiety inducing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Fort Collins cough is in the room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The cough is, uh, I used to grow the
cough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I used to grow the cough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, that's why I say that I think NL five
haze is the, is probably the most
[SPEAKER_06]: successful line ever released because
there's probably seven to 10 Finos of it
[SPEAKER_06]: that still exist.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's the cough, there's dog
shit, there's, um, C five, there's the
[SPEAKER_06]: piff, there's Cuban black.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I mean, you can go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's endless real.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the endless.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's, and then there's a bunch
of stuff for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there's like, there's probably more
Finos of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most things you're lucky if one Fino of a
line from that old survived.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And NL five haze has like fricking,
like I said, you know, it's probably got
[SPEAKER_06]: double digit elite Finos that are like 30
years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snow high as much as, um, I've butted
heads with him over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a fucking amazing, amazing double
say he's got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he still holds it or not,
but if, uh, people that are looking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: good devil's haze, if he has some of those
crosses out there, he had a purple's
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's haze mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just the both selections are
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's, it's, it's got, you know,
it's one of those things where when you
[SPEAKER_06]: cross two marijuana strains that are very
unlike one another, you can get some
[SPEAKER_06]: unique combinations of potency,
Terps growth, all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't heard that trout mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll look into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, yeah, that would suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, seed breeders and old
schoolers and stuff were like a can
[SPEAKER_06]: tanker.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're like a difficult bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, every generation has a group
that doesn't get along.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you can go back and people will
be battling each other on forums and you
[SPEAKER_06]: know, people have strong held beliefs,
you know, uh, I mean, Tom Hill is an
[SPEAKER_06]: amazing contributor to cannabis,
but boy was that too tough to get along
[SPEAKER_06]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's complex.
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely don't want to get on his
wrong side, you know, uh, cause you'd take
[SPEAKER_06]: your head off, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so I don't know, but yeah,
I mean it, it, uh, um, I don't have any
[SPEAKER_06]: idea, uh, what I know top dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all, we both know top dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what he's specifically using
on anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, aces, uh, used to be a lot more
reputable.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have, they have some shadiness to
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but it's indisputable that,
uh, there's some dudes in Europe and
[SPEAKER_06]: others that gave them real cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got that real cut of Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just talking about, they have the
real a five.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got the real, they got real cuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, there's definitely some junk,
uh, in their stuff, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how, that's just a part of using
haze.
[SPEAKER_06]: Karel does not have his haze still.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has, uh, 35 year old cut of his haze by
skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The skunk one haze.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he doesn't, he doesn't have any
original breeding hazes or anything like
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: There, it is possible that the haze see
exists, uh, which is Neville's old
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding male.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it's possible Shanti has it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's possible it's in Spain.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's impossible for us to so far get any,
um, verification other than them saying it
exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, this is a good point on a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get this straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville popped a handful of, of hay seeds
and found multiple gems in a, in a bag
[SPEAKER_00]: from Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but you, but you think Sam's opeing
that line made it harder to find keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of those, um, enigmas of haze,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said before, opeing,
uh, you can lose it too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can, you can OP and OP open
pollination for, for, for anybody that
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't know open pollination is basically
taking males and females of the same line
[SPEAKER_06]: and breeding them together using no
selection and just trying to preserve as
[SPEAKER_06]: much genetic diversity as you can.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Sam has been very clear over the years
for some stupid fucking reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: He never did selective breeding with haze.
[SPEAKER_06]: Never.
[SPEAKER_06]: He just decided to continually open
pollination.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it seems like, uh, and you know,
we actually learned some pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting stuff, um, from Correll in
that, uh, Sam probably didn't have that
[SPEAKER_06]: many hayseeds when he came over because he
gave, according to Correll, he gave,
[SPEAKER_06]: he only gave 10 or 15 to, to positronics.
[SPEAKER_06]: He only got 10 ish Neville only like there
was, you know, so maybe he only brought
[SPEAKER_06]: over some and he kept some from Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had some from himself and it does seem
like that everyone that got those original
[SPEAKER_06]: hayseeds from Sam before he had a chance
to do anything with them in Europe,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's where all the haze comes from
pretty much for whether it's positronics,
[SPEAKER_06]: positronics is where Tom Hill or old
timers haze comes from.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Correll had some Neville had
some Sam still did open pollinate,
[SPEAKER_06]: but then no one has really found any
elites or anything from those open
[SPEAKER_06]: pollinations that they bred into things to
my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying it's not in there,
but when you have a situation where most
[SPEAKER_06]: of the line is going to go 16 to 24 weeks
and they're admitting that 80% of it is
[SPEAKER_06]: junk and 10% of it is nice and 10% is
special.
[SPEAKER_06]: Finding that 10% that's special is hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Finding a breeding male that is going to
pass those special traits is even fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they got lucky for lack of a
better term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And realistically Neville with whatever he
was given, he obviously did a better
[SPEAKER_00]: selection based on either luck,
chance or what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, and the continuous open
pollination with Sam basically opened the
[SPEAKER_00]: line up so much you will not run into the
same phenotype like that very often,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why you're probably seeing a high
amounts of variation and not running into
[SPEAKER_00]: the keepers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's, there's another interesting
thing that we should maybe say too,
[SPEAKER_06]: when it comes to that is that there's also
a theory that a lot of the euros didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: like haze by skunk one because they
thought the skunk turps dominated the haze
[SPEAKER_06]: cross and also skunk one is primarily
sativa.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was a sativa leaning plant crossed
with a pure sativa.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people think that the reason why
Neville had such success with it is
[SPEAKER_06]: because he was able to cross it to very
different Indica's G 13 Northern lights
[SPEAKER_06]: and a lot of his most famous hash plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's phenos of those that all
there's there's hash plant haze G 13 haze
[SPEAKER_06]: and L five haze.
[SPEAKER_06]: They all still exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of it could be that he just had
some nicer Afghans that blended better.
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be it too.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's people that believe that pretty
strongly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that maybe the things he was
crossing it to was just nicer,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and it's also possible,
you know, we don't have a lot of,
[SPEAKER_06]: we don't have a lot of, uh, I mean,
do we have a bunch of cross-referencing
[SPEAKER_06]: from Sam's early era, Matt, you know,
of just about what he was up to and what
[SPEAKER_06]: he was doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that was one of the most,
the longest running and most angry part of
[SPEAKER_06]: the forums.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember when he was know it all for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a few names.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had a few different names and people
would argue over whether or not he was the
[SPEAKER_06]: neighbor to the Hayes brothers,
what he knew, whether it was true,
[SPEAKER_06]: the one guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it makes sense because back then only
your good friends would know you were
[SPEAKER_06]: growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Rob Clark, who I respect a lot backs
him up, but they've been best buddies for
[SPEAKER_06]: 40 years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, um, there's people that think
that he stumbled upon skunk one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was already kind of mixed and he just
kind of finished it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, he claims he started it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have his version of events,
you know, um, and we don't have,
[SPEAKER_06]: we don't, you know, there might be other,
there might be other aspects of it,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it could be even that, you know,
Hayes and skunk had similar ancestors
[SPEAKER_06]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Hayes was pure Colombian.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and so maybe it didn't cross as
well as the pure Afghans.
[SPEAKER_06]: Neville and Shanti did make super sober
Hayes together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I could tell that story because it's
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, when Neville was in jail in 1990,
somebody grew out some, uh, NL some NL
[SPEAKER_06]: five by skunk Hayes seeds, NL five Hayes
by skunk Hayes seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they found this crazy Fino that became
super popular in Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when he got out of jail, he started
breeding it and, uh, he wanted to find,
[SPEAKER_06]: he was trying to blend the three most
famous European, you know, seed bank lines
[SPEAKER_06]: together.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Northern lights, skunk Hayes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was trying to find some combo,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And he wasn't that happy with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we bred it for four or five years or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Ben and Alan drunkers who own
Sensei, by that time he was working,
[SPEAKER_06]: he was their head breeder because they
bailed him out of jail and bought his
[SPEAKER_06]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, when he was in a tight spot,
which he had eternal resentment for,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, because basically it's like,
they kind of were like, we'll get you out
[SPEAKER_06]: of prison and get you back into Holland,
but you have to give us all your shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he, and then they hired him and he
went from being a business owner of the
[SPEAKER_06]: largest seed company in Holland to the
head breeder and had to give them all his
[SPEAKER_06]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, but be that as it may, um,
the first cannabis cup I went to in 1995
[SPEAKER_06]: was named after Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole thing was themed after the
emperor wears no clothes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jack was there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were doing all this shit about hemp
was going to save the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Ben and Alan drunkers being money
oriented Dutch people, they wanted to
[SPEAKER_06]: release a Jack Herrera strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they, uh, Sam Neville said it
wasn't ready.
[SPEAKER_06]: They said, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they released Jack Herrera,
which was his NL five Hayes by skunk Hayes
[SPEAKER_06]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, uh, after, um, after he left,
uh, after he broke up with Sensei and went
[SPEAKER_06]: on and did his own thing, he started
working with Shanti who was younger than
[SPEAKER_06]: him and probably a little bit more vibrant
and had a little bit more like verve to
[SPEAKER_06]: get going then than he did, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, he started, they started working under
greenhouse and they started breeding,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, a Hayes project, which after two or
three years of work, I think became super
[SPEAKER_06]: silver Hayes, mango Hayes and Neville's
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, super silver Hayes was Neville's
preference.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, mango Hayes was, um, Shanti's
preference.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, same, uh, same father, different
mother, uh, type of thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so half sisters, I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Neville's, Neville's Hayes was
only supposed to be a personal project,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was only supposed to be a personal
breeding project for his holy grail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grail that he never stopped chasing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, and that, uh, yeah, that holy
grail.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he, they found such fire in it at
first that they ended up releasing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and everybody that got those first few
years of releases, there was crazy Sativa
[SPEAKER_06]: power in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: In that weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was kind of the tail end of
Neville's kind of like, like intense
[SPEAKER_06]: contributions to breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mango Hayes, super silver Hayes and
Neville's Hayes were kind of like the last
[SPEAKER_06]: three big things that he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He did some small releases and some other
different things under some different
[SPEAKER_06]: groups and with some different help,
like from, uh, what's dude's name?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Kanga.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kanga.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he, you know, he, he definitely did
some stuff, but the last thing that really
[SPEAKER_06]: became like, like world famous,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like super silver.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fucking famous.
[SPEAKER_06]: It won like three cannabis cups in a row.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, you know, it was famous.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super famous.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about the out?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, the outback is, is another
one of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I mean, lots of people have the mango
Hayes top dog has mango Hayes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get mango Hayes still straight
from Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still available.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still available.
[SPEAKER_06]: Top dog is bread with some mango Hayes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, so, I mean, it's one of
those things where it's like, you just
[SPEAKER_06]: wonder do the parents, are the parents
still the same?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you don't get a lot of honesty.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, not with that dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not with any dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who the fuck is honest?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, which, which, like, tell me which,
which like guy has a fire line that got
[SPEAKER_06]: famous.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was like, oh yeah, that shit was
famous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I lost the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, American dudes, American dudes,
American dudes that are stupid as fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: admit that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the LA, the LA cut is definitely a
diesel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone's asking me if it's a sour cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was sold as sour in my area for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely diesel type.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I, I was hoping with, I don't even
want to say their name, but I was hoping
[SPEAKER_06]: with the scam each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was hoping that, you know, we would
finally, um, get to see relationships and
[SPEAKER_06]: see mom, dad, cousins, nephews,
aunts, uncles, and all that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it would like really clarify a bunch
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, you know, uh, what happened to my
dutted skunk six?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, that's a real shame.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in 2017, um, there was huge fires in my
area.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was sort of the start of the last four
or five years of every, every season has
[SPEAKER_06]: massive fires.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like the second or third biggest fire
in Mendo history took off and I got
[SPEAKER_06]: evacuated, uh, from my spot for about a
week and I lost all five skunk six moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, it was, that was a rough week.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very difficult.
[SPEAKER_06]: So fires, uh, you know, there's been
really bad fires the last four or five
[SPEAKER_06]: years up in Sonoma, Humboldt, Mendo,
uh, Trinity and, uh, Mandelbrot did have
[SPEAKER_06]: the rear.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a, that's another long story,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh, Mandel, I gave, I, I,
uh, yes, Mandelbrot, I gave Mandelbrot
[SPEAKER_06]: sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had real sour.
[SPEAKER_06]: He did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is skunk six also Humboldt Snow or is that
five?
[SPEAKER_06]: Skunk six is definitely not Humboldt Snow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, uh, that's skunk five.
[SPEAKER_06]: They called, they called Humboldt Snow
skunk five in Florida.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually, the girl who, uh, whose
boyfriend and her brought it out to
[SPEAKER_06]: California actually lives not very far
from me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they made it to Eugene in glassblower
circles and it was called snow.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people called it Eugene snow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause it was from those Eugene
glassblowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It got brought down to our buddy CSI.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you got it in Humboldt,
it was Humboldt snow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it went from skunk five to Eugene snow
to Oregon snow to Humboldt snow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And depending on who you got it from,
one of those names would be the name you,
[SPEAKER_06]: you attributed to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So is the rez cut is my headband is in the
root beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's such a fucking shenanigans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's what he says.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he tentative, he, he says that's the
cut that was used.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and I will, I will say that in some of
the hybrids that, that CSI released,
[SPEAKER_06]: people have found root beer turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: There have been some root beer turps that
have popped up in the LA TK and the LAD.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rez is a scumbag.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was an asshole as our buddy,
high and lonesome can attest.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was an asshole on the forums before all
the shenanigans happened with the police.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea if he had the real sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's on the East coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does have a lot of super skunk like
traits that come out of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't, I'm not even dissing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying that like, I didn't know
him back then.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I knew of him, you know,
but like we lived on different coasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's not like we were in the same
hood or the same homies or ever saw his
[SPEAKER_06]: grow room or I ever smoked any of his
fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Snow cap is not snow bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: Snow cap was a large yielding indica,
but it's not related to snow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a guy here saying multiple LA by D
phenos had root beer and as turps snow cap
[SPEAKER_06]: was being grown on any leps farm back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to live about a mile from Eddie
leps farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to go out there all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I stopped when he decided to buy seven
acres across in the 20 and higher
[SPEAKER_06]: allowations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was going to grow 32,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I told him, I'm like, dude,
if you do this, you know, the DEA is like
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh three, I think or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, they'll never let you get away
with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll never ever let you get,
you, you, they will come after you.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't let you get away with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they didn't, uh, he put out 32 or
33,000 plants and it was actually
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: The way he did it.
[SPEAKER_06]: People should know that he got medical
cards for every six plants and he had a
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking grid map.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had a map of his whole property where
you got a 10 by 10 and six plants and it
[SPEAKER_06]: was all numbered and every single one of
those 32,000 plants had a fucking medical
[SPEAKER_06]: card attached to it with six plants and a
10 by 10.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he had a plan to have these all up and
down California.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was going to be Eddie lap farms and
you are going to be able to, you can grow
[SPEAKER_06]: your legal six plants, but maybe you live
in a city and you can't, you can grow them
[SPEAKER_06]: out at Eddie's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you could, you could actually like at
Eddie leps farm, you could go out there
[SPEAKER_06]: and, um, you could go out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could default.
[SPEAKER_06]: He would do a certain amount of work and a
certain amount of basic food and this and
[SPEAKER_06]: that, you know, there's some shadiness to
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's, let's be real, but, uh,
you know, but you could, and he did give a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of stuff to patients and he got ego.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, he got kind of his ego into his head
and, uh, they busted him and he got 10
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: His wife died in prison, I believe with
cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then he got out and he was sick
and everybody was growing the size that he
[SPEAKER_06]: had the balls to grow and not getting in
trouble for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so he was, yeah, he used to live in
upper Lake.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I, I drive past his house that he used
to have awesome, uh, often up there on the
[SPEAKER_06]: Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, uh, and he, I still have signed
pictures of, cause back then a field a
[SPEAKER_06]: week ago, he'd was like, you had to be up
on spy rock or you had to be out somewhere
[SPEAKER_06]: in the sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: For someone to grow something like that,
you know, the real Trinity does have some
[SPEAKER_06]: pine nose.
[SPEAKER_06]: Skunk six was a thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Skunk six was the old super skunk cut that
got put into sour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it, it's a long story.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't, we don't chat about it here
right this minute, but skunk six and the
[SPEAKER_06]: super skunk cut that got brought West that
skunk VA post pictures of is the same
[SPEAKER_00]: plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like it was a super skunk
hybrid was the last, uh, it's basically
[SPEAKER_06]: the, the breeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a skunk hybrid that he crossed to a
bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's kind of a rainbow hippie and not the
most, uh, you know, a lot of these old
[SPEAKER_06]: timers, they're short on specifics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were doing a bunch of drugs and
partying and taking acid and tripping
[SPEAKER_06]: around and breeding things and not taking
notes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then some weed nerds 35 years later
are like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, 1988, you know, what number was
that?
[SPEAKER_06]: And people are like, oh man, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but, um, but what we do know is that
it was, it was, it was a skunk hybrid that
[SPEAKER_06]: he bred for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the final thing he did was he crossed
it to Neville super skunk from seed and
[SPEAKER_06]: the, the Fino number six got sold on dead
tour a whole bunch, uh, and got,
[SPEAKER_06]: went out to Colorado, came out to
California with us became very famous.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was only called skunk six by a
very, very small few groups.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, we never called it in fact,
there was multiple years of debate on
[SPEAKER_06]: whether or not the skunk six and the super
skunk were the same cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It took tracking him down and having him
confirm it because all the Cali people
[SPEAKER_06]: just called it super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then some of the Colorado people that
were like his old dead tour friends,
[SPEAKER_06]: some of them called it the six.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just that nickname shit again,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why aren't the NLs after five around if
they were made?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because uh, Greg didn't, Neville didn't
make use of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Greg explained it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Only the one and two were mostly Indica.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got progressively more sativa cause
they were rated on height.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the six, seven, eight,
nine, 10, 11 Neville just found to be a
[SPEAKER_06]: pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look back over his early shit in
like 86 and 87 and 88 or so, you can see
[SPEAKER_06]: NL nine and L eight.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see different ones, bread into
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I think by 89 or 90, he had
basically decided I'm going to use NL one,
[SPEAKER_06]: NL two and NL five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are the only ones that really
got, really got blended.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really all it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, he got them in 84 or 85 and he
fucked around them for four or five years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he settled on one NL five female.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe all the NL one and two he
used was male.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: For the most part.
[SPEAKER_06]: He used those as breeding kills.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to call this option pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, get in the bids.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying, I'm going to call it,
but, uh, get in your bed just in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: two minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I'll call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for the, uh, banana Thai F ones
and the silver berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else we got?
[SPEAKER_06]: Trinity was awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of this still has a big
ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cola of Trinity in their freezer from back
in the day to compare to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the hard part is all the people
that were involved with Trinity basically
[SPEAKER_06]: all lost it in the same two or three
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then by the time it floated back to
people 15 years later, there's half the
[SPEAKER_06]: crew thinks that it's real.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other half thinks it's even the
people that think it's not real.
[SPEAKER_06]: They think it's a close hybrid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's got Trinity and no one says it
doesn't have any Trinity in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a matter of, is it the cut?
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember, you know, and how is my memory
from 1999 to now?
[SPEAKER_00]: And God knows how much it's changed
environmentally since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's a really hard thing to line
up like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so, um, cat piss is still around
our buddy, uh, uh, 707 seed bank,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, has cat piss in his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that shoreline done outdoor is,
uh, phenomenally more cat piss than any
[SPEAKER_00]: other cat piss I've ever smelled,
including the San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing is so cat pissy, uh,
the outdoor grow of it that I have here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, and there's, there's different,
there's, there's more than one cat piss
[SPEAKER_06]: and the cat piss people do disagree on
what is cat piss.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some Pittsburgh cat piss and
there's NorCal cat piss.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the SoCal cat piss that he's,
that Matt's familiar with.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's debates around all that shit
too, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them are like super silver
haze types where the turpinoline kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: leans toward, uh, pissy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We still have the snow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember the snow.
[SPEAKER_06]: The snow came out of that same Trinity
came out of that same Eugene glassblower
[SPEAKER_06]: small circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, our buddy CSI has had the snow since
probably 98 ish and he breeds it in all
[SPEAKER_06]: kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the, the lineage on,
um, shoreline at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm, I'm like the last person to
get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems it's, it seems it's mysterious.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't, Albert Walker exists.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's around.
[SPEAKER_06]: It exists.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, and maybe I'll say this before we
get off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody that has anything old and rare,
don't get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, please don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, right now, especially with the way
pricing is and with, and with the
[SPEAKER_06]: pressures on the scene right now,
there's a real risk for a lot of cool
[SPEAKER_06]: genetic diversity to go by the wayside.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, because people might not have money or
might get into a bad spot and not,
[SPEAKER_06]: it might get worried about all this is I
can't even sell this for what I need.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's not even worth,
and then they just decide to get rid of
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, five, 10 years from
now, there's a bunch of shit that we wish
[SPEAKER_06]: still existed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you've got something that you love,
try to hold onto it because you might be
[SPEAKER_06]: one of the few people left that has,
you never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be one of those people that has
a contemporary line that's missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, 10 years from now,
15 years from now, if you love something,
[SPEAKER_00]: hold onto it tight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, dude, you're at three 70,
three 70.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Things are climbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're slowly climbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, uh, yeah, let's, let's,
let's end this option and then maybe I
[SPEAKER_00]: could do one more and we'll, um,
talk about the NL projects and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and kind of what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we are, I think we're going to
have some, uh, some not so as LA Cush
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed to NL five at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Maui too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been, you know, I, uh, the Maui is
he's had it for probably over a year.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a matter of making its way into
rotations and being crossed to things,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some really exciting ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The corn might be in there, which I think
would be an interesting cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the, the male NL five that we have as
our keeper so far is, is, uh, a spitting
[SPEAKER_00]: resemblance to the purple Indica,
which I think is fascinating since it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from the same area.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one's going to be also in the
rotation, seeing how that purple Indica
[SPEAKER_00]: lines up with that male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that'll be pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we, you have hope.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they're that LA that people have
been that LA coach by Kim D people have
[SPEAKER_06]: been finding killer stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great combo.
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like it seems like that one
really, that one really is like people
[SPEAKER_06]: send me pictures all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, we can, we can, we could maybe get
a PIP on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of these days, you know, he's a little
shy, but he's a good buddy of ours.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we could always ask him, you know,
right now is a tough time because,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the, the industry itself has changed
so rapidly in the past two years that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a real, it's a, it's a hard time to get
people excited about talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis when it's so, when the actual
scene is so depressing right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, um, and shout out to down with
dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just recently passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's going to be a lot more of that
going on and it's sad, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you knew him, send his family love.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's, that's actually something too
is like, there's a, not when I,
[SPEAKER_06]: what I just said about the clones,
but about seed making too, where like
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a lot of diversity at risk,
um, because people need to be able to make
[SPEAKER_06]: enough money to survive.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as things get more centralized and
more corporate and larger scale and a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of the small garage size grows and a lot
of the passion type people start getting
[SPEAKER_06]: pinched financially, it becomes a lot more
difficult to be like, Oh, should I
[SPEAKER_06]: dedicate this space to something that's
just for me or should I just grow the
[SPEAKER_06]: whole thing based on whatever my buddy
says he can get me for right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so a lot of experimentation,
um, a lot of experimentation is at risk
[SPEAKER_06]: because you've got to be surviving pretty
well to be experimenting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what Matt was just saying is that
there's a lot of people staring at
[SPEAKER_06]: survival.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't mean it won't like shift and
change, but right now there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: people that have gotten used to living a
certain way and making certain what and
[SPEAKER_06]: making money off a certain way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the weed game is dramatically
changing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's really dramatically
changing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, uh, the people that are taking it
over right now, they don't really care
[SPEAKER_06]: about diversity that much.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just, they just care about margin and
wanting to sell you some shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you could definitely lose a lot of shit
in the next five or 10 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, there's leaf irrigation in the
headband and the chem D.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not surprising you see it in the
progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you answer Dickie's question if L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush is a five fingered plant?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, that, that should vary,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It varies.
[SPEAKER_06]: It varies.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it, it, it, it's not specific.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a three finger, but it could
have, it could have five, seven,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, um, you know, there is,
that's, it's, I don't know that every,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a guy that said everything has OG
Kush camera cookies in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, even my cherry berry doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: AK 47 blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a bunch of stuff in this last blue
round to try to keep that from being the
[SPEAKER_00]: norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made a great attempt at it anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's true that a lot of stuff does,
but there still is, if you think about it,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a bunch of stuff that doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Cody?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a banana tie and the silver berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of what to put up
after this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to call it in a few
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying that, but it keeps going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to add something else in and
we'll call it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm throwing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: LA Kush has green leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I have, I have some pictures
posted on my page about, about it,
[SPEAKER_06]: various things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it's, I mean, the one thing I'll
say about diesels and LA and all that is
[SPEAKER_06]: that you are not identifying that shit by
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old timers Hayes does not predate Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam was the one who introduced Hayes to
the seed world period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he, he may not be a Hayes brother
per se, but he was the one who brought the
[SPEAKER_06]: seed line to the old timers comes from
posi, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Positronix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old timers has a different claim on
theirs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calling it, calling it, calling it
professor cube 390 writing it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to throw up the P 91 S
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just do a pack of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we'll sell for worth of
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me write this down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Professor Q 390.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the cherry Berry.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is silver Berry and then banana tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I put in bubble Berry V2 as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Q, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, now I'm going to put up the P 91
S ones, start them at 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and if you get them, you get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you that know P 91 is an old San
Diego cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I didn't make very many of the S ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only had to cut long enough to make S
ones and passed it out to a Canorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, uh, one of the third gen dudes and,
um, do you know type a two in Michigan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's some type of old super skunk
silver Pearl, maybe cross of some sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the, one of the original packs of
the S ones right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So $200.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll throw in some more shit with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can continue.
[SPEAKER_06]: I lost my train of thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just spaced out for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: I realized we like been talking for a
couple hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been trying to get Matt and a buddy
to talk about the bull rider cut,
[SPEAKER_06]: but, uh, yeah, it, um, see bull rider
predated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me in San Diego, by the time I got down to
San Diego, there was no bull rider to be
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked except for Afghani bull rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did have experience with the Afghani
bull rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the most dank cloud things
that ever smelled in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But trying to find the original bull rider
was just not happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a while ago, a buddy, gray skull,
um, sent me some seeds of the original
[SPEAKER_00]: bull rider bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was originally going to give it to
someone to tissue culture and thank the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, recently sent those back to,
uh, uh, gray skulls so he could have them
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, yeah, bull mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that was actually, it was called
bull Gani, I think is what they kept
[SPEAKER_00]: calling the Afghani bull rider up in Mendo
when they brought it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's my coverage on bull riders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably some kind of NL five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Betsy, it really is its sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and to be, um, compared to it,
I would guess like skunk one NL five
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes, something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, uh, Betsy still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And is held by friends, but we don't know
anybody that we know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about half goo either.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, um, um, pack has it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking love after we, I want to make
that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen that one in a long ass time
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you like it when you did?
[SPEAKER_06]: I did like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to have a train wreck
cross to it soon too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, a hogs breath question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was hogs breath?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was Tennessee hogs breath in San
Diego hogs breath yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that was a Adam Dunlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no such thing as a Tennessee
hogs breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hogs breath was a San Diego original.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one of my first mentors was the person
who bred it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, he passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, it was, God knows what it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said so many different things that it
could have been just keeping people on
[SPEAKER_00]: their toes, but it was fucking day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very like cheesy toe funk fucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of sweet depending on
how you, uh, grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get some fruity expressions from
it too, but most of it, the way James grew
[SPEAKER_00]: it was fucking foot, funk, cheesy,
nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are a bunch of people are saying
they still have it or it's still kicking
[SPEAKER_06]: around Hawaii and still this and that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, one of the things that's
cool is like, if you live in an area where
[SPEAKER_06]: there's not so much pressure to change a
lot of old school shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can just kind of stay around because
people can grow it and find a home for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty easy in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get stuck where it's like,
Oh, this, you have to do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that doesn't work anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and now it seems like it's
really bad where prices are so low and
[SPEAKER_06]: things are so rough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like people don't even know where to turn.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the time they start growing
something they think is going to be the
[SPEAKER_06]: next big thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's already played out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a lot of, there's a lot of
hype and there's a lot of flashing.
[SPEAKER_06]: The pan type stuff where for a minute it
gets a good ticket and people are all
[SPEAKER_06]: excited about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then one too many greenhouses or
indoors gets it and then nobody wants it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so after we was just that,
that there's one thing about after we
[SPEAKER_00]: always remembered like any time after we
was in a hybrid that that turf would
[SPEAKER_00]: dominate real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was to me, the way, the way I
always smelled it was like a blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: cantaloupe type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just so addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's always stuck with me over
the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my favorite F GUI cross was done by
Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the F GUI double purple Doja,
which is like an Apollo 13 type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just had these fucking massive
yielding fucking F GUI turps up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me some of the last of those seeds
that I really need to get some more made.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two dog was asking, um, I think sour D
proceeded any of the other stuff in the
[SPEAKER_06]: sense that, um, when sour D was getting
passed around, that's what it was called.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was years before New York city diesel
or East coast, sour diesel, or,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, shroomy cut or, you know,
Amish or, you know, all that different
[SPEAKER_06]: types of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what makes it so confusing is
everybody just got a cut of sour D UK
[SPEAKER_06]: cheese is a Fino of skunk one,
we believe.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to throw in something extra with
the P 91 S one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying I'm going to do it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is, uh, hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is only six seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure that this is the banana
chunk and it has the first name on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause this is the old original packaging
of, uh, I think I call it deep bananas at
[SPEAKER_00]: first, which is the chunky monkey deep
chunk platinum banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, GBX one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just found them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking treasure trova seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just found a bunch in this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about that shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be 10 seeds in this pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love when that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that in the P 91 S one are up right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this is a really rare line that we put
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of pictures of it out there
and it was fucking phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to keep enough back to
remake it, but yeah, I'll put this one out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and maybe someone else would remake
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't take any shrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't know shrooms today.
[SPEAKER_06]: No shroom.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no shrooms today.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm going to do that kind of thing,
I'm definitely not going to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to talk in public, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a while there I got, I got to where I
was taking so many shrooms that I could,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could like keep my cool better than I
could being fucking stoned in a,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a room on shrooms.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a Ruby red grapefruit Fino that
people love out of Soma's NYCD.
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing that people get upset about with
Soma is that he took supposedly some bag
[SPEAKER_06]: seed of sour, brought it to Europe and
crossed it to some kind of Afghani fruity
[SPEAKER_06]: thing that he had over there and then he
called it diesel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sold it as the real deal sour diesel
at a time when it was hard to get.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why people get upset because if
you're, it's nothing like real sour or the
[SPEAKER_06]: diesel family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not even close.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has a lot of, it does.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, people like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not dissing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying it's it, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And who has real sour diesel crosses?
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's, there's different
things about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like it, it sour diesel is
another one of those where people are
[SPEAKER_06]: coming out of the woodwork with real deal
sour.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could probably do a whole show on,
on what we know and don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: They would have set a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: The good part is that most of the diesel
cuts are pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the, most of the Finos that exist
are pretty nice weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you get stuck with one that isn't
the really nice, it isn't the real deal,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then someone was saying something
before about what'd you see first,
[SPEAKER_06]: Urkel or Lavender?
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of saw them at the same time,
right around 03, 04.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, that was right around that same
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was about four or five years
after I had popped Mendo P. There was
[SPEAKER_06]: definitely nothing like Mendo P when it
first came out.
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as something that just naturally
turned purple that deep.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's plenty of Afghans that turned
purple with cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, as, as October came along
and outdoor and stuff, if you left,
[SPEAKER_06]: let them out and let the second run go
late and then got cold at night,
[SPEAKER_06]: they could turn deep purple, but it was
four or five years before that next wave
[SPEAKER_06]: came.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and I don't know when it started.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I was saying before a long
time ago is we don't really know what year
[SPEAKER_06]: Urkel popped.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or where it popped or who did it exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's various people that claim it,
but, um, one thing we know is that it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't called purple Urkel when it first
showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to say the name because
it's not my story to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to give people,
you know, ammo to fucking fake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it was not called purple Urkel
when it first showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like, just, just like I was saying
before, like you don't want to give out,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, you don't want to give out sometimes
real info because people will use it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, like, you know, like I don't
watch this shit, but Matt watches a bunch
[SPEAKER_06]: of like murder mysteries and, you know,
uh, people doing bad stuff to each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of times the cops in stories
will put out one or two things.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lie about the story.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you know that Matt, they do that and
they do that because, so they can weed out
[SPEAKER_06]: all the, all the like hot tips that they
get that use that bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because human nature, you put out a story
and some people will start calling and
[SPEAKER_06]: start, Oh, I saw.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they put out some fake information
just to make sure that they can weed out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if we, if he said what it was,
then there'd be a bunch of stories about,
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my uncle from white thorn grew this
and we called it that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it must be, you know, by my seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I have kryptonite and it throws
a lot of Mendo perps, phenos.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of people that have Mendo
perps in their stuff that don't want to
[SPEAKER_06]: say there's Mendo perps in their stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really obvious when, when it's in
your stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a, there's, there's a lot,
there's a lot of, there's a lot of modern
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff that has Mendo P in it that people
never want to admit that it's in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, but that's pretty common.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jim Ortega on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't fucking know that guy is a sketch
about being in public.
[SPEAKER_06]: He did some prison time.
[SPEAKER_06]: He came from a different era of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think he has any interest in being
public.
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I would personally love to pick
that dude's brain for a while.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so, but yeah, Jim Ortega is,
you know, he gave some really important
[SPEAKER_06]: strains to Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's kind of a total mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kush 4 is going to be one of the ones
that you will see in the NL5 cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: cross heads and maybe, maybe in the
Hawaiian lights too, if we're lucky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I take cuts?
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I used to take cuts of, and most,
a lot of breeders do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: CSI certainly does is you take cuts of
everything you're about to bloom from seed
[SPEAKER_06]: stock.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you find it and you love it,
you still have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why the Mendo perps survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 year old seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they pop?
[SPEAKER_06]: Unlikely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say that the couple seeds of Mendo
perps that I had, although it wasn't
[SPEAKER_06]: called that, I named it that, but the
couple seeds I got were 21 years old at
[SPEAKER_06]: the time that I got them and they popped.
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 year old seeds can pop.
[SPEAKER_06]: 50 year old seeds seems like it's going
way back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that would be like 1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheese Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there will be cheese Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great idea from Fino Delphia.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I'd like to hear anonymous people
on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they say what their role is without
saying exactly who they are given
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying details.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are planning to pop the purest
very, very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to follow through on the
newest Northern lights acquisitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we did not get as many of
those seeds as we did of the NL5 and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian lights, but we are going to try
to do something with them worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything is worth doing with,
if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure that there's some Mendo P
in the cookie.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to go into that whole thing
either right now, because that's a whole
[SPEAKER_06]: story and it would probably cause a bunch
of guff, but I guess it was good for two
[SPEAKER_06]: hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's all good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do believe that there is Mendo P in in
cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: The story is definitely for another time.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of complex.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I mean, there's really what
it boils down to, too, is there's 20,
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 some years ago, there wasn't nearly as
many people breeding as there is now
[SPEAKER_06]: because there wasn't money involved as
much.
[SPEAKER_06]: There wasn't really American seed
companies doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so most people breeding were doing it
just kind of for the love of it or to give
[SPEAKER_06]: good weed to their friends.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so as a result of that, an inordinate
amount of the stuff that people were
[SPEAKER_06]: working on made its way into a lot of the
stuff that's famous now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because there was only such a big
pool to pull from, you know, is kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: the way it happened.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we've been doing this a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to call the auction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call the auction and we're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And next time, I promise you, not so we'll
be more naked and HD HD HD.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm you know, I'm just it's just
chin up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody have a real good night.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, indeed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good seeing you, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good seeing you, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to everyone who showed up and yeah,
all love from all of us.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
