[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had to play this again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna force everyone to watch it
because it's real funny before I start it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was in high school, I tried to act
real straight, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Play football.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to act too gay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the time at the football party
in high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all watched porno and we jerk off in
the same room.
[SPEAKER_02]: True fucking story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought this is kind of gay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just want to fit in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to fit in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to fit in.
I just want to fit in.
So I guess that's pretty straight.
A bunch of dudes all watching porno at the
same time.
Jerking off at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's pretty straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, that shit was funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Had to play it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's F.E.
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Beauty with custom pickups in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds better.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, oh yeah, I need to bring a natto.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get to hear the I just want to fit
in song again?
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was one of the people you forced to
watch it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you've always been fascinated by
male bonding rituals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have.
I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I had more hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Make friends that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make better friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, damn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to get my little skunky guy on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there he goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we going to start off with?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we usually start off with?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we usually start off maybe with
like a general overview of like what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually going to chat about, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so we thought today we would we
would talk about like different parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and flower and like what it means
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll try to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be times where maybe we'll get a
little technical, but we'll try to make it
[SPEAKER_01]: topical and bring it back to stuff that
because there's a lot of different ways of
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different ways of,
you know, there's a lot of methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's anything in weed that leads
people to religion, it's the way that I
[SPEAKER_01]: grow is the best way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have the best pot because of this
method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it gets really hard to debate any
part about it because there's so much
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so much pride, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's it's like art.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, everybody's got ego with their
art.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if someone tells you that you know,
it could be done a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_04]: It hurts.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's there's aspects of
two of like, you know, one size fits all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the sense of depending on what your
goals are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about we'll break it down
into chunks, whether you're breeding or
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you're growing for pure heads or
whether you're trying to grow commercially
[SPEAKER_01]: on a bit larger of a scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's different pros and cons to
your approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not all the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really hard to be like,
oh, I just need to learn this one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this method, if I perfect it,
will consistently do the best for me no
[SPEAKER_01]: matter what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just really not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then maybe we could talk a
little bit about like what those methods
[SPEAKER_01]: do to the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some misnomers maybe about how
everybody thinks that like nutrition is
[SPEAKER_01]: like the only thing really that messes
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's temperature and there's
spectrum and there's how you treat it
[SPEAKER_01]: afterwards and all that that kind of goes
into it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as a result of that, there's like
there's a lot of there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: trying a lot of good, good ways to grow
cannabis that they're not putting all the
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I one of the most common
questions I get in relation to nutrients
[SPEAKER_04]: and feed is when people email me about a
specific strain, they'll ask like,
[SPEAKER_04]: hey, how do I feed it?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's it like?
[SPEAKER_04]: And and I try to explain to them the
difference between like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it depends.
[SPEAKER_04]: It all depends.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what expression,
you know, you're going for.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what expression the plant's
going to get in the first place in your
[SPEAKER_04]: environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really hard to tell people how
you're going to feed because it's not just
[SPEAKER_04]: strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's individual plant and individual
rooms dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it'd be a good way to
illustrate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about it matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like trying to be like, well,
this if you just do this, like you can
[SPEAKER_01]: pick up any woman you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this this this dating method is
just 100 percent effective.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And doesn't take the other human being
into account.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I also thought like this is
this is a little esoteric, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: like there's this really cool book by
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He writes for the New York Times or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his name is Michael Pallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's called The Botany of Desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a great book and documentary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a it's a you know, it's like a
plant's eye view from the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought maybe to like we rarely talk
about like what cannabis or hemp or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what it's trying to do and what it's
going for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in order for us to get what we
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to play with what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To convince it to give us what we're
after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what it wants isn't necessarily
what our end product of smoking it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, in some cases, you know,
like, I mean, basically at its most basic
[SPEAKER_01]: level, the plant wants to mate,
create seed, continue the progeny of
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has zero interest in creating good
smoke for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's not seedless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seedless is failure genetically to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a bunch of stuff that that
plays into that, you know, and we just
[SPEAKER_01]: thought that, you know, like we I,
you know, we we listen to a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hear a lot of discussions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mostly what I see is a bunch of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: No offense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to piss anybody off,
but like patting themselves on the back
[SPEAKER_01]: for what method they've chose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the superior method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people aren't really interested in
hearing different opinions about things
[SPEAKER_01]: too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's very like it's very clickish.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very clickish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you're a salt farmer or you use
bottles.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, right there, like bottle people
are, you know, that's that's kind of faux
[SPEAKER_04]: pas right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Organics are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like not only organics,
but no bottles organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No bottles or no bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: K&F, living soil, you know, full salts,
synganic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's all the I even,
you know, all these different things play
[SPEAKER_01]: into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, and I, you know, I mean,
I think that there's I think that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of misunderstanding that goes into
all of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you hear all these there's all
these talks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to sit here and say that I'm
some, you know, there's other more
[SPEAKER_01]: intelligent people that can talk about
like the pure nutrition aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can give a general overview that will
probably work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But mostly what we're talking about is
like end results and how to manipulate
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants to get what you want.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's different goals and it's not
all the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like, like I've talked about this
a lot in the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: Choosing for selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of when I choose a plant for
selection or for keepers, I'm choosing a
[SPEAKER_04]: plant for keepers for breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, whereas someone someone else's
keeper may not be that because they're
[SPEAKER_04]: looking for an immediate production plant
that has all the traits they want right
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want something that's going to have the
traits that it passes down as opposed to
[SPEAKER_04]: what it's showing up in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Neville and some of the old
timers used to talk about that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that sometimes the breast, the best
breeders were not the plant that they
[SPEAKER_01]: would put into production from that same
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be, there could be,
they could be the same and they could also
[SPEAKER_01]: just end up being different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We end up breeding with production plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because those are what's survived.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, trying to, you know,
it's not like there's a bunch of,
[SPEAKER_01]: even amongst traders and collectors like
ourselves, we're not, you're not trading
[SPEAKER_01]: old males.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but you're not getting like,
oh, that's the 98 male of this and this,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like, no, no, that doesn't,
you're lucky if, you're lucky if like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you'd get a female from that
long ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't think I've ever heard of
anybody keeping old males like that from
[SPEAKER_01]: the Dutch days.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, some people, maybe some of
them do, but they're certainly never going
[SPEAKER_01]: to trade them for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they view them as like the bedrock
of their company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so much G 13 Hayes male.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one, that's one that did make it
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I think about it, I don't know if
it's still around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and now with, with STS and stuff
like that, it's even become more rare
[SPEAKER_01]: because they've eliminated the male in a
lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we could give it, we could start
because it is a little rambly or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we could, we could start maybe with
like, what's your goal?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I was going to break it down
basically into like three, like big
[SPEAKER_01]: chunks, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like growing for you, which is
basically trying to make it as heady as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible and usually relatively small
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's growing for seed and then
there's growing at a larger scale for
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's various obvious, there's
various grades and levels of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a lot of what people are faced
with today in terms of like, how,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do you scale up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Headies.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been a major, major problem for
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are realizing that like,
Oh, like, you know, this, this method that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done for 20 years, it's worked great.
[SPEAKER_01]: My two greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well now I've got six, 10,000 square foot
licenses and my weed's not as nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a lot of people convince
themselves at the beginning of rec that
[SPEAKER_04]: they were totally going to be able to
scale up, you know, like it shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_04]: hard, you know, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just didn't work out that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only, not only from a difficulty
standpoint, but also certain things that
[SPEAKER_01]: might be perfectly economically feasible
at a certain scale, you know, inputs that
[SPEAKER_01]: you might be using or whatever might not
scale up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the amount of liquid you're going to
go through and the amount of this and the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of that and the amount of labor it
might entail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so, and so all those things,
all those things play into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we'll just start real general and
we'll talk about like the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between like growing good weed and growing
for seed.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you're growing,
if you're growing, if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow for good weed these days,
that means seedless.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means you're going to trick the
plant into constantly going, waiting for
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen that never comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you're trying to do is you're
trying to give it, you know, enough
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen, enough badge or boost or
whatever, and to get it to a certain size,
[SPEAKER_01]: get it to flower set, and then grow good
flower, harvest it, smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your gig.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that requires a certain kind of
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where if you're growing from seed,
you're planning on pollinating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then since it's going to be making
babies like seeds inside itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll probably give it a lot more
nitrogen and you'll give it a lot more of
[SPEAKER_01]: a mix that is very different than if you'd
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tend to feed heavy nitrogen during
flower for seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feed it like tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: A very tomato regimen is great for seeds,
keeping them healthy and viable.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I flip out, like, if people feed
sinsemilla like that, because it just,
[SPEAKER_04]: to me, it just ruins it, you know,
when you just flood it with nitrogen for
[SPEAKER_04]: the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and so maybe there's an aspect
that people should realize here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the interesting things is
there's this, I'll give a plug,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's this company called Kanna,
okay, which is a Dutch company that
[SPEAKER_01]: designed nutrition for Kanna.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why they're special is that
for a super long time when people were
[SPEAKER_01]: developing nutrition, they couldn't test
it on cannabis because it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Kanna could.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kanna, you know, they they were able
actually to grow different plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cannabis different ways and then
test how the plant actually uptook
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had this method of like,
give it just enough and nothing more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where like, I would say American companies
are more supersize me, like, we'll sell
[SPEAKER_01]: the customer way more than they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like advanced the 32 product fucking
sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, general hydroponic, you know,
I mean, like the usage rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, go heavy, put a bunch in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what happens with, you know,
from a plant's perspective, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, plants will sit there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they want to do is they have no
idea that there's like humans taking care
[SPEAKER_01]: of them, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they want to soak up as much food as
they possibly can within themselves so
[SPEAKER_01]: that when the food starts to run low,
they have enough left inside themselves to
[SPEAKER_01]: like carry on the process of making seed.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like back in the day, you see a lot of
people that are like, oh, I want to pack
[SPEAKER_01]: on weight on my flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would like give boosters or
something heavy at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just you end up with unused
nutrient in your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what Kanna figured out is that if you
gave it at the at the like early mid part
[SPEAKER_01]: of flower, say like week three on a 10
week strain, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the plant would have the next month
to use up that excess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And grow all that flower and boost itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it would still be running out,
running low towards the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what you want is since you're
going to trick the plant and you're never
[SPEAKER_01]: going to seed it, you don't want a bunch
of that excess stored inside the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what happens sometimes when
people like, quote unquote, pump it or
[SPEAKER_01]: they ride a high EC or they have a lot of
organic nutrition that's like their soil's
[SPEAKER_01]: hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant just soaks up a bunch and it and
it's got a bunch in there because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to make sure when it runs out,
it has enough to make seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't know you're going to make
seedless.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to like plan your nutrition
around what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If a plant knew that it was going to be
seedless, it just it would probably not
[SPEAKER_04]: put so much energy into making the little
hairs, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, you know, like our buddy,
you know, CSI who grows in beds in his
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms that he makes seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he puts enough nutrition in there
for six or seven months.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He mostly feeds water because he's not
concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really high nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something he would ever do if he
was growing for a flower for market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a completely different mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's so bunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when he talks about like when it
fails, people act like, oh, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you just got a bunch of good heady
weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, no, I got a bunch of overly
nitrogened, you know, we are going to burn
[SPEAKER_01]: the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's not going to come out heads
because it was it was a mix for seeds for
[SPEAKER_01]: seed creation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and for to grow heads,
you kind of want to give the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ideally let it use up its excess
before you're done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's also it's also why he doesn't
show a lot of pictures of the actual seed
[SPEAKER_04]: process making, because it's not pretty
like to feed it correctly, to to to have
[SPEAKER_04]: it making healthy seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a visually appealing plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some people and the majority of
people wouldn't understand that part.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't even.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's doing a great job of making thick,
healthy tiger striped seeds that are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be good for customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not going to look pretty where if
he has different rooms, for instance,
[SPEAKER_01]: that he's grown, he's using to do like
seed pops and experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to like phenol hunt and see
what they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those soil beds will be mixed at a
different ratio.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it'll be a lot less nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it'll be a lot more scaled for
flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then, you know, there's and
then there's an there's there's other
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects, too, where it's like plants
really are like people in the sense that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you've got your friends that can
eat whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, and they're and they
stay thin as a rail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got your plants that like look at
a potato chip and gain 10 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants do that same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They eat at different rates.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have different feeding requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have different root systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They drink different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what becomes what becomes hard is
like, you know, I've always thought when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was doing bigger shit that you're trying
to put plants that drink the same and eat
[SPEAKER_01]: the same in the same area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've had situations where I'm
burning one plant or one line and the
[SPEAKER_01]: other line wants more food.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any time I have Urkel in the room,
that's going on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or or, you know, you're trying to grow
something that drinks a lot and really
[SPEAKER_01]: fast versus something that like drinks
slower like Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't need to water that thing as
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you end up over watering it to
compensate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that's what makes like
that's that's honestly like people dis
[SPEAKER_01]: mono cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's why a lot of people like to
mono crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can dial in your nutrient
regimen or how you're feeding your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: or your style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: To fit that crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we have a good buddy, Pip Souvenir
Seed Co or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he talks about, you know, he was at
our party one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, he was he was blown away by how
good that diesel was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, you know, it was it was,
you know, the cut was from him at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he was used to putting one
or two in the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he couldn't feed it the way he'd feed
a whole room of sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would come out nice, but not
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because it's one of those things
where it had different requirements than
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest of the stuff he was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wouldn't come out as nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sour is also one of those where it's like,
fucking you miss it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You miss it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very easy to miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's finicky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, there's an aspect to
that where people think that there's a one
[SPEAKER_01]: size fits all.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a one method they can take.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can take the method they know and
apply it to anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you start to see there's these
like A5 and C5 and the cough and PIF and
[SPEAKER_01]: Cuban black haze are starting to gain in
popularity or even GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to have a plant that takes
12 to 15 weeks, you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: feed it differently than a plant that
takes eight to 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to you're going to have to
you're going to have to veg it for longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to give it a
different mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just so people know, it's not like the
mix dictates what happens to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's trying to feed on what it
wants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's either there or it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a misconception.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, maybe we could talk about that for a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, the plant absorbs salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it absorbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're feeding GH or, you know,
I don't know, you know, Eagle or 22 or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, or any kind of salt or liquid
chem nutrition, you're giving it like the
[SPEAKER_01]: 17 major and macro elements like in like
an IV basically.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you if you're fully organic,
you're still feeding it those same salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just they're in longer chains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to get various bacteria and
and fungi and stuff to break it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like people don't get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, oh, you know, the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you break it, if you took a
perfectly derived organic salt and a salt
[SPEAKER_01]: that GH or cutting edge or somebody throws
in their mix, you couldn't tell the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, even if you are a soil scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that doesn't mean they're the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not that's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like because like, basically,
like, you know, chem is like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: our understanding of what the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic is more like if you get it
perfect, it gives the plant everything
[SPEAKER_01]: that it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a bunch of like
relationships with the with the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: itself that like it likes and we don't
really understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I have a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am not worldly or knowledgeable about
organic feeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always been like a house and garden
can a type dude bottles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just what I rocked with,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you want to force the plant to
drink what you want it when you're doing
[SPEAKER_04]: organics, do you just do something to
lower the pH or raise the pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, when you're doing organics,
you I mean, there's different approaches
[SPEAKER_01]: like there's bottles, like, for instance,
like to use the same thing, canna,
[SPEAKER_01]: bio canna.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you buy organic bottles, you're
essentially buying things where like the
[SPEAKER_01]: company has taken the time to sort of like
cook it or ferment it or brew it or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those salts are more available than
just adding raw amendments to the earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, for instance, we you know,
if you were if you're going to be that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of guy where you're going to get soil
and you want to amend it, a lot of times
[SPEAKER_01]: you would get it and all you want to do is
raw amendments, you'd probably get it at
[SPEAKER_01]: your raw amendments and let it cook for a
month or two before you'd even ever use
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then because what you're
trying to do is you're trying to like get
[SPEAKER_01]: all those all that bacteria and fungi and
everything time to break down the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: food in there and make it available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the big difference is like when you
feed salt, you can guarantee that the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant the availability is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the temperature is right and the pH is
right and the mix is right in your salt,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to get all that food in
organics and hoping that food is there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it has to be a certain pH like a
certain pH is nitrogen can't be carried.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain certain pH chem or organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant has to have that pH to absorb it
through its roots.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And certain ones like nitrogen is more
available at certain pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, there's there's like a chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of why people they give
you that range for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is because, you know, you get five and a
half or five point eight or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be certain things that
are more available than in the mid sixes
[SPEAKER_01]: and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's usually you start out lower and
up higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you want to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's it's it's one of those
things where like if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: well-buffered organic soil, it's probably
something you don't have to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also depends like if you've got a
great soil, but your water is pH nine
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out because it's well water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might need to treat your water to not
make the life of the microbial life in
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's an aspect to it where it's like
you know, and I don't think most people
[SPEAKER_01]: most people look at it as where it's like
salts are sort of like a cheat code,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, where organics is like the pure
way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, there's an aspect to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think that there's some
organics that's dirtier than salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people think that like salt is
made in some kind of crazy lab when really
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like mined minerals that are refined
to a certain purity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're talking hydroponic purity,
that's like one step below like
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really, really clean and it's
designed to run through aerial jets,
[SPEAKER_01]: sprayers, drippers, all kinds of shit,
not clock.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it's low and heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good ones, you know, and that's
another thing, too, is like when people
[SPEAKER_01]: people started, you know, and then you go
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so organic is a label.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think most people get that a
lot of the organic stuff that you get is
[SPEAKER_01]: byproducts from other industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you get I'll give you a
perfect example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get bone meal or blood meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's organic by law.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it comes from major slaughterhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cows aren't organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they weren't fed organic food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be getting McDonald's,
hamburger cows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your bone and blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Burger King, Wendy's.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about like the biggest meat buyers
and producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all mixed together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all it's all the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not actually a way to
differentiate unless you're really lucky
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know an organic farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's all certified organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is one better than the other, though,
like realistically?
[SPEAKER_01]: So bone meal is ground up bones from cows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blood meal is the juice and the sluice
that comes off the slaughterhouse floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they collect it and like powderize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delicious.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feather meal is the same shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a byproduct from the poultry
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's better sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, pulled turkey, chickens,
you know, all the parts that they can't
[SPEAKER_01]: sell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ground up and turned into fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have an aspect where it's like,
oh, I'm fully organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you end up like in the I use bone
meal and blood meal and feather meal and
[SPEAKER_01]: this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, holy fuck, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's it's it's legally organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the legal label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: By law.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't come from organic animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blood meal smells like girls, period.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the issue the issue used to
become to where it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when we used to be gorilla and stuff like
that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first got to California,
you use blood meal or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden you get it wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the the the vultures smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dog slips out and they start circling
or the dogs want to get into it or a bear
[SPEAKER_01]: comes and wants to rip your shit up
because it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd go put a bunch of awesome fish
emulsion in your shit and then you get a
[SPEAKER_01]: black bear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who wants that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who thinks that there's fish and starts
digging for it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then you're and then you're
fucked, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's an aspect where it's like
people think there's a free lunch and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like it takes even if you're using that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes it a while for it to break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it's available quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it not so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like fish emulsion and all that,
that's all from the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the seafood industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's all the it's all the brood bits
of the nasty parts that they can't sell
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the some people like build the
soil or whatever, you know, like some
[SPEAKER_01]: people have stopped using bone meal
because of the issues with cows and mad
[SPEAKER_01]: cow and just all the chem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're selling you fish bone meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, because, you know, it's it's it's
still bones and still calcium and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it comes from the seafood industry
because it's not quite as toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could have an organic style where
you could pick all these inputs where I
[SPEAKER_01]: would rather use canner cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think it would it would be cleaner
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, even even stuff that's clean,
like back one or seabird guano,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they don't they're not there's an
obvious obviously not like factory back
[SPEAKER_01]: one or factory seabird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, you are destroying habitat
to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: For bats, they're going into caves and for
seabirds, they're going to a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: habitat and they're scraping the shit off
it literally to send it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, do you know why that shit
comes from like Indonesia and Peru and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not America.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because America has OSHA and you can't
send a 10 year old boy with a bucket and a
[SPEAKER_01]: shovel into a cave.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have watched and collected one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm dead serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do it where it's super cheap and
there's not a bunch of labor law and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll do it industrial style and they'll
have a bunch of people with buckets and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll have like a bunch of bulldozers
and they'll be fucking up some huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have plenty of bats in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just cheaper to get it out of Peru or
Indonesia and ship it because they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to obey labor laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And kids are great workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and there's not child labor in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a kid with a bucket, you know,
and so it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe me, I've used tons of back guano
and seabird guano and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not dissing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying that that's the reality of
getting it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love plants from I love brewing teas
with it and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's good stuff, but it's not
exactly harvested environmentally soundly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens to the people isn't the
greatest thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember the first time I got sent home
with tea from the hydroponics store.
[SPEAKER_04]: My very first trip got sent home with
compost tea and I really sat there
[SPEAKER_04]: wondering if I was supposed to drink this,
like if it was some hippie brew,
[SPEAKER_04]: like that I was supposed to drink.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't understand it was for the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of my embarrassing stories.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean back, you know,
now we are really in a golden age of teas
[SPEAKER_01]: and compost inputs and availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say that like, I mean, I used to work
in the hydro industry and so I got to know
[SPEAKER_01]: how they sourced a bunch of amendments,
what the differences in quality were and
[SPEAKER_01]: why certain companies were cleaner and
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus other ones that were using cheap
inputs and covering it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you have a situation that goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a bummer, but it's like
there's a lot of stuff that's from the
[SPEAKER_01]: ocean that we used to consider super
heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that they test for heavy metals,
it's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's got too much lead or too much
arsenic or too much cadmium or whatever in
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so you could be like,
oh, I'm using fish emulsion and this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that I've got all this amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I even have a hook and you're putting
all this stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your weed test high for heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's why they tell like women,
you're only supposed to eat so much tuna
[SPEAKER_01]: and so much big fish when you're pregnant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the mercury is a mercury.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that stuff is in, you know,
you want to get some amazing crab or
[SPEAKER_01]: shrimp or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got it in it because they live in a
bath of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in some cases, it's like people are
like, oh, you know, salt are the evil bad
[SPEAKER_01]: choice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And organics is the smooth, reliable
choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that there's you know,
there's like it's more complex than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can grow good weed with both.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a lot of organic weed
that's grown that I don't consider that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some K and F shit be fucking
wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe maybe maybe we should like
get out of the esoteric for a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell a story that like like is
pertinent to people smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I used to go I used to go to the Oregon
Country Fair, OK, which is right outside
[SPEAKER_01]: Eureka.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a famous hippie festival still
goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got delayed a little bit with Covid or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so I went up there and I was I was
from Chicago and I lived out in Cali for a
[SPEAKER_01]: few years and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so I was all salt back then because
where I grew up and where I came up like
[SPEAKER_01]: growing weed, you use salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived in apartments like there wasn't
you weren't like grabbing soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You weren't you didn't have a backyard,
you know, like you was like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, but you move out to Mendo and
it's like a lot more it's a lot more like
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the earth, back to the land or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of people out here that
grow dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went up there and I had all this
salt weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like the super skunk and the
Chem 91 and the Mendo perps and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, sour super dog and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they all loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were all super prejudiced against
chem weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they loved my chem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they all grew organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never knew a bunch of cats that grew
organic like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were like comparing each other's
weed all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so we, you know,
we we ended up, you know, we ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching each other a bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ended up I ended up going and
working a little bit for John Jevons,
[SPEAKER_01]: who's written a couple of famous books.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lives up in Willets by me and learning
as much as I could about organics.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: At a time when like organics was very,
very like do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not very many online didn't exist,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, it was basically you were
buying raw amendments and everything you
[SPEAKER_01]: had to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to do the work yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there was earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was earth juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Earth juice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was very few products.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was very few inoculants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was very few bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was very few.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very like buy raw ingredients and
go for it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did this project for I don't know,
probably four years where I grew my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite strains in my in one of my rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the room was dedicated for
flour for medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had a section that side by side and
the same two lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would grow the best organic weed I
could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would grow the best salt weed I
could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the same strains over and over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was just for head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would pass out a bunch of joints
to friends of mine and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would all be blind testing and they
would just smoke and tell me what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that started to shock me.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes with certain strains,
they consistently preferred the salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the salt was so much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have to put all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people should know back then it's
like we made the people that taught me
[SPEAKER_01]: like we made our own soil in like concrete
in like those concrete tumblers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you'd buy one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, you buy your own
concrete tumbler and you put all your.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put everything in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd stir it up and then you pour it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're wearing a mask.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I had multiple friends go to
the hospital for fungus infections in
[SPEAKER_01]: their lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said breathing guano.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was actually kind of dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of had to like eye and mask and
glove up to be because you're working with
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of shit and a bunch of animal
byproducts and all this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would try to make the headiest
mix I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned that, like some strains
consistently, people like the organic one
[SPEAKER_01]: better and some strains, people,
some consistently like the salt without.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which strains do you remember?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The the the chems and the sours typically
like were easier with salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mendo perps, the super skunk,
a few different ones would come out really
[SPEAKER_01]: nice organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not like you couldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like they weren't good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like what you preferred back
to back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's really important for
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have been asking me a bunch because
I've been making some posts about various
[SPEAKER_01]: historical strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, the only way to have like an
effective comparison is for you to grow it
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself in your environment, in your
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I'm going to get these four sour
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to grow them at the same time
under the same environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to get it from my buddy who
grows a totally different style and his
[SPEAKER_01]: room's different temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to be able to see it in the
same event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these plants, all these plants for
three, four years were all treated the
[SPEAKER_01]: same way every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and and, you know, it was and
and and so, you know, and I have a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of obviously a bunch of friends that smoke
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're giving out AP joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and and trying to get feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think most people ever compare
styles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing one style at a time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you know what's different?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were trying to figure out,
like me and a few friends, we were trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to figure out, well, what is better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is what is and it was surprising in
the sense that, you know, and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: another aspect to where it's like you
start to realize once you start to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more educated about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But indoor organic is almost never like
outdoor organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I wouldn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, well, I mean, I'll give you a perfect
example to make total sense.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So indoor organic is almost 100 percent
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a mixture of peat moss and
perlite and, you know, or or cocoa or
[SPEAKER_01]: different things where outside maybe like
10 percent of the medium is organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rest of it is clay or or or
crushed rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Minerals are like almost 45 percent of
most soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like that's why they talk about like
there's a six inch layer of topsoil in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like your organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then underneath that, it's a bunch of
rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it might be porous rock,
but crushed rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what most earth is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like most people's organic inside is
like soilless with added amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you'd never find like if you took,
say, like sunshine number four or
[SPEAKER_01]: something and rice holes and other shit,
you add all your amendments and you make
[SPEAKER_01]: the super heady mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't exist in nature anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a cannabis specific mix,
basically for an indoor garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you never actually really like any kind
of organic inside is like a series of
[SPEAKER_01]: compromises.
[SPEAKER_01]: To begin with, because you're not like
scraping up a bunch of native earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then using that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not really organic,
is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, you can't call it organic
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic is like a federal term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I don't even think legal weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even think legal weed,
you're allowed to use the term organic
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so, because because organic
is actually you have to you have to meet
[SPEAKER_01]: federal criteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to to get the organic label and
not be lying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't get federal approval for
cannabis because they still think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people are saying artificial
light isn't organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and then there's a thing,
too, where people talk about this is like
[SPEAKER_01]: a big keyword.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by no means am I trying to diss
anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what is living soil mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I always assumed it meant there
were fucking worms and microbial life,
[SPEAKER_04]: a bunch of that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But almost all organic, if it's active,
has a bunch of microbial life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you if you take home a well
made tea from your hydro store that they
[SPEAKER_01]: brewed fresh or you make tea yourself,
you're putting in trillions of living
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms into your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it typically means when people
talk about living soil, they're basically
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about usually like some kind of no
till method or some shit like that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, but even that is like,
do you know why most people use no till?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no clue to prevent erosion,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of because if you don't till
the earth, then when the rain comes,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not going to wash away into the river
bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so imagine, imagine like you're on a
factory farm in fucking, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere like Iowa and you're tilling the
earth like a foot deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're fluffing it up and you're making it
all light and loose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's torrential rain that
comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that runoff, a bunch of earth
washes away into the Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how that's where most of our
topsoil went.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they talk about the dust bowl in in
in Oklahoma, they tilled up all the earth
[SPEAKER_01]: and the wind came up and it blew all the
fucking earth away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was like there was because of the
buffalo and shit, there was like 10 feet
[SPEAKER_01]: of topsoil in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't know what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What with farming and they got a drought
and they tilled it all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all these huge winds came in and
they and it washed it all fucking away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the dust bowl meant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the dust bowl was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was literally it was literally people
tilling farmland and then the farmland
[SPEAKER_01]: blowing away in the fucking storms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no till is basically like this thing
where in conventional agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't want to till the earth and have
it blow away or rinse away in rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't they don't till the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They leave it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just dig a hole for for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of them use conventional
herbicides and kill all the weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no till inside is like this guy just
commented.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought no till was like not disturbing
the microbial content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what weed people say for no
for no till outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that but it's also a huge amount of
erosion control.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't have erosion problems
indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could till all you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you're going to get a
windstorm that's going to blow away your
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I was confused when you're
talking about a windstorm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering how that applies to indoor
for no till.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like no till was designed so the soil
doesn't fly away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it gets applied to an indoor
environment where there's no wind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, there's people and
when I'm talking about nutrition,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure I'm going to people are going to
get all upset because I'm going to you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to start stepping on toes and
they're going to say, oh, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, it's about the layers of microbial and
fungal and this and that not disturbing
[SPEAKER_01]: them or whatever, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be honest, like cannabis is a
shallow root growth plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It likes to grow wider than it goes deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically what you're trying to do
with cannabis is give it a not some kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of aerated good amount of air and water
and the ability for the roots to freely go
[SPEAKER_01]: where they want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so a hard, compact soil,
that's not that's not a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also been I've also been accused of
being wider than deep.
[SPEAKER_04]: This this is wider than deep.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shallow, even shallow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some say shallow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some would say shallow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does all in perspective?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some would say so getting back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, getting back to like what
all this means is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was reading some comments from some
people the other day where they were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about like their friends that do
no till.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works amazing for certain strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then other strains they do don't
respond very well to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, you have a situation like we
have a buddy up in Trinity and it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're going to do depths organically,
that's a lot harder than a single season
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can give it, you know,
food designed for vegetative growth for a
[SPEAKER_01]: series of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then food designed for bloom for a
series of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as easy organically to like get
two or three roots out of the same thing a
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and time it perfectly for what
you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like and I don't don't get me
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think organic quality weed is like can
be better than any salt, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think a lot of people don't get
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like salt has a way higher floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of poorly grown organic
weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it's not like they're
messing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's more just like the availability
of the food isn't there when the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: needs it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it took me years,
years and years and years to finally smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: organic weed that was really grown well
organic and to me was as well grown as
[SPEAKER_04]: anything grown badass and salts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was from Mad Elite.
[SPEAKER_04]: That dude kills it organic and changed a
lot of my own ego with like thinking,
[SPEAKER_04]: fuck, salts are so much better,
so much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why waste the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was it was really special.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it also depends, you know,
like so, you know, you got to fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is kind of like what I said in
the beginning, where it's it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you got to fit your growing
style for what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's important because they don't
all fit, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if let's face it,
like in today's economy with weed prices
[SPEAKER_01]: so cheap and, you know, no matter whether
you're whether you're in the traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: market or you're in the fully legal
market, you know, times are tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people are trying to get X amount
of weight per greenhouse or per outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: patch or per grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're trying to get as much pretty
weed because people are visual as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not necessarily heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even back in the old traditional
days, a lot of the guys I knew that were
[SPEAKER_01]: running 50 or 100 lighters would get their
heads from people that were growing six or
[SPEAKER_01]: eight lighters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty common thing even now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the other part of it, too,
is like back in the 215 days when anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: with a 215 card could go to like a
dispensary and excuse me, legally sell
[SPEAKER_01]: their herb to that dispenser.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about that dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no cost of entry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bought so much garage weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they could just pick based on quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guys are bringing in weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, you know, it was cut two
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still in the perfect condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in big form.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in turkey bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like not very regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can just pick the best and ditch
the rest.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, with all this legality, you know,
a lot of times some of that weed doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: hit the shelf for two or three months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's being grown in these big salt
factories or it's being grown at a scale
[SPEAKER_01]: where like all the little things that the
eight lighter guy could do, they can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've actually experienced scaling up
major, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you talk about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never done the except with the big,
big reversal and having to save those
[SPEAKER_04]: dummies fucking already flowering crop for
a reversal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had never done major, major scale as far
as feeding and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was it was significantly different,
especially re-vegging at that scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any, you know, and there's there's an
aspect to where you can talk about this is
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty funny because, you know,
there was these people that just opened up
[SPEAKER_01]: like whatever it is, like 126 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fucking SoCal, they're calling it
craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody agrees that there's a difference
between craft and commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference is, is that people get
heighty about like, when does that where
[SPEAKER_01]: is that line?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and like I said before,
I used to never see the people that would
[SPEAKER_01]: do a great growers and doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still would not get the same quality
weed of their 50 or 100 lighter that we
[SPEAKER_01]: would get out of a garage size scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part, they just wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had way less time per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't doing quite as many little
things that made the plants happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like it was a little bit more
commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and then there's an aspect,
too, where it's like they so scaling
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times when people scale,
they lose quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can talk about that for a minute,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not trying to diss them,
but you look at like the the jungle boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or some of these big, you know,
rock wall factory farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're doing that because they have
all these different rooms and relying on a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of hippies and weirdos to like hand
water everything right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day is problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, they're trying to automate
all this different shit and then just like
[SPEAKER_01]: work on looking at the data and then
messing with the settings and the data and
[SPEAKER_01]: not looking each individual plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what they're doing is, is that
there's a lot of technology from northern
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe that basically is the basis of all
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grote and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all learned how to do all this
growing tomatoes and peppers and cucumbers
[SPEAKER_01]: and all these vegetables for places that
are shitty like northern Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: but have money.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can go there and you can see
hothouses, greenhouses that have tens of
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of plants, tens of thousands of
lights.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see these tricks systems that
they're installing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all based on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they get all these things and they're
looking at graphs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've got they've got like the
moisture meter and they're perfectly
[SPEAKER_01]: planning the wet and dry cycles and
they're and they're, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: dialing in their their salts and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like even the setup itself is
like a plumbing nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people call their weed cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what happens is, is that you're
trying to do a one size fits all and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis actually it turns out it doesn't
like being fed perfectly its whole life.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they've done studies where they've
shown that certain amounts of drought
[SPEAKER_01]: stress or certain amounts of stress to the
plant actually creates more terpenes and
[SPEAKER_01]: more crystal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say beat the hell out of your
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I've seen it firsthand though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stress like where did I first learn that
about it?
[SPEAKER_04]: It had to do with bugs attacking the
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why the trichomes are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like bugs signal, you know, they signal a
thing to the plant where I need to make
[SPEAKER_01]: more THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to make it harder for them to crawl
on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to make it harder for them to bite
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you get these perfect rooms and
everything's perfect and everything's
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's dialed in and they're like
fine tuning stuff and they have control
[SPEAKER_01]: over all their parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then their weed comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and the guy that like,
you know, like they got a little dry and a
[SPEAKER_01]: little wilty a few times and they stressed
here and there a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that weed was happier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're trying to grow like a
reasonably good looking product at scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can't have fucking, you know,
three dozen rooms and treat it like you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a garage or treat it like you have
one greenhouse and no job.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, you have a situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people that are on IG that are
quite popular and they don't have that
[SPEAKER_01]: many plants and they have a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's their job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can go out there and you can baby
them and you can give them every little
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you join a legal scene and like
you're working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't talk very much about what I was
doing, but like you try to develop some
[SPEAKER_01]: things at scale and you've got to water
some acreage and it's a whole different
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not that easy to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I can't imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's so much to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people messed up even just going
from how big they were doing just to like
[SPEAKER_01]: two or three or four, 10,000 square foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like and they started really and they
started, you know, really messing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they start really messing up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and and so like a lot of and
that's why because because like
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries can't just buy the best weed
from whoever walks in with a duffel bag
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were able to buy from like a lot of
small time local gardeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and the Bay would get tons of
people from even LA and LA and San Diego
[SPEAKER_01]: were flooded with weed from Humboldt and
Lake Mendo.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was people that would drive up to my
area every week to get to bring it down to
[SPEAKER_01]: the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was their entire gig was to flow it
right into dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they could they could say yes or no
to any weed that walked through their
[SPEAKER_01]: door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's all this regulation and
there's all this thing and all this
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging and there's all this testing and
there's all this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are trying to learn how to grow
on a lot bigger scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their weed is like way down,
way down in quality, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and people are going to learn
they're going to get better over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now customers are fucked because
they're paying more than they used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the availability is shittier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least it looks good on IG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that and that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: IG fucked it all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you couldn't sniff it or smell it
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you, you know, you could just see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Cookies, Cookies was perfectly
timed for the social media wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was unusually visually
attractive and very unique looking.
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely did stand out from what was
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's a whole thing where you
see so many of these different strains and
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of them, I think, have been chosen
based on looks and testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can be like, not to judge it,
but oh, look, here's apple fritter and it
[SPEAKER_01]: tested 33%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look how fire it looks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it fucking is the worst herm balm
on the face of the earth for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you smoking?
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone's all excited because the
people that they respect are hyping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then six months later, you know,
you're like, I don't think I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy that $70 eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't, it just didn't hit it for
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, before, before we scoot too
far along, I do remember there's one thing
[SPEAKER_04]: that I wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when it's feeding for breeding,
as far as vegetative stuff, one thing that
[SPEAKER_04]: I find a lot of breeders do when I talk to
them and it's totally counterproductive is
[SPEAKER_04]: when you are running cycles of different
rooms and different, different strains,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're trying to do multiple projects and
they're one after the other, after the
[SPEAKER_04]: other, you start learning to feed
differently, to slow down the growth,
[SPEAKER_04]: to try to make room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not something that's,
that's totally counterproductive and
[SPEAKER_04]: counterintuitive, but some of us have
learned how to stunt our plants and bring
[SPEAKER_04]: them out of being stunted because it's
just, there's no way to, to constantly
[SPEAKER_04]: have that room to feed in new cycles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, there's things you'll do
when breeding that you would never do for
[SPEAKER_04]: production because it would absolutely
just, but fuck you for, for great flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you've got, if you've got a big
collection of moms and stock, then very
[SPEAKER_01]: likely what you're doing is you're keeping
a bunch at moderate to small size under
[SPEAKER_01]: enough light to like, keep them going and
happy, but nothing too vigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got, and then you're
planning, you're planning on putting some
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in like a vigorous, very well lit
spot to get them going because you have
[SPEAKER_01]: projects in mind for them and you want to
get very vigorous cuttings and small
[SPEAKER_01]: plants going off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a rotation there that goes
in where it's like a fine balance of
[SPEAKER_01]: hurting to, to not, you know, if you're
someone like, you know, like, like CSI or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, and you've got 150 different
plants in moms, and then you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of stuff you're keeping for phenol
hunting and you, and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got hundreds of different strains
and, and you might want to slow things
[SPEAKER_01]: down on a bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, a phenol hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to keep it going really
slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and even starve it somewhat
until you see what you have, because if
[SPEAKER_01]: you start pumping it, like you're trying
to pump it to get ready to bloom a room,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of a sudden you've got jungle growth
and where do you put it all?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially keeping some of the older
lines, the, the, you know, fly hazes and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get, it gets jungly so fucking fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, and, and so you,
you have an aspect where it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought we could talk about it from
a flower perspective too, because you try
[SPEAKER_01]: to talk to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like the thing that I get the most
when we, you try to talk nutrition is like
[SPEAKER_01]: smugness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people, people are smug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they want, they want to know that I'm
growing the better way.
[SPEAKER_01]: This way works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what the fuck are you talking
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I get two and a half pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody thinks my weed is fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I'm not, I'm not dissing
anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not like, that's not what I'm trying
to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to say that like very few
people are doing side by sides to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: see what methods are giving them better
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're growing the same style at one
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they change styles, they change it
over entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so you're not really
comparing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just, and you know, most people's
goals are just to sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's things with organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I first moved here, there was
people that had been using their beds or
[SPEAKER_01]: using their holes in the, in the Hills or
whatever for 10 or 15, 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every year those things got better and
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they were able to add amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were able to add, you know,
bacteria and various things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, old and aged and fully
functional and work and going to good to
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to grow organic,
the first ripper two probably isn't going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be as nice as the fifth or sixth one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense because it takes like,
you know, you've heard about green sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever heard about green sand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Green sand doesn't even become
bioavailable for two years after you put
[SPEAKER_01]: it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with normal silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like one year, I think
there's things that are on that are fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: immediate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's things that take two or three
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's things that take a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you have aged, if you have aged
stuff, you know, like a lot of that
[SPEAKER_01]: breaking down and availability has
happened and the natural cycle is doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're starting a fresh facility,
you're going to get a bunch of raw
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients or whatever, like,
you know, tossed together and you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have to amend.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're like, if you,
probably another thing is that like,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're a small tent farmer or you're a
small garage farmer and you're just trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow the best you can, don't try to
copy some giant scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not the way for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not growing as good a weed as you
could on a smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, you're like a hobbyist slash
farmer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to grow at scale,
you're going to try to have to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: how can I take the methods that I like and
scale them up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably going to sacrifice some quality
at scale, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, and if you're, if you're
trying to grow for seed, then you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: then definitely you're not growing for
flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably going to want to add more
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably going to want to top dress
with some different things, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: I also like to use a, and I'm a sucker for
PowerSI just because I used, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: regular silica for so long and didn't
understand that it wasn't really very
[SPEAKER_04]: bioavailable for the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I started using the PowerSI
stuff, because someone was asking about
[SPEAKER_04]: feeding for veg moms and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably one of the biggest game
changers for me was that specific additive
[SPEAKER_04]: monosilicic acid or orthosilicic acid,
because it makes, it makes everything so
[SPEAKER_04]: readily and bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just so fast how quick it uptakes
nitrogen and everything that goes along
[SPEAKER_04]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should also say something too,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so whether you're organic or salt,
one of the big reasons why things don't
[SPEAKER_01]: grow in winter is that the roots get too
cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the pores shrink.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the pores shrink and the,
and the, and the relationship between the
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure, both in the roots and within the
soil itself changes, they can't uptake
[SPEAKER_01]: salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're feeding with 50 degree water
and you've got, and you're growing with
[SPEAKER_01]: like Kana or, you know, or Athena or any
of these things people are mentioning,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's too cold, your plants are all
going to suffer because the plant's not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to suck up the nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your pH can be perfect, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But the temperature's too much for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs a certain temperature range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also a thing too, where it's
like, water in the eighties holds like
[SPEAKER_01]: half the oxygen that water in the sixties
holds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's actually like a window there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where like mid sixties, the low seventies
is probably the best ratio of like
[SPEAKER_01]: absorbability versus like oxygen ratio,
because the only place your plant really
[SPEAKER_01]: absorbs oxygen is through its roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes CO2 into the leaves and it takes
O2 into the roots, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when people overwater, that's what
fucks the plant up is there's no oxygen in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots can't breathe, so they drown,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, there's an aspect where
it's like, if you're growing indoor and
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to be organic, there's
trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you see these people that are like,
oh, I'm on the 26 cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just add various amendments
over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just water it, the organic does what it
needs to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant absorbs what it wants,
when it wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I have people that grow organic,
they're growing pots and their whole goal
[SPEAKER_01]: is to give it enough food to veg and bloom
to where they want and then run out of
[SPEAKER_01]: food towards the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that the plant starts to starve itself
for nutrition and you start getting all
[SPEAKER_01]: those beautiful autumn colors on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you harvest it, it's used up
all of its excess, because if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing K&F style or you're growing like
stuff that's amended that you just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're no till and you're never
changing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you're never flushing,
for instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some people are a big believer in
flush, you know, whether you're even salt
[SPEAKER_01]: or organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people want to give it just the
amount of food it needs and then starve
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people give it chock full food
right up until the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times when you're growing for
production, you know, like people,
[SPEAKER_01]: the other thing is like when you're
growing for flower and this always used to
[SPEAKER_01]: make me laugh, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that people want the best weed,
but one yellow leaf and you fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're looking at a bag and
they're like, oh, there's a little bit of,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a tiny bit of brown in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a tiny little bit of yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should give me a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some fucked up weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, no, I flushed it for two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, no, no, it's got some
funk in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people will just pump it right
up until the day of harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it looks better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it looks better to the broker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to smoke as good,
but it looks better to the broker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what they care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want the broker to bitch and
start kicking the tires and try to knock
[SPEAKER_01]: points off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then people don't grow as nice a
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's even a thing where like,
you know, uh, I'll say this about the
[SPEAKER_01]: chems where it's like, if you grow the dog
or what people call the chem 91 now and
[SPEAKER_01]: you take it, what we all used to take it,
which is about 70 ish days, it usually
[SPEAKER_01]: tests between 18 and 22%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it knocks your head off.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you take it 53 or 54 days,
it'll still have white hairs all over it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it'll test 28 to 32%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of people that like put it on
the market, they take it early.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get that high percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the, the shop and the,
and the distro or whatever, like it's one,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't want to give you for a 19 or
21% weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to give you the price
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so fucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's 31%, so you'll, you'll see
weed and you're like, I'll look at this
[SPEAKER_01]: weed and I'll be like, that dog is like
two weeks premium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it tests that 30% and the shop is
happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The distro is happy and they'll give you
your price.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not as good for the smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a lot of cases, like these
regulations and these new rules are not
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the smoker into account.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in some sense though, like I think
smokers, may have priced themselves out
[SPEAKER_04]: just by, just by absorbing things like
cookies, things, things that are,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, cardboardy with high THC stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were happy with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Despite most people, like when you really
ask them, like, do you really like,
[SPEAKER_04]: like that, you know, the form cut,
do you, do you really like getting high
[SPEAKER_04]: off that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they'll be like, Oh, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, for 20 minutes or 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, they kind of let themselves be
told what to buy, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: They do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where we ended up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, so there's an aspect, one of the
things that's interesting and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: something I mentioned before, but it bears
repeating, I guess, is like the first four
[SPEAKER_01]: or five years that they published,
like the Emerald cup and like some high
[SPEAKER_01]: times entries for THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were able to see, like,
you know, before people were breeding by
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers, before a lot of breeders were
getting data on like, what, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the, what the THC content was,
almost everything that was winning was
[SPEAKER_01]: between 22 and 26%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was like four or five things in the
first five years, like that ever tested in
[SPEAKER_01]: the upper twenties or hit 30.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can like, and two of them were chem 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was another weird one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember how rare the 30% club used to
be?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was unheard of until like 2009,
10 people started claiming the thirties,
[SPEAKER_04]: 30%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now you have this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically all the favorite lead that
people were paying good digits for was
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in and the low to mid twenties at
best.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it basically means as soon as you hit
high teens to mid twenties, that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: almost all the elites were falling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that everybody fucking drools
over from back then, cushions,
[SPEAKER_01]: sours, fucking all this shit was all
hitting that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people started growing because
shops were like, I'll pay you more for
[SPEAKER_01]: higher THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they start selecting cuts that test
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily ones that smoke better and
start selecting labs that test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that's why I say breeding by
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're, instead of breeding by smoke
testing and what your friends think and
[SPEAKER_01]: how long lasting the high is, like you
were mentioning or how intense it might
[SPEAKER_01]: be, they start being like, Oh,
well this one tests at 32 and 4% terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no such thing as a fucking high
30 yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you see there's now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, there's, there's a lot of
things that people do like, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, CSI have talked about this a
bunch where there's a lot of labs that
[SPEAKER_01]: over test.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's good for the distro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes an easy sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody likes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's done experiments where he sent
things off to commercial labs and sent the
[SPEAKER_01]: same bud to a friend who he knows is going
to do an accurate test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might be as much as five or 8%
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it much different, vastly
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is, is now you've got five
or six or seven or eight years,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years or whatever, breeding by numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a huge 30 plus percent club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Master flex posted something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 40%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you start getting higher and higher,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but then the effect sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it matter?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I, I had a blueberry purple punch
test at 34.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, anything's possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't even pull those numbers out of
individually, you know, and what's crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: about that is when you think about 30 or
35 or 40, like Matt was just laughing
[SPEAKER_01]: about, that's the percentage of THC by
weight on the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's crazy because you start getting to
these numbers and it's like, is it just
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be like, you know, how much THC
can you pack on a plant?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how much is left for cannabinoids and
other cannabinoids and yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not obviously like alcohol where
Everclear is stronger than vodka,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is stronger than wine, which is
stronger than beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there is, there is a certain
situation where like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: CSI and I see Fletch on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some old school strains that only
test like eight, 10, 12%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't hit that hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you get up to 18 to 20 to 22 to
24, that's kind of like all the elites and
[SPEAKER_01]: the old best weed faults.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know where most of the skunky stuff is
falling right now that we've been looking
[SPEAKER_04]: at?
[SPEAKER_04]: Low teens.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Four to eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four to eight for the most skunky stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, the Mendo perps is
supposedly, you know, seed from the late
[SPEAKER_01]: seventies or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tests, you know, eight or 10% at
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the S1s can get up into the high
teens, but the mom cut itself is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: low, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that used to be super common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think even like old school skunk
one, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 13 to 15 back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they could get testing done,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've gone from like the start of
everything where things were, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: low to, you know, single high single
digits to low teens, to mid teens,
[SPEAKER_01]: to upper teens, low twenties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's all, well, maybe it's all
fake or whatever, but it doesn't seem like
[SPEAKER_01]: after a certain point, there's a big
correlation between high numbers and best
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because my friend would get all pissed off
because they'd be like, dude, I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: if, I don't know if I can get your weed
for the right price.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dog is only, this Chem 91 is only
testing at 18%.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it took your head off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but they would rather take two
week preemie Chem 91 because it tested at
29.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just, I just think that like
people started rather, the only thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: matters is like how, how it affects you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more people get away with effects
and like not testing stuff, like by
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking it with a variety of humans.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because even one person, two people,
like some of my favorite weed is stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that Matt doesn't like at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just not that he doesn't appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't make him feel good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of it just fucked me up, like
paranoid or anxiety or yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people get, some people get weirded
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people love a buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a range of effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think if you get away from like,
I don't think a bunch of people are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke testing anymore.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to find something that
looks impressive and tests impressive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden now we have a
bunch of like midsy elites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a bunch of elites where it's like,
people were saying, Oh, I hate fritter,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like, well, there was a minute
there where like, and people are growing
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff because they're like, Oh,
this weed gets this amount of pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an elite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to grow lemon cherry gelato
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to grow this runs by this,
or I'm going to grow this jealousy cut
[SPEAKER_01]: because my buddies can get top dollar for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not, I'm not trying to call it
mids, but it's probably not going to stand
[SPEAKER_01]: the test of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, like right now sours
coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around diesels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's fire weed and it works and it
smokes and it tastes great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that weed, weed that works
is always going to have a popularity basis
[SPEAKER_01]: where weed that doesn't work, you know,
like you can only, the hype boys can only
[SPEAKER_01]: hype it for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, burner can obviously sell the shit
out of anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he's, he's great at promotion.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's great at getting hip hop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And rap and various stars smoking his weed
and exclusive spots and building up a
[SPEAKER_01]: horrible, horrible kisser.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't let him lie to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a liar about that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's an aspect where it's like,
you can only promote something for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can only force people to like
something for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before they make their own decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why, that's why you have all
this shit that like, it's like flashing
[SPEAKER_01]: the pan that gets popular for eight or 10
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a year, a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's replaced by some new hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where things that used to get popular
before, like the purples or the cushions
[SPEAKER_01]: or the sours or whatever, the Skittles,
when they become organically popular,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it's like grassroots popularity
drives it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot more lasting than when
it's hyped.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, hype has become marketing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weed wasn't, weed wasn't ready for modern
marketing, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't ready for it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were so ripe to be abused by modern
advertising techniques.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That like, you know, it just got
overwhelmed and people realized,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I don't even need to have good weed to
make money.
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 years ago, that shit wouldn't have
worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody would have laughed at a
motherfucker for trying to front that
[SPEAKER_04]: hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, nowadays it just flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years ago, the only way something
became elite was when enough people that
[SPEAKER_01]: were respected decided it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, or, you know, the market demand
or the market demanded it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the market really, when it boils down
to it, when you have stuff like the purple
[SPEAKER_01]: wave with the Urkel and the Mendo P and
the grape ape and all those and granddaddy
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that, or you have the Kush wave in
Southern California or the sour thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: happened for 10 years, that was market
dictated.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of, a bunch of people wanted to
get as much of it as they could.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they knew that the customers would
endlessly buy it and they didn't get
[SPEAKER_01]: burned out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you can have 40 different
fucking named Kush's in SoCal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to name them all the other
day and it like, made me want to pound my
[SPEAKER_01]: head against the, because there's
literally like, you could walk into,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 2010, you could walk into a
dispensary in LA and they would literally
[SPEAKER_01]: have like two dozen kinds of Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them had like 50, 60 different
types of OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these different names on some of them
were repeated and just somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just had different names.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, like the entire dispensary was
one family of wheat and slight variations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and you know, from the East
coast and different things come into
[SPEAKER_01]: California, sour was like endless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was endless demand for gas,
you know, and now instead of seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: endless demand for one or two things that
people can focus on, a lot of growers are
[SPEAKER_01]: like, what the fuck do I even grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're in the legal market,
you don't have a direct connection with
[SPEAKER_01]: your consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to get a distro and unless you
own them, you have to get a distro and
[SPEAKER_01]: then a dispensary to buy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember Redd up in Canada talking about
that with the Canadian legal stuff about
[SPEAKER_04]: now they have the buyers or people that
aren't even from cannabis now and they are
[SPEAKER_04]: who determine what value you're getting
for your weed, non-smoking corporate
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, that was a depressing part of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked that interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was super personable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was hard to listen to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the, just the reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of what matters and what doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And him looking at, at testing and
paperwork and deciding what to do without
[SPEAKER_01]: even seeing the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if it didn't have the testing and
the paperwork, right, it was irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of times, okay, there's a lot
of stuff out there that's really fire
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why you can't get it is
because it doesn't make financial sense
[SPEAKER_01]: for the grower to grow it because the
people that are in between him and you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You personally out there, you get fucked
because the growers friends get to have
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, you know, it gets traded
amongst each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets survived and all that,
you know, but the consumer doesn't get to
[SPEAKER_01]: see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and we were joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll mention it one more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's, there's this, you know,
huge grow that's getting set up in SoCal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like over a hundred acres and
everybody was ragging on them or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's like another big corporate
takeover type thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you look at their clone list and
they're getting a bunch of gelato hybrids
[SPEAKER_01]: and Skittles hybrids, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the market is underserved right now
with gelato and Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really got to fill that niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course not, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and you know, if, if customers
could buy straight from the farm or
[SPEAKER_01]: straight from cooperatives or whatever,
you know, then cooperatives would be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow more niche weed, you know,
and be like, Oh, I'll do some,
[SPEAKER_01]: try to get some real Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to find some real sour diesel,
try to find some Urkel, try to find,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they should be with legality,
all the classics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be able to buy Led Zeppelin in
the, in the, in the record store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They got straight from Led Zeppelin?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just mean, imagine like, you're like,
Oh no, it's not popular anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You weren't around the seventies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like legal weed, there should be a thing
where it's like all the hits if we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to compare it to music, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go get all kinds of punk that's
like way out of date, but you can't get
[SPEAKER_01]: Acapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get, you know, G13, NL2.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get, you can't get the classics
of weed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so right now California itself is a
wash and all this candy name bullshit,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people want to buy that stuff,
it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, I'm not trying to throw it out
there, but you can't, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, it's, it, it can't all be
Sherba Lotto.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't I get real sour diesel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't I get real Kush?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't I get Trinity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't I get Bubba Kush?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't I get granddaddy purple?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because, because there's,
there's like, you know, consumers don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have power to demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to go to the store and they have
to buy what the store wants to put in
[SPEAKER_01]: their store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that, that might be getting
chosen based on their margin.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this company up by me,
fucking Flo Khanna, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they blew through a shit ton of
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know, I don't know if people know
this, but like, there's a lot of big
[SPEAKER_01]: companies that pay dispensaries for shelf
space.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Straight self space, shelf space,
like, you know, and that, and that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: profit they make just to put the fucking,
the weed on the shelf so the consumer can
[SPEAKER_01]: see it, you know, in the 50s, or in the
60s or whatever, there was that huge
[SPEAKER_01]: record scandal because everybody,
all the DJs, disc jockeys, it was pay to
[SPEAKER_01]: play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The payola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how, how does, how does your,
how does your hit get be popular?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't get a radio station to play
it so people hear it and they want to go
[SPEAKER_01]: buy your album.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's people that were getting
bribed to play certain things and not play
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm connecting it to music again,
but it's the same fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: These dispensaries, because there's not
enough of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're deciding what gets on their shelf
and not, and they're deciding it what's
[SPEAKER_01]: based on what's good for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not what's good for the consumer out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's good for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so choice has actually gone down
quite a bit, quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Expenses up, quality is down, choices
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you, how do you, like,
let's say that, that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: CSI or somebody like, or me or whoever,
Fletch comes up with an amazing new
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you're vertically integrated and
you can control the supply chain,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't even guarantee you're going to
get it in a shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't guarantee at all that a
budtender will give a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so it's like a whole deluge of
like everything that's already,
[SPEAKER_01]: already popular and variations on that
theme.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it gets controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the reason why I think that all
these elites from, I always talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: like the nineties and the early two
thousands are still my favorite era of
[SPEAKER_01]: weed is it's because the best weed from
then was consumer choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I just read that question popped up
after everything we said.
Anyway.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, but yeah, that,
you know, it, it, all the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sour became popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush became popular because people wanted
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were willing to spend a bunch of
money on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was demand and, you know,
and, and, and people wanted to fill that
[SPEAKER_01]: demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's like, oh, it's, you know,
it's here's a bunch of, here's a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with nurseries, people might not know
this, but most, most like cultivators,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't even get to keep their own mom
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to get it from a nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the nursery might offer 10 or 15
different things for this season.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might have a hundred things,
but they're only, they only mom'd up
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to do like a lot of certain stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you're, you're forced to operate
off their menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like the nursery limits you,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I was working in a big scene a
couple of years ago, I was trying to find
[SPEAKER_01]: some, some, some real sour diesel,
like on the legal market metric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't find it pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best thing I could find was spy rock
sour, which was some sour across the,
[SPEAKER_01]: some Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't find it pure to grow on the
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was consulting at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but back in the day in two 15,
you could be like, Oh, we're going to fill
[SPEAKER_01]: these four greenhouses with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to take duffel bags
into dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to buy it and people
are going to be stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: 64 ruined the fucking world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of, most of, most of, uh,
most of the good cushion, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: good Kush that was in LA came from my neck
of the woods.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was constantly brokers coming up
that their entire job was just to grab
[SPEAKER_01]: excess capacity from up here and bring it
down to the, the SoCal, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and, and so people could go hunt
the best weed and then go, and then the,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the, you know, the, the,
uh, dispensaries could pick the best week
[SPEAKER_01]: if they wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's like, they have to buy it from a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to buy it from a distro and the
distro has to buy it from a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just turned everything into like a
commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as a result of that, everybody,
I never thought I was worried about a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of shit with legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought that like we would accept
way higher prices than the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the gray market and shittier quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so far that's what we've gotten.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's what we've gotten.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we started off talking
about, and the reason why we've gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: that is because you have all these
commercial farms that have intense
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure with taxes and overhead and
regulations and paying out all this
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And quality and consumer happiness is
like, they do the best they can in some
[SPEAKER_01]: instances, but it's not that great,
but they're doing the best they can with
[SPEAKER_01]: the constraints they're put under.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of little things that used to
get done to make weed nice is getting
[SPEAKER_01]: eliminated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so your weed isn't as nice,
you know, and people talk about all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your weed is fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your weed's not fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and a lot of times it's like
some of these things like the Emerald cup
[SPEAKER_01]: and all this different shit, you know,
like, and I'm not saying this,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known Tim for a long time,
so this isn't a diss at him on any level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're forced to basically like,
for the most part, only accept from like
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed buyers, people aren't entering
the best weed in California anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have to cut off this large
segment of the population that used to win
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking cups.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They used to be able to come there with
their perfectly grown greenhouse weed from
[SPEAKER_01]: their little greenhouse that they treated
perfect and they got to give two to four
[SPEAKER_01]: hours ounces to the testing and then they
placed third.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but you know, but but the thing is the
difference, Fletcher's like stop shitting
[SPEAKER_01]: on my weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference between Fletcher from what
I like from Archive, from what I
[SPEAKER_01]: understand is that they have a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they have control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Archive can make a choice to I'm like,
I'm going to take the moonbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take this that I love and I'm
going to make sure consumers get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but most farmers most farmers in
California aren't vertically integrated.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to sell their weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to sell their weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so if you're vertically
integrated, then you can have some
[SPEAKER_01]: uniqueness and you can choose like he
could choose to take things that he
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't want to share and you can only
come to his stores to get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no fair motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and a lot of people are cut off
and a lot of people's top shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries top shelf used to be six to
20 like fighters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, done by small scale people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was constantly filling the top
shelf because that was the top shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now all those people are fucking cut off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what used to be the midsy shelf is now
top shelf for more money.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those people are looking for new
fucking jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so a lot of the best weed
got cut off from consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, before they could even smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can't like, I don't know,
you can't you can't get real haze in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you can't get real sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's starting to make a comeback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it'll start forcing itself on some
shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's only but then there's all this
stuff, too, where it's like these
[SPEAKER_01]: vertically integrated companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're going to get from Jungle
Boys or whoever, you're probably going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get mostly their weed that they're growing
because they want to sell their weed
[SPEAKER_01]: through their outlet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, you know, you get the selection
from them, you know, and a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries have captured markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're getting is you're getting a
lot of commercially grown weed that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're trying to grow for cheap and get a
minimum level of quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're trapped because you can
only there's only, you know, 700 stores in
[SPEAKER_01]: California and you got to buy it in one of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't really get great deals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you end up like getting a bunch of
expensive commercial.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that access to that actual top self,
top shelf, that actual fire that was
[SPEAKER_01]: treated deliciously and grown perfectly
with organic or salt or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the little things done the right
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even get to see that anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, what's funny is all these
American beer companies were never winning
[SPEAKER_01]: any any beer awards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you know that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these all these like international
competitions, obviously, like Michelob and
[SPEAKER_01]: Milwaukee's best and Budweiser and all
that were never winning any gold medals at
[SPEAKER_01]: any of these at any of these competitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Beast wasn't winning medals.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they made their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made their own category, American
Lager.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so now a bunch of these companies have
gold medals because they were only fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: competing against themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they were competing against other
microbreweries and places from Belgium and
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany and all that shit, they had no
chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their beer wasn't as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you're getting the same thing here
where you're getting all these big factory
[SPEAKER_01]: farms and they're like, do you want old
style?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want old Milwaukee?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want Michelob?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want Budweiser?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want Coors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, oh, you want some Hedy?
[SPEAKER_01]: How about some Heineken?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some Amstel Light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get an import.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you're competing against.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually can't get these little you
can't get these little things where the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality really matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until they open that stuff up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing for yourself,
I said it before, don't emulate some big
[SPEAKER_01]: farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cutting corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing things that only work at
scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's a there's a I mean,
it's I don't want to get too technical
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm trying to keep it general
enough that like, you know, it stays
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly popular because I don't know how
many people are actual growers on this
[SPEAKER_01]: thing versus just smokers or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's it's it's there's an aspect
where it's like plants don't drink the
[SPEAKER_01]: same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to like just automate
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is microclimates even.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we learn this and reversing a
shitload.
[SPEAKER_04]: How one clone to the next clone won't
reverse the same way, even if they're two
[SPEAKER_04]: feet apart from each other or a foot apart
from each other, getting the same exact
[SPEAKER_04]: feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Microclimates are a real thing,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of those big rooms, the
microclimates are really different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I mean, we haven't even
talked about spectrum, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that has a big if you're not growing with
with the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the best lights to this day is
still the single ended old school Horlux
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these grown under double ended
and stuff like that, like a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are choosing spectrums that give
the most weight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not blends that give a better quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and because because we're not in
a position yet, it's like such a regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: and taxed industry that the best isn't
allowed to bubble to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's controlled by dispensaries,
by disposed, by burner, by people
[SPEAKER_01]: popularizing things, by celebrities
stepping in and people throwing their
[SPEAKER_01]: money around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why that's why if you're if
you're bummed at how the weed sucks in
[SPEAKER_01]: clubs, that's why.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because consumer choice has gone way down
since two fifteen.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are at an hour and a half right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dang.
[SPEAKER_04]: People want to start winding it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could start doing the shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to take some questions or I could
take some questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I could talk to maybe I'll talk
for five or ten minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though we're winding it down,
because I haven't I haven't talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But aside from nutrition and environment,
which we kind of talked about a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: before, the spectrum that the plants grow
under makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could probably be its own whole
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just in general, plants developed
underneath the sun, which has all the
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum all the time, everything from UV
to, you know, every color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where most indoor lights are on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're approximations of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have relatively narrow spectrums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you put plants underneath them and
they grow vastly differently depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: what kind of light they're exposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to 20 years ago when there wasn't
all these other lights, we would grow one
[SPEAKER_01]: light of metal halide and the buds would
come out half the size, but they would
[SPEAKER_01]: burn better and they'd be way frostier
than the HPS stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you see all this stuff with ceramics
and LEDs and this and that and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like different plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants respond to like a different
different types of light and do well
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants do phenomenal under one type
of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like you move them and you think,
oh, I'm going to put them under this and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to do great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they hate it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're not getting sometimes
you'd see people where they were growing
[SPEAKER_01]: all these straight HPS's and then they'd
have straight up old school metal halides
[SPEAKER_01]: like hanging from the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean the vertical ones?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vertical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to give a different spectrum,
like not to be the majority of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just to shine some blue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plants had that to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you remember like the Krusty Buckets?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy swore if you didn't have 25%
metal halide light, you couldn't get those
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of huge plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He swore if you had all HPS, you'd get
shit of your weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to get the size and the frost,
you needed some blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's partially why the old HPS
single ended.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people considered them to be the
best all around light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were the standard because they
had 25% more blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at their spectrum versus like a
double ended right now that's HPS and the
[SPEAKER_01]: HPS is almost all orange and red.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very little UV, very little.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have a bunch of plants like my
headband and my sours and dog and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and you grow them under
different lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew the dog once under pure ceramic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cut it at 85 days and it still had white
hairs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what's weird is that I grew
the dog shit under that same light and it
[SPEAKER_01]: finished two weeks earlier than it
normally would.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a different spectrum?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the CMA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally the dog shit would go 12 or 13
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew it under pure 3100 ceramic metal
halides.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was done in 70 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every hair turned fully ripened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got beautiful pics of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shaved two weeks off, but the same
spectrum made the dog go two weeks longer
[SPEAKER_01]: than I've ever taken her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never taken the dog 85 days in my
life, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, she's, she's 65, she's 63 to 70
and she's pretty done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I finally cut her and I gave up
tons of white hairs all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, maybe like as a,
as a final thing, if you're trying to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: heads, spectrum plays a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Food plays a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your style definitely helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like less is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a lot of ways, like just enough and
nothing more is a better style than like,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's give it way too much and pump it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's supersize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, let's run hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I don't, that's not going
to, that might give you better weight,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I doubt it'll give you better,
better weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so, and that's a lot of
times, like what, what it happens is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: like whether it's drying or curing or
growing or your nutrition or your
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, like growing the same strains
over and over, they're your favorites and
[SPEAKER_01]: learning why some rips, they come out
amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some rips, you're like, eh,
you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause even good growers get, they get the
ant runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, people, people are still
using shit other than LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think LEDs have come a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still not convinced they're better
than a blend of other light.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have never even tried LED lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if any LED light sponsors want to
sponsor, I'll give it a fucking try.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I tend to like CMH quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I think that LEDs are great for,
for various aspects of heat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I, do I have, I started seeing a lot of
nice weed under them and did they have
[SPEAKER_01]: good applications?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, but I still think some of the best
heads you can ever grow are off an old
[SPEAKER_01]: school Hortilux single ended bulb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of award winning weed and
a lot of fire came out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole indoor sour era, the whole
indoor Kush era, the whole indoor purple
[SPEAKER_01]: era, all grown under those bulbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I always hated fucking Hortilux.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a chick that was running it and
they were so anti fucking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was retarded how anti cannabis that
company was and how much money they made
[SPEAKER_04]: off cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, well, you know, there's
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a, like we could wind it down,
but I'll tell a story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I live in Mendo and one time I was
friends with the, I was friends with the
[SPEAKER_01]: produce guy at our Safeway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was one point in Willets where
that Safeway sold more organic produce
[SPEAKER_01]: than any Safeway in the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there was so many fucking of us,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this guy, he tells me this funny story
of this guy from Reynolds comes in,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this Safeway was the number one
selling turkey bag store for Reynolds
[SPEAKER_01]: turkey bags in the entire country.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: He couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came out there to figure out what the
hell is going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are people cooking so many fucking
turkeys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are people cooking?
[SPEAKER_01]: They had no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like this zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have more, like, can we spread what
we're doing here to other parts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because our sales are through the fucking
roof, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they found out it was all for
weed, like the dude's face just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, he was just so bummed,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but it was, it was like, because back
then you couldn't get like turkey bags in
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 or a hundred packs like you can today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would have to go to the store and like
the turkey turkey, they came in like two
[SPEAKER_01]: or three packs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had, you know, an indoor and 20
pound, you had to buy 10 bat, 10 boxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're at the store, you know,
and it's like buying like lube or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, you want to get other shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: I never got the turkey bag fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's not like it really kept smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was a bag that fit a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could tie it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, the thing is with fluffy weed,
if you didn't get the bigger turkey bag,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could not have enough of a tail to
make a knot and seal it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Off of a full pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, where do you get a bag that can
fit a pound?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it's like, you grow Kush or
something or, you know, Urkel,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get a, a tight pound.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grow diesel and it's going to be like
a, a tall pound.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's an aspect to it where it's
like, it just became the standard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what days of fighting over fucking
sizes of bags and weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so the amount, what's crazy is
that like, will the, will it's Safeway
[SPEAKER_01]: learned and they just had, I mean,
they would just, they would, they would
[SPEAKER_01]: just buy them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would have immense amounts of the
shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, such a huge seller for so
long, because there wasn't, eventually
[SPEAKER_01]: companies started making where you can go
to the hydro store and you can buy like 25
[SPEAKER_01]: or 50 or a hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like something you could
purchase there and not be so embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you had to, but back in the day you
had to just go into the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you fucking got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how it fits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so yeah, I guess we've been on,
I mean, we've been, the reason why we
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to about this is because we thought
that and we could get deeper into it so
[SPEAKER_01]: you can always reach out to us on our
discord which Matt will plug or you can
[SPEAKER_01]: reach out to us on IG or whatever but
there's a lot of different strategies I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't want to nerd out too hard but
there's a lot of depth to what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: weed you're trying to grow and what your
goals are for it right and how you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: feed it and how you want to treat it and
it matters you know and so don't just look
[SPEAKER_01]: online at someone you think is killing it
and just feel like oh I figured it all out
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to ask me more questions I'm good
I'll just replicate this one method yeah I
[SPEAKER_01]: know all I need to know yeah because a lot
of times there's a lot of issues with them
[SPEAKER_01]: you know so you know so yeah I mean Matt
I'm not very good at doing the plugs Matt
[SPEAKER_01]: do the plug on the discord and the whatnot
you've got it so our discord you have to
[SPEAKER_04]: go to Google type in breeders syndicate
patreon and that's how you find us we have
[SPEAKER_04]: our discord we have all kinds of
additional features at the discord that we
[SPEAKER_04]: can enjoy together we're always there
shooting the shit talking fucking around
[SPEAKER_04]: posting pics just being obnoxious I mean
I'm being obnoxious under I try to be as
[SPEAKER_04]: obnoxious I can't be and we have rights
eco.com I promise I'm gonna get the
[SPEAKER_04]: Hawaiian lights hybrids up there's only
three up right now we were having problems
[SPEAKER_04]: figuring out why they weren't displaying
and hopefully they'll that's fixed I think
[SPEAKER_04]: so hopefully those will be up there and
you can grab them this weekend my
[SPEAKER_04]: apologies for being late a week or two
weeks maybe I think what else is there
[SPEAKER_04]: speak easy seed bank all of our friends
around there go check it out go show
[SPEAKER_01]: support and I'll plug to after years of
not dealing with it I have my follower
[SPEAKER_01]: list and I accepted thousands of new
people I also rejected a shit ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: people so if you got rejected maybe who
knows maybe I was in a bad mood maybe you
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't have enough posts maybe whatever
you can always message me and say hey dude
[SPEAKER_01]: I listen add me you know I'll try to keep
up on it from now on we're gonna try to
[SPEAKER_01]: create more content basically we're just
trying to shoot the shit about culture
[SPEAKER_01]: history and growing better wheat yeah and
so you can always ask us questions you can
[SPEAKER_01]: always hit us up on IG if you have ideas
for shows that you might want to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about maybe it takes us a while to get
them but you know we want to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: what you want to hear you know and and so
you know some of it'll be can be
[SPEAKER_01]: user-generated you can always ask us
longer questions and get better responses
[SPEAKER_01]: on the discourse you know and we talk
about various subjects and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's easier it's easy to get there so
you know we're trying to do our best we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to do a little different podcast
than most or you know live or whatever and
[SPEAKER_01]: just basically like you know just have it
be like a little bit about culture and
