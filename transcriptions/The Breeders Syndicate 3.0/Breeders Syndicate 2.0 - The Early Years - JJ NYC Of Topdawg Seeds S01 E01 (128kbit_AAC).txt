[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_01]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-so-dog, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided to add in this JJ New York
interview because there's some really good
[SPEAKER_00]: info in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few technical difficulties in
the beginning, and yeah, just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: apologize for that in advance,
but there's good info in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: JJ's been an old friend for a long time,
early member of the chem crew family,
[SPEAKER_00]: and always has good insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much, just dealing with the normal
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, there's a couple of things I
wanted to talk to you about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: One being the G-Zil.
[SPEAKER_02]: G-Zil.
[SPEAKER_04]: The G-Zil is Super Skunk Chem V,
to my knowledge.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: You stated it was Super Skunk,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be a Super Skunk S1, we don't
know, because there's no Chem V coming out
[SPEAKER_02]: of the progeny at all in any of the S1.
[SPEAKER_04]: To my knowledge, that came out of a Chem V
mother, though, a Chem V flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was told by Greg that it came out of the
Super Skunk flower, that the Chem V
[SPEAKER_02]: hermed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I was told the opposite,
but maybe I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either one of us could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greg didn't keep good notes, as we know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's coming from those guys,
you know, him and the Weasel both.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could ask the same question twice and
get two different answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fact, dude.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But have you grown the mass Super Skunk
ever?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I have never grown mass Super Skunk,
never had it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because with the speculation that the mass
Super Skunk is with the sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of have a couple of discrepancies
about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the mass Super Skunk, if you ever
grown it, it grows kind of medium height,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's a single cola with a very thick
stem.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, so like, the theory that it would
be part of the Chem Dog, with the Chem Dog
[SPEAKER_04]: making the sour diesel, the growth
thought, the growth structure,
[SPEAKER_04]: is just, is way off.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you've ever, if you've grown Chem
91 next to sour diesel, like, the growth,
[SPEAKER_04]: the sativa growth on the sour diesel is
just, you know, if you've grown it,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 90 days from Chem 91, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if the theory of the Super Skunk went
into it, then where does all that sativa
[SPEAKER_04]: growth come from?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, unless it's a recessive trait,
but I kind of disagree with that because
[SPEAKER_04]: I've grown the DNL that I think that is
part of the sour diesel, and it grows
[SPEAKER_04]: exactly the same, just that really
stretchy sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to top it off and just branch it
out and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's just my view.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with some of your DDNL,
and I saw a lot of sour traits in it as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought, and I was going to ask you
that because I thought a while back that
[SPEAKER_04]: you had grown some of those DNL crossings,
and I wanted to get your opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was dank, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still sitting on some beans.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't brought them out in a long time,
but I got so many different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been working on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to try to get into it soon,
especially with all this skunk
[SPEAKER_04]: controversies that are going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's speaking of controversies over
this whole thing with fucking giraffe
[SPEAKER_04]: neck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dick neck, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if I was Skunk VA, I would have
just ripped his head off right there on
[SPEAKER_04]: the spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised he didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: That dude is just a mellow dude,
and he's the kind of dude that once he
[SPEAKER_04]: snaps, there's no stopping him.
[SPEAKER_04]: His arms are the size of my thighs.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like Popeye.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like a wrestler.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't believe what Joint Brett told
him to suck his dick or something online.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but he went up to his booth,
and they had some kind of conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he came outside, and I was in a
circle with the Swamp Boys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bronson was there, and he just like
fucking lost his mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I thought I was going to have to
fight him at first.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I became like his therapist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I kind of had like a shred of
sympathy for the guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was saying he went to jail and blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone hates him and how he wants to be
accepted and all this other bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were the voice of reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually you're swinging on people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told him, listen, stop fronting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, you know, he's handing a jar
of skunk around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, yo, you think that's real
roadkill?
[SPEAKER_04]: I told him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I give him some kind of skunk wand or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you smell it, I mean,
it kind of has that smell to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the bud structure itself is like very
kind of leafy and sativa-like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you smoke it, it tastes like
straight up hay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not saying that to be a hater.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm giving you my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I told him, I'm like, hey,
listen, if you had something that great,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would congratulate you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you're just thinking that
everyone's saying shit to be a hater.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm giving you my honest opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone that I talked to that was in
that expo that saw that stuff was just
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he brought it to Emerald Cup,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people that touched the underside
of the jar got some orange shit on their
[SPEAKER_02]: fingers that smelled like real skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't have any of that going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Poor fella.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's charting in dangerous territories,
fucking around with Duke and Skunky.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't entangle either one of those
dudes, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens at the next show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it boil over a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's all these other guys that
say they have the roadkill.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had the original Super Skunk back in
like 1995.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let me tell you, when you just cracked
that jar, it just permeated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I had gotten the cut years later.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just wasn't the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't give out those same kind of
turks or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a different cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cuts just dud out after a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's starting to happen with the sour
diesel because everyone asks me,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, where's that wall?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's that sour diesel at with that old
time sour diesel?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you got to figure it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like 25 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how long that cut is now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just been given from person to
person, from room to room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think cuts adapt to the room that
they're in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So your sour diesel is going to come out
different than my sour diesel now.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you start giving out cuts and I start
giving out cuts, after a while,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there could be some type of
genetic drift that might happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not anything drastically, but there just
seems to be these small sort of things
[SPEAKER_04]: that seem to be missing from the sour
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, acclimates from room to room to
room to room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that thing's so fucking old.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we had the original underdog,
which was Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now times a 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just went bad on us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we had the cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after a while, it just it only
showed glimmers of itself, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: when it was really, really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was still, you know, the hardest
went down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was harder to clone and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after a while, my son was like,
he gave to me, I did a little bit of work
[SPEAKER_04]: with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my son was like, listen, I'm just
going to let it go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you just let it go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've heard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember just buying from buying.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a stuff called the wheelchair,
the wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_04]: And back in the day, that's just,
you know, was given bomb.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the same thing after a while,
you just could not get the same batches
[SPEAKER_04]: just from buying it after a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the same people were growing it and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's the wheelchair?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just some type of local strain that
was sold to New York City in the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, back then we didn't really have,
you know, names weren't really,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the thing that they are now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I have no idea what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about I-95.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think I've seen so I think I've
seen some stuff referenced like as the
[SPEAKER_04]: wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the crickler or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to have to really find out,
you know, where that really came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that, you know, that stuff
came from Amsterdam back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about I-95.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the other one that I wanted
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about the history of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's a money Mike strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And originally he bred that back.
[SPEAKER_04]: In like 2014, we brought it to the Denver
Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last Denver Cup was 2014.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we and we brought that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was it was a legend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stardog male times the Triangle Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he bred that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We brought that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were friends with Tara Rojo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we went over to Mindful and he gave us
a tour.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, and so we gave him some
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave him some stardog seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got some I-95 seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we, you know, we're just
trying, you know, to help the guy out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not knowing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, going further back,
he had invited us to share his booth in
[SPEAKER_04]: one of the first few Denver Cups.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might have been 2011.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we, you know, I always,
you know, respected Phil and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: thanked him for, you know, helping us and
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we gave him seeds to, you know,
to play with and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, he grew those seeds out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then see, this is where it starts
getting kind of fudgy because.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I confronted him, you know,
he says, you know, that he had started the
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds and left Mindful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really sure, but we gave the seeds
to Phil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then before we know it, one of his
workers, Matt Ross, started a seed company
[SPEAKER_04]: basically with the seeds that we gave him.
[SPEAKER_04]: We gave Phil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Phil claims that he stole them from
Mindful, took them out and started playing
[SPEAKER_04]: with them at his house and all.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, we held Phil responsible
for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he claims that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, he like he hired the same
guy to run some kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: get some kind of job in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to me, I think that, you know,
he kind of set him up to kind of be the
[SPEAKER_04]: bad guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while Phil spread those genetics all
through his his, you know, his dealings
[SPEAKER_04]: with eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he's got the egrets thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he does, you know, other smaller stuff
on the side.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I know he got some stuff in
Baltimore and there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, so, you know,
they did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we had the elite guys,
which those guys are friends of ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're good friends of mine,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, they took a pack of I-95s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, they did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they bought them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, but then, you know, they saw what
what these guys did with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they and they started doing the same
crosses that they but they didn't sell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't sell them, but they were
giving them away.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just even doing giving them away,
you're trying to make a name for yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way that I look at it is if,
you know, if you buy if you're given a
[SPEAKER_04]: pack of I-95 Chem D, you think you're ever
ever going to buy one from me?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: The chances are not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you guys ever release the I-95 Chem D
or the I-95 publicly?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, I'm selling them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, yes, I'm selling them now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody go grab your I-95 Chem D from
JJ Top Dog Seeds right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, basically, I took, you know,
I took F2s from them guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I mean, they gave me F1s and I
made F2s with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I started crossing into some of
the different other strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Money Mike also did a remake of
his I-95 into the Chem D and made the Chem
[SPEAKER_04]: D95s.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's Money Mike's take on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my take on it is just an F2 on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I took their, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I took their original,
the Chem D, the Chem D reigning,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, is the one that I F2 that I had
gotten.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they had, I mean, and I went over
there with those and went after Phil left.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Matt and his brother, Jackson,
both gave me seeds, gave me buds,
[SPEAKER_04]: told me how much they loved me,
you know, the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he went around and did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Wave Gem did the same exact
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They came up to our booth in Boston and
told us how much they loved us and blah,
[SPEAKER_04]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Money Mike wanted to punch the guy out
because he was playing around with,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, he was getting into dangerous
territory at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I told him, you know, you better just
back off and, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're getting a little bit too close.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he got all stupid and did the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So everyone tells you that they love you,
how much they respect you, this and that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come and kiss your ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get your gear.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they want to be like you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just go and just, you know,
just try to copy all the work that you've
[SPEAKER_04]: done.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it just seems to be a,
you know, a common trait, you know what I
[SPEAKER_04]: mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a different world.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least on the forums, like people would
get called out all the time by a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, now, you know, it's just as
easy to, you know, just block someone.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one really, you know, has the respect
or the decency anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, back in the day, it was a lot
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot different than now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard of that Wave Gen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a new company?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just some guys, I think there were some
kid that was at a Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's up there in Maine now.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll keep my eye out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Wave Gen.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's changed his name a few times.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's gotten deleted.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and then you got Greenpoint,
another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he took the I-95.
[SPEAKER_04]: He took the Stardog.
[SPEAKER_04]: He did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wave Genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hey, I got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't know what DNL is in
the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you go over it for people?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as far as I know, the DNL originally
originated was the RFK Skunk, which the
[SPEAKER_04]: Weasel Mike and Gabby went down to a dead
show at RFK and scored a bag of kind bud
[SPEAKER_04]: and found, I don't know, like eight or 10
seeds or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they both agreed to split the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they did it, they actually put
all the seeds out on the table and they
[SPEAKER_04]: eat one by one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when the Weasel, he wound up getting,
I don't know, like three different phenos.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's when I first met him in Central
Park.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was Skunk One, Skunk Two, Skunk Three.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what he called them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a friend of his wound up getting
like some type of, some NF.
[SPEAKER_04]: NL seeds and some Hawaiian seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he wound up having those seeds and he
gave him some of those RFK clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he made his own strain,
combining the three.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he just called it the NL.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, it might've had some NL in
it, but it was mostly Sativa dominant in
[SPEAKER_04]: structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Hawaiian, it kind of had these
tropical, like tropical skunky tones a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of, you get little bits, you know,
you get taste in the sour sometimes,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was a strain that he grew
exclusively.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that he gave it back to the
Weasel McGraw.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that's what I suspect was
in the room when, you know, those seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: weren't made, but were found originally,
I mean, in the 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, I mean, I used to sell weed for
the Weasel.
[SPEAKER_04]: He grew it, I sold it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he had a few, he had Vondo and there
were a few other people that would Weasel
[SPEAKER_04]: in and try to buy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was like a race, because I
would, you know, he would only get like a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple pounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was like, you know, you just had to
grab everything that he had at the time,
[SPEAKER_04]: just cash him out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this way you had control of all of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, back in the day,
people would just come in and just want to
[SPEAKER_04]: buy it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would be like, I can't sell it to
you all because, you know, I like to
[SPEAKER_04]: spread it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would sell it to other people that
did me favors.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when I get something in,
you know, I'll hit you off, you can make
[SPEAKER_04]: some money, just do me a favor,
you know, save me, you know, this or that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you could use it as like a
bartering tool to, you know, get other
[SPEAKER_04]: favors from people.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know if the RFK is still around or
is that long gone?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's been long gone.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then really recently, they lost the
DNL within the last like, two years or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I mean, that's why I was thinking
about trying to, you know, fall back on
[SPEAKER_04]: some of those seeds I've made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: And see if I could pull anything out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like the original.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be real cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Real cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because really, I wanted to try to reverse
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Into the ninety one and see what would
happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I first started growing in
like ninety nine, you know, I,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I had been selling weed for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And any time I had some anything that was
super kill and I found seeds, I would save
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then at one time I had a really bad
ass collection from the 80s and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the cops took it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got busted.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wound up starting a new one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then so when I started that one,
when I started getting the chem dog,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, every once in a while,
you might find a seed or two in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would save them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I started, I popped a few of
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, back then, there was no really
such thing as the sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, but, you know, looking
back, I had found some stuff that was very
[SPEAKER_04]: sour, like very sourish.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, and I remember I had I had
something happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we were we were we had closed
down the grow or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had just popped these seeds and I
sexed them and I gave them and I gave the
[SPEAKER_04]: clone to my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, listen, I was like,
I said, the only thing I know that this is
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know, came from out of the chem
dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I gave it to him and he grew it out
and that became the guava, but not the
[SPEAKER_04]: guava of today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he called that cut the guava,
but it was kind of very sourish and all
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he ran it and then eventually lost it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and then years later, I wound up
doing the star dog and I had gifted my
[SPEAKER_04]: friend some seeds to give to Andre
Grossman, the photographer of high times.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he he grew him out and he found a
female that was today's guava.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what happened was somehow while he
well, what happened was they like that cut
[SPEAKER_04]: so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the time they had high times,
they had the Kyle Cushman strawberry call.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they actually had they had a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a plant in the in the office.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like anyone that went into the office,
if they liked you enough, they would cut
[SPEAKER_04]: you or cut you a couple of clones right
off the plant in the office and let you go
[SPEAKER_04]: home with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so eventually the same thing happened
with the guava.
[SPEAKER_04]: And both the guava and the strawberry
crock became the the office strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: So years later, like I was saying,
the same guy that named the guava tells me
[SPEAKER_04]: that he got the guava that he got the
guava back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we eventually find out that it comes
full circle back from the high times,
[SPEAKER_04]: guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was how the guava kind of got
its name of today.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was originally some type of brush
set.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I didn't get to ever finish
it out, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one of them I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then another one I didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I did get to finish one out,
but then I had popped another seed and
[SPEAKER_04]: that was the seed that I gave my friend
that came from the same batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, was the stardog guava similar in
terms or anything to the other guava?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the guava of today is more chem
fourish.
[SPEAKER_04]: What am I thinking?
[SPEAKER_04]: More of the chem fourish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas the other one was more more kind
of ninety one ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little more fuel.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little more fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: The original one was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you still have any of those old the
purple Afghan cross?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you did a purple stardog with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: With a purple stardog with what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was British Empire's purple
Afghan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never really I never popped any of those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sitting on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I did some.
[SPEAKER_04]: Into the Chem D all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I did some into the original
Hayes, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those all could be real.
[SPEAKER_02]: That Afghan original Hayes could be
fucking real interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wound up flowering out some of that
stuff and some of it was green and some of
[SPEAKER_04]: it was purple just by semantics,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wound up using a male and,
you know, I fucked up and never made f
[SPEAKER_04]: twos out of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but I do have that just just the
crosses into the stardog in the Chem D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would be fascinating to see pop
back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but the purple stardog that I that I
made, you know, the purple came from the
[SPEAKER_04]: trade dog male and the purple probably
came from the Afghan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was a sensei seed Afghan.
[SPEAKER_04]: The old Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghan one, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, you know, looking back into
that, that wasn't really like a true
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivar as in one string.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was a mix of their best
Afghanis or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even like looking back into the maple
leaf, I think even like the maple leaf
[SPEAKER_04]: really wasn't really really like one
stable strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there were were a variety of
different phenos in there because if you
[SPEAKER_04]: if you look back into the seed,
the seed bank catalog, they actually offer
[SPEAKER_04]: that like a 50 pack or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's more of like a breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they don't really I mean,
but it sounded like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was, you know, a lot of different
different varieties in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the one guy that they talk about maple
leaf, they were whoever they called one
[SPEAKER_04]: guy maple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of the phenos that he was growing at the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess all that was based off his
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've always found that a lot of
the stuff that was listed as maple leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: indica like that was used tend to look
like Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if they have a similar
parentage that way back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, because I look back and
I think, you know, if you look into the
[SPEAKER_04]: catalogs on the Afghani one, it says it's
like a mix of their three or four best
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghanis or whatever, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I grew it, it kind of grew very
fast and single cola, kind of short,
[SPEAKER_04]: medium height.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it didn't really have a really the
turps on it weren't really super strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of subtle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's why I figured it would be a
good outcross to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Outcross into the chem because it wouldn't
be dominant, you know, because it kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: had like a kind of a medicine,
a little medicine thing going through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was it was decent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I smoked the flower, but,
you know, it wasn't anything that would
[SPEAKER_04]: compare to the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the structure, you know, definitely
added, you know, because it gave you that
[SPEAKER_04]: really thick stem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and all the all the the calyx,
the blood ratio, you know, there wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: much leaf on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were you were one of the first guys
I saw from not necessarily the modern era,
[SPEAKER_02]: but prior to the modern era that was
actually using like the Northern Lights,
[SPEAKER_02]: the super skunks, the Afghani one shit
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that always inspired me to go in that
direction for those baselines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was always a big sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see fan back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, their genetics are not the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, they were.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, but if you're looking back,
most of that stuff they got from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that stuff was seed bank stuff
that, you know, when Neville was in jail
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, they bailed him out and,
you know, they gave him money or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm pretty sure that that was the story
behind that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the best stuff there is as far as
baselines go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if people don't grow that stuff,
they won't have an idea of a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: traits and modern stuff like they're
they're they don't have a good base
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And looking back, like I know people,
you know, they've talked to the drunkers
[SPEAKER_04]: and they admitted that they've lost all
their mother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, someone like Adam Dunn,
he was working with them back in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he knows firsthand a lot of that
stuff that went on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, he left after he left.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and then I don't know who else
was doing a I don't know who else was
[SPEAKER_04]: doing a breathing back in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, because you used to be able
to get those cellophane cord packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they upgraded to the box with the
bubble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the box and the bubble.
[SPEAKER_04]: All that stuff was junk and leading up
leading up until today, because my friend,
[SPEAKER_04]: he had bought a pack of Jack Carrere,
like, you know, the year it won the cup or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, he grew it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was selling the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And after a while, they did this kind of
people got sick of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, yeah, it started.
[SPEAKER_04]: They told him to stop doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, oh, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll kill it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have the whole pack left.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, years later, I said,
hey, why don't you look for that pack?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I lost it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, so then I was able to grab a pack
of the boxes and I gave him a pack of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack Carrere and he grew it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was it wasn't this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was really it was junk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think really by then, that's when a
lot of people started outsourcing to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of that stuff comes back.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's kind of like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack, me, they have a Jack Turk to it,
but it's, you know, grows very sativa
[SPEAKER_04]: like, but, you know, it's kind of wispy
and I don't know, I just call it like
[SPEAKER_04]: generic Amsterdam weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like even like Adam says, you know,
like the Jack itself is like, I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: know, like a 12 way cross, you know,
a 12 way cross or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's four things that just
cross back into each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And after a while, this becomes like,
you know, a genetic mess almost where it
[SPEAKER_04]: just comes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just very generic in what it's
producing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It becomes a muddled mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like we've got a minute left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you want to get in,
my man?
[SPEAKER_04]: We got into pretty much everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised we're able to squeeze it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hey, it's a pleasure having you on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're one of the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad we were able to go over these
things and just, you know, iron out some
[SPEAKER_04]: of the confusion that might have been out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk soon, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
