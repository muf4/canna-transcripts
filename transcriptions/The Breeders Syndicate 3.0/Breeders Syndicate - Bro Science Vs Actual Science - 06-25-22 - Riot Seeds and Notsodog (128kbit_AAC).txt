[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: I started a little early just to let the
crowd build up before old sonat dog gets
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How y'all doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck is up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just looking at this old Hemp BC
catalog and thinking how nice would it be
[SPEAKER_00]: To have some of that nl5 purple indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be really cool And I
think I think we might have just made some
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, but I would be interested to see
what the The BC purple indica is like how
[SPEAKER_00]: much different it is I'm like this nl5
Hawaiian indica now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the BCC Co stuff which is Probably
five by two not just five, but we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know for sure Either way very cool
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll Anyway, so yeah, I was just
shooting this it trying to build shit up
[SPEAKER_00]: before dude gets here But yeah So what's a
haps ladies and gents today?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are gonna talk about I actually haven't
written down I wrote things down this time
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to be more organized for y'all I'm
not usually So this is gonna be it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: start off as the bro science episode Which
is essentially like different things you
[SPEAKER_00]: hear in cannabis that like you're pretty
sure are real But they just turned out to
[SPEAKER_00]: be old wives tales.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to any old wives hanging around
Yeah, so we thought that would be cool
[SPEAKER_00]: when someone gave us that idea and I think
that's That's that's what's up From the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian light stuff probably the dog shit
Hawaiian lights just because of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: unique possibilities that Come from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's probably gonna be the one
in the bomb threat of course cuz bomb
[SPEAKER_00]: threats the shit Here we go Here's the so
not dog as Darby lapping up a pool of
[SPEAKER_00]: water all loud as fuck Evening yo yo yo yo
yo yo yo yo What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hiding from the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a fan on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the audio weird at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, okay good I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, does it smell good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm sorry Brian just brought her
some some stuff from Trader Joe's
[SPEAKER_00]: someone's a strawberry lemon scrub,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: I Wish I had a sense of smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Yeah So what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I wrote down a bunch of stuff today
to go over and I don't know if you had a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to write anything down or do you
have anything you want to Just start off
[SPEAKER_03]: the jump with we could start off the jump.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean So we thought we would talk for a
bit about Bro science versus real science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a quick I don't know what you'd
call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just say this is you know This is what we
know as best as we know it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am often wrong constantly wrong and and
You know shit updates all the time So this
[SPEAKER_00]: is as best as we know it right now as we
were trying to bring it to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: but If you find something different and
have a strong opinion on it, let us know
[SPEAKER_00]: we're always open to new Suggestions and
ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it is because there's a Yeah,
I mean that that could go for almost any
[SPEAKER_03]: show when we talk about history or this or
that or whatever Yeah, we're trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: give you like a version that we hope is
pretty accurate You know and and so on and
[SPEAKER_03]: so forth, but there's areas where you can
misspeak You know or just areas where that
[SPEAKER_03]: later on you get a detail comes on That
changes your perspective on something too.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So For a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, actually our buddy just said we
should maybe even talk about that like
[SPEAKER_03]: flush versus no flush Yeah, that's
actually a really good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the whole idea is more of like now
that cannabis is becoming legal And
[SPEAKER_03]: medical and all this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an aspect where actual science is
getting used on it Yeah where for a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time the science that was getting used on
it was actually pretty limited and so We
[SPEAKER_03]: were left with a lot of observational
stuff Yeah, and you know with like
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding and stuff like that and Punnett
squares all that like like taking other
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge from other forms of plant
breeding and work and Trying to apply it
[SPEAKER_03]: to weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, and it's only really been
Probably the last ten years I would say
[SPEAKER_03]: Five someone asked me to bleep You know
five five maybe ten years that it's opened
[SPEAKER_03]: up enough that Like more science is being
done on things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and not only that not only more
science is being done But like more
[SPEAKER_03]: reputable scientists in their field are
willing to get involved Yeah, and give
[SPEAKER_03]: their opinions on stuff You know and and
so like kind of like a theme of like what
[SPEAKER_03]: what we knew then versus what we know now
Yes, you know and because a lot of this
[SPEAKER_03]: information and you know history and
otherwise the science part is no different
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of It is is oral Yes, it's like it's
passed down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's passed down from older stoners to you
Yeah, you know you hear about it through
[SPEAKER_03]: people you respect and and all this
different types of stuff and so You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's that's kind of how information was
disseminated Yes amongst groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep forums and and little bbs is back in
the day Yeah, or yeah little little friend
[SPEAKER_03]: circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah little friends Circles at the
grow store little circles little this and
[SPEAKER_03]: that the few books or a few stuff or most
people would just read stuff from other
[SPEAKER_03]: disciplines Yeah Right and try to apply it
to weed as best they could adapt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah and so people like even in the sense
of like the even in the sense of like
[SPEAKER_03]: medical information Matt and I were
talking about this where it's like For a
[SPEAKER_03]: long time it was it you know, it still is
it was a schedule one drug And so you
[SPEAKER_03]: needed the DEA Permission to even study it
because you couldn't possess it legally
[SPEAKER_03]: without their say so, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so For like 40 years they would do
this thing where they would only approve
[SPEAKER_03]: studies looking for cannabis harm Yeah,
so if you said your study was I want to
[SPEAKER_03]: look and see if it shrinks Matt's balls
and Gives him anxiety and shortens his
[SPEAKER_03]: lifespan.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd be like here's some weed go test
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and they'd find out it absolutely
does So we're but if you wanted to say
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, I want to see if it lowers not so
dogs freaking, you know blood pressure and
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know increases his appetite and
lowers his Lowers is estrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, whatever the case may be they would
deny Yeah, what happened is is that they
[SPEAKER_03]: ended up you got like 40 you got 40 years
plus of science Looking for cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: harms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because they wanted data points that
could prove their case and make keeping it
[SPEAKER_03]: illegal And keeping it the way that it was
to have like scientific backing propaganda
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah So as a result of that we have a lot
of knowledge and we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: extensive studies on what the worst stuff
that cannabis does Because that's all they
[SPEAKER_03]: were looking for but we have relatively
little shit on what it's good for yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and You know and even stuff like,
you know, we're gonna have a upcoming
[SPEAKER_03]: episode where it's all about Aromas and
scents and terpenes and all this different
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff But even just the terpene itself
aspect Yeah, right and like and and the
[SPEAKER_03]: the names behind those things rather than
people just describing aromas Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 years ago people weren't talking turps
Yeah, I still suck at that part myself
[SPEAKER_03]: right or even like knowing what the turps
are knowing how they combine Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I mean like you take art.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only so many primary colors Yeah,
but you start blending those primary
[SPEAKER_03]: colors and you can get all these different
shades Right 16 million something like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and you know to some degree scents
are like that, too You start blending
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes and theals and all these other
things that I'll mispronounce Yeah But you
[SPEAKER_03]: know like when we were getting into
cannabis none of that stuff was being
[SPEAKER_03]: studied on any kind of accessible level.
[SPEAKER_03]: No It just didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, like the closest I saw like when I was
getting in was DJ's or like olfactory But
[SPEAKER_03]: that was entire that was cool,
but that was more like a wine Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: like a training your nose to other things
you might recognize as a scent Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: that wasn't so much science like so a lot
of a lot of bro science ends up just being
[SPEAKER_03]: like Observational shit that may or may
not be right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, like I joked with Matt on
an earlier podcast or whatever that You
[SPEAKER_03]: know back in the day like we used to put
our favorite Nuga Mexican in the resin
[SPEAKER_03]: chamber It resin chambers and you'd smoke
and you'd smoke that Last because the the
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the science was you're gonna
coat that bud and all that unburned THC
[SPEAKER_03]: and resin all that and fucking resin Yeah,
and then the last nug you smoke of your
[SPEAKER_03]: bag is the best one because it's coated
and all that extra free goo That's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get you high Yeah, what's if you scrape
scrape the the resin chamber first and
[SPEAKER_00]: then coat that on the outside of the bud,
too That really helps but that was I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: that was like that was accepted Science
knowledge in my crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah for sure It was super common
common in the 80s and 90s or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see you take your best bud and
you'd ruin it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Right, and then you'd like sit there
and smoke it and burn all funny because it
[SPEAKER_03]: had all this like wet Yeah, you know metal
pipe goo But that was accepted that was
[SPEAKER_03]: that was the accepted thing to do you you
read that was the resin they put that
[SPEAKER_03]: there so you could fit a button and
Resonate the button.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah That's funny, dude Because we didn't
have any science to tell us otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's stunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew that much Yeah, it's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew that much, you know But that that
was accepted, you know, there used to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: thing which is funny now because when you
dig into history Most fire is herm.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean it used to be accepted bro
science, right that You know seeds from
[SPEAKER_03]: hermaphrodites were shittier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah That's that's bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's and that like you don't if you use
that like you could fuck up the line You
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted like straight male female mating
Yeah, that was the way to go and if you
[SPEAKER_03]: you know If you you know popped hermy
seeds the chances that it would be hermy
[SPEAKER_03]: and you'd never be able to get it out So a
lot of people were scared of of beans and
[SPEAKER_00]: buds Yeah, and they also the conclusion
was that herms had low THC every time too,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, yeah And then the Kush and the
sour diesel and like a million phenomenal
[SPEAKER_03]: fireweed is all like hermy bag seed Yeah,
you know, but like we didn't understand
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding enough the science of breeding,
you know, we thought that like If you did
[SPEAKER_03]: a male female, you probably wouldn't get
the herm gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but if you hermed You know not that
if the plant herm did obviously had the
[SPEAKER_03]: gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Cuz it hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, cuz it hurt because it hurt,
you know, it's like That's what it did.
[SPEAKER_03]: It already had the gene in it or it
wouldn't have done it Yeah, that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: special gene that isn't in most cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of read it out the herm gene So
we had to so we had to proto pipes are
[SPEAKER_03]: actually made in one town north of me in
Willets They're still made there a little
[SPEAKER_03]: shop, you know, the proto pipe strangely
enough That was a classic early head shop
[SPEAKER_03]: metal pipe Yeah, you know it had the lid
that went on the top and it had the
[SPEAKER_03]: scraper and it had the little resin
chamber it had the whole thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, yeah and And so, you know,
so a lot of this stuff is like you start
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking and you start learning the legends
and the shit like that around Your little
[SPEAKER_03]: circle and then you start reading some
books, you know and that's kind of where
[SPEAKER_03]: like bro science comes from bro science is
like people observing stuff and Then
[SPEAKER_03]: saying it's true and then other people
around you agree and then it sort of gains
[SPEAKER_03]: weight Yeah, because like a bunch of
people are saying It and then you're
[SPEAKER_03]: telling some you know, some younger person
than you about it and they just buy it
[SPEAKER_03]: hook line and sinker Oh, yeah you know,
so yeah, I mean now obviously like with
[SPEAKER_03]: you know with feminized breeding and stuff
like that like that the whole science of
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, or even like even here's another
bro science thing like Matt and I were
[SPEAKER_03]: chatting about which is You know pale
seeds are bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and the best healthiest most mature
Seeds are all dark and have tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes And there is some truth to like fully
tiger striped seeds are mature for the
[SPEAKER_03]: most part and pale seeds can be immature
Yes, but as any breeder will tell you that
[SPEAKER_03]: that tiger stripe is a skin Yeah,
it's a thin little layer like an onion
[SPEAKER_00]: skin almost on the seed and so if you blow
your seeds like we all do you know like We
[SPEAKER_00]: actually put it through a blower and it
and it blows the the husks off and whatnot
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy for him to get knocked
around and knock the tiger stripe off So
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, and and there's also the fact that
you know, like they're they're little tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: African land-raised seeds that are like
Yeah big that are totally black or totally
[SPEAKER_00]: gray, you know It just really depends on
the region the type the type of pollen the
[SPEAKER_00]: the maturity of the pollen hitting the
plant What part of the plant was making
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed all sorts of stuff goes into
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: So but in the back in the day it was pale
seeds bad Yeah, yeah, and it's still and
[SPEAKER_03]: it still persists I mean I was having a
talk this week with our our our homie
[SPEAKER_03]: Caleb and he was saying that like You know
a lot a lot of seed he throws into the not
[SPEAKER_03]: good pile Yeah, but it would have pretty
damn high germination rates Yeah most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff that like if anything's even
remotely great even if I know that's like
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic on it and it's just what it is I
won't sell it because I know that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just gonna Cause problems people don't
yeah, he'll say, you know, he'll start out
[SPEAKER_03]: with a bunch of dark tiger stripe seeds
And you put them through the blower and
[SPEAKER_03]: you put them in some bags and you handle
them and all that and then at the end
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one or two that have it and the
rest of the pack is is doesn't have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah So, you know, but that was like
straight science like if you got all white
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds was a sign of immaturity What's one
of the most extreme ones you think you've
[SPEAKER_00]: heard when it comes to bro science?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think I started with it with the
with the put resonate your buds,
[SPEAKER_03]: but That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah that one and the and the
hermaphrodism contaminating everything
[SPEAKER_00]: forever more and ruining your weed I had a
good one and this was Early on when I
[SPEAKER_00]: lived in in Isla Vista I had a dude come
up to me at a party and tell me that he
[SPEAKER_00]: shocks his plants with batteries to turn
them purple I think at some point somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: told them that they shocked their plants
Meaning shock it with you know cold or
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme temperatures and he took that to
mean Oh, I put my car battery hooked that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit up fucking jump that shit and turns
it purple So that was one of my favorites
[SPEAKER_00]: that you shock your plants with
electricity to turn them purple there was
[SPEAKER_03]: there was always some and then the issue
is is that you know when it like because
[SPEAKER_03]: when bro science ended it wasn't like it
was amazing either because when actual
[SPEAKER_03]: science started getting into Play before
when all we had was observational traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, almost all breeding was all
selection was done based on Observe
[SPEAKER_03]: observable characteristics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because that's all you had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah grow How did it look what the leaves
look like what the resin content did?
[SPEAKER_03]: How did it burn?
[SPEAKER_03]: What it tastes like and then once you
started getting all this data people
[SPEAKER_03]: started trying to incorporate all this
data Into breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and a lot of them fucked it up I
like that someone brought up the Kool-Aid
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another fave the what and feeding
the plants Kool-Aid to turn them purple
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, or adding adding flavors to the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and make some cherry That way he put
some Kool-Aid powder to the roots Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean now it is the one thing that is
true is that if you do if you do there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: plant that has a propensity to turn purple
Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can shock it sometimes with cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a that's a common one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a common One then that one's
actually true, you know, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's got started mostly when you get some
cold snap nights out here outdoor style
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and you'd see some stuff that had
been green all summer and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_03]: it went dark on you Yeah, all of a sudden
it was fucking black and then you'll see
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll see some people like, you know
Trying all that like pouring ice on top of
[SPEAKER_03]: their weed indoor Yeah, trying to get that
color change because all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_03]: colors important for the last few years
again, you know, yeah Yeah, you know sugar
[SPEAKER_03]: water to make it frosty I don't even I
think most sugar water like the the the
[SPEAKER_03]: pores on the roots are too small to even
absorb it Yeah, it's mostly there to like
[SPEAKER_03]: feed the microbiome or whatever that's in
your soil mass more So than it is to like
[SPEAKER_03]: shoot up your plant, you know,
yeah exactly But but yeah, I mean it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like so all you had back in the day was
legends and people trading information and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's why so many of us like Look look at
like Rob Clark's book like the Bible For a
[SPEAKER_03]: breather because it was lit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like did he have competition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really, I mean later reading book Not
necessarily no other than that one You
[SPEAKER_00]: know during that era later on I mean Greg
Green had his Breeders Bible, but that was
[SPEAKER_00]: much later.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was way way later Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not really no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean he was like basically like the only
person on the hill Yeah, so if you wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: to learn how to breed and how cannabis
even worked You know, that was where you
[SPEAKER_00]: went Yeah, and we got very fortunate that
he got so much of it right for so long we
[SPEAKER_00]: were very fortunate because it could have
been anyone doing that and Getting it very
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong and it probably would have been
passed as You know cannon forever Someone
[SPEAKER_03]: just asked me if I have any advice on
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like pretty general and yeah,
I've grown in greenhouses for decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Yes, but I don't know what But you
know, yeah, there was there was you know
[SPEAKER_03]: There was all this stuff and there was all
this experimentation going on and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: like they were looking for harm in weed
Yeah, and you know nobody knew I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: think when was the first time you even
heard the word CBN or CBG or CBD It was
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty early on but I think most people
didn't know the difference between CBG and
[SPEAKER_03]: CBN at the time You know, you know,
I mean I I like we we got some Like we you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, we used to call it pretend to go we
got bunked a few times by yeah We thought
[SPEAKER_03]: was kind bud and it was gorgeous hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah gorgeous hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was gorgeous hemp Yeah,
it looked like it looked like $400 an
[SPEAKER_03]: ounce weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but the Mac but the green Mexican
got you higher Yeah, but I mean I remember
[SPEAKER_03]: at that time, you know in Chicago or
whatever I didn't even I didn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that hemp had those things Yeah I
didn't even know that hemp looked like
[SPEAKER_00]: weed back then like I didn't even know
that they look they could be confused for
[SPEAKER_00]: each other at all like we In Cal so Cal we
had no experience with hemp except for
[SPEAKER_00]: when they would bring, you know,
this gorgeous looking fucking reddish
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful Frosty indica in and we're like
game and we're paying the same price as
[SPEAKER_00]: the max.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right Yeah pretend to go I mean we
called it ditch weed in Illinois Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it grew in ditches and it grew at
the edges of fields and it grew wild There
[SPEAKER_03]: was a wild population from World War two,
you know all through the Midwest basically
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I didn't I mean, you know now
it's like now now I'd know it was up but
[SPEAKER_03]: then we were so confused Yeah,
it was how how weed that could look that
[SPEAKER_03]: good and yeah, and like you'd smoke it and
smoke You're taking bong hit after bong
[SPEAKER_03]: hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it feels a little funny and you're
like, I don't feel high at all Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and you smoke a joint a Mexican
and you're like, oh it worked Dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: those guys must have been making a killing
selling that it, you know 60 an ounce Well
[SPEAKER_03]: the thing about the thing about my area
Was is that there was brown Mexican and
[SPEAKER_03]: there was green Mexican and anything
better than that was kind bud that went
[SPEAKER_03]: for expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah You know, I mean you like it did the
quality only made the price go up But it
[SPEAKER_03]: was like even the shitty stuff was still
won't go by Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah That's what it was killed me like
ours like it would have way less seeds You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, it was it was really beautiful
looking but it would it was always the
[SPEAKER_00]: same price as the Mexican it would always
blow my mind the Anyone was so dumb they'd
[SPEAKER_00]: sell this for the same price.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you know every single time I'd
get fucking Skunked on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a skunked on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and so there's there's an aspect to
where it's like what's interesting is that
[SPEAKER_03]: So and I don't know why this is
necessarily but it does seem like when
[SPEAKER_03]: with testing Low THC doesn't get you as
high Yeah, but then it also seems like
[SPEAKER_03]: once there's enough THC it doesn't seem to
matter and then when they Too much THC it
[SPEAKER_03]: seems to get in the way Yeah Because most
of our like famous elite strains at least
[SPEAKER_03]: the ones that I personally like to smoke a
bunch Yeah, they seem to come in between
[SPEAKER_03]: 18 and 25 mostly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah You know, yeah makes sense and all
these like 30 plus or whatever and I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: even think like when when THC testing
started there was almost no 30 plus Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: no because there wasn't any there wasn't
any testing selection that allowed people
[SPEAKER_03]: To see higher numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll select those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and obviously without those numbers
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one selected those They weren't as good
Yeah, I mean, but how would you really
[SPEAKER_00]: tell a lot of the stuff that would get you
the most I would be the you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 percenters to 18 percenters Yeah,
or like, you know a lot a lot of it You
[SPEAKER_03]: know the sour diesel and the chems a lot
of those things are like in the low to mid
[SPEAKER_03]: 20s Yeah, you know really good chem dog
can be as low as 17.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be 17 to 22 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know Knocks my head off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but it's only it's not that high,
you know, so you need a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: it But like nobody had any idea what any
TH percentage I mean when was THC
[SPEAKER_03]: percentage even a thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not until like oh eight or nine
two thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my collectives are getting popular I
remember even past that it took a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time before collective started posting THC
percentages on the regular Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think I was smoking for 20 plus
years before there was any Verified
[SPEAKER_03]: ability to get weed tested for percentages
that you could access.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah It just didn't exist like weed was
good because it smelled good and it worked
[SPEAKER_00]: good and you and you wanted it Yeah,
I actually can remember pretty well when
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitch from the Adam Dunn show back when he
was one of the main hosts on that show He
[SPEAKER_00]: brought on a bunch of the testing labs and
it just started popping up and we were
[SPEAKER_00]: just beginning to understand what a THC
standard was why there was no consistency
[SPEAKER_00]: Between two different labs all that stuff
and I remember he brought them on iron
[SPEAKER_00]: labs, Michigan SC labs and a few others
and they ended up all slowly Hanging up on
[SPEAKER_00]: the fucking podcast and the calls because
the questions got too fucking complicated
[SPEAKER_00]: and they didn't want to answer that shit
So yeah, it was it was later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely was later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Yeah, so what that meant was that for
a long time almost all breeding selection
[SPEAKER_03]: was done based on Your ability to you know
to look yeah, you know, how does it grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: How does it yield?
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it look like?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what does it smell like?
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it burn like?
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it smoke like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and now I think part of the modern
problem with science is you've got people
[SPEAKER_03]: that like Think that they can grow by
numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and they're just looking at charts
and they're looking for higher THC and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're looking for certain high terpenes
and they're looking for this and that and
[SPEAKER_03]: the selection of like I mean this sounds
really bro, but like the selection of like
[SPEAKER_03]: six or seven friends smoking a bunch of
joints and saying what they think Yeah is
[SPEAKER_03]: often more effective than any kind of
chart so far Yeah, because at the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: the day it's all about whether or not
humans like to consume it The end of the
[SPEAKER_03]: day robots don't smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck the man Yeah, well, it's like it's
this weird thing too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like, I'm not a musician Matt is but
there's an aspect in like musical
[SPEAKER_03]: reproduction where like some level of
Distortion and some harmonics are better
[SPEAKER_03]: than others.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm But did he freeze he froze up froze
up on a smile Maybe he's getting a phone
[SPEAKER_00]: call.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I froze up who knows I guess we'll
see
[SPEAKER_00]: Not back not back yet Yeah, I also had oh
he left so he must have got the phone call
[SPEAKER_00]: or booted or something Anyways,
I have also had on here One of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites all reversal sprays colloidal
silver I get that non-stop all the time no
[SPEAKER_00]: matter how many times I put Post my spray
someone would chime in and be like
[SPEAKER_00]: colloidal silver It's just fucking
colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one asked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody you know, it's an assumption But
yeah, that's one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I I remember aspirin For reversals
was another favorite of mine that people
[SPEAKER_00]: would use aspirins for the reversals But
I'm shocked people don't actually say that
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore and mostly I just hear colloidal
silver and that's that's what does it all
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what does it all I'm back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where'd you go?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know did all of a sudden you had
this weird look on your face And I
[SPEAKER_03]: realized you were frozen and then I was
gone and it said basically thanks for
[SPEAKER_03]: playing Yeah, I got an ID message and I
was gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't you know It didn't like me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kicked me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was about to drop some secrets and
the Illuminati stepped in and was like no
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna change the subject fucking
never gonna work never gonna work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Someone did talk about also in the
comments that I thought was funny And a
[SPEAKER_00]: good one was harvest in the dark hang your
plants upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the THC flows to the top of the colas
That is that is that is some bro science
[SPEAKER_03]: it is Strangely enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: You definitely want to hang your plant
upside down, but for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah But yeah, there was there is some
weird stuff that I don't know if it's true
[SPEAKER_03]: or not where people talk about harvesting
in the nighttime Harvest having certain
[SPEAKER_03]: amounts of dark cycles because they want
the resin To be in a certain state when
[SPEAKER_03]: they harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know the only thing THC was
supposedly Supposedly THC is strongest in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant at in during the dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the old claim I don't know if
that's true or not, but I I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some scientific stuff that says
yeah, actually, you know harvesting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dark is is when it is, you know,
whatever that one I don't know the answer
[SPEAKER_03]: to there's a lot of this stuff that's
gonna get proven or disproven over time
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know and some of it like some of
it like how good is weed or like what does
[SPEAKER_03]: the testing do for us?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna have to interpret that how
well we think it's working ourselves Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's obviously like not just raw
numbers When it's a consumable that
[SPEAKER_03]: produces an effect on humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like at the end of the day,
that's what's important Yeah, that's all
[SPEAKER_03]: we care about right is like how that that
effect of once we consume it However,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're consuming it, you know,
and that you can't I don't know that we
[SPEAKER_03]: understand numbers that lead to specifics
Yeah, I don't know like we don't even know
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't know why what's interesting is
you look at and that's one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_03]: why The THC numbers is so bunk is because
I think there's like a big like
[SPEAKER_03]: misunderstanding about THC percentage and
people view it like it's alcohol Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're like stronger is better.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's yeah, you look fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but for me, it's more like You know
since there's so many kinds of highs Like
[SPEAKER_03]: what's the math?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the math?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the testing that shows you this is
gonna be a racy buds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's gonna make you want to crawl
out of your skin Yeah, this one's gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: make you uncomfortable This one's gonna
make you alcohol kind of has the same
[SPEAKER_03]: effects all the way up depending on your
tolerance Yeah, but weed does wildly
[SPEAKER_00]: different shit Yeah to everyone depending
on time of the day where you're smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: type of strain Everything everything
changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah people someone just said isn't
science proof Science is proof.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like what's not proof is that THC by
itself detonates how?
[SPEAKER_00]: strong a strain is Yeah, this isn't a
quantifiable science yet high Experience
[SPEAKER_00]: is not quantifiable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So technically right now science can only
take it so far I mean, it's it's a number
[SPEAKER_03]: and humans like numbers and they like
playing With numbers and it's the one that
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody recognizes Yeah, but there's
actually a pretty big movement to get away
[SPEAKER_03]: from THC numbers at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it would be nice But I think that
would take so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're still we're still calling
stuff like I mean people are still saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know All fucking sativas do this all
hybrids do this all indicas do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like we're still at that stage
so long time I'm gonna remember this one
[SPEAKER_03]: because this dude just said flushing is a
myth and that's probably actually
[SPEAKER_03]: something cool to chat about but yeah,
one of the things that we haven't talked
[SPEAKER_03]: about there was a super bro myth is the is
You know, you can tell indica versus
[SPEAKER_03]: sativa versus broadleaf versus thinly Yes,
and when you see extreme broadleaf,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's how you know, it's more indica and
when you see thin leaves That's what how
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's some sativa in there and
that there's also a high Associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: each if you see those big broad leaves,
you know, it's gonna make you go like
[SPEAKER_00]: relax See those thinly, you know,
it's gonna make you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo y'all excited Yeah, and so that was
that's super strong and the whole the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole indica sativa thing is actually like
It's actually outdated now Because it was
[SPEAKER_03]: like it was misclassified to begin with I
just think it's so Used currently.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see us like changing it anytime
soon No, unfortunately not as much as
[SPEAKER_03]: people are gonna push and try it's gonna
Take a long time to pick because according
[SPEAKER_03]: to like raw science right now What we
would consider sativa they would call
[SPEAKER_03]: indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes from India Yeah, and what we call
indica they would call afghanica From
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghanistan and Pakistan region they would
call it afghanica, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what we would call what you know,
like and then what we would call
[SPEAKER_03]: ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They call sativa I Think you got that
little twist It up, but I know what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I have it twisted up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a little bit twisted up Where did
I twist it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's it twisted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see the sativa would be What is
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the Sativa was hemp indica was all
Afghans afghanica was its own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was short stout structured Afghanis
The ruderalis one that doesn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: change Yeah, something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd have to look it up because Matt and I
disagree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we know it's sweets and dreams,
but most important But what we can what we
[SPEAKER_03]: can definitely say is that it changed
Classification wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah from 30 40 years ago to now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah But that classification change has
not gotten into our common speech Yes,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so we basically as weed people call
like indica is anything that's like that's
[SPEAKER_03]: from Afghanistan Pakistan whatever region
and Sativas are various mostly equatorial
[SPEAKER_03]: things from around the globe yeah,
and that's and that's it and and but
[SPEAKER_03]: that's not how they you know, and so like
we were talking about it just the other
[SPEAKER_03]: day where a lot of the highland Afghans Or
cushions from you can do Kush are a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: more thinly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah You know where the like the Bubba
type stuff the more low-lying Afghans from
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like low elevation or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are a lot more widely Yeah You know,
it's because what is it has something to
[SPEAKER_00]: do with the The barometric pressure this
the the how the leaves transpire leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration and There's that last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean that's related to how the leaves
transpire But there yes, so when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: when you're in a colder drier More UV
environment like a like a Mountain
[SPEAKER_03]: Highland Valley Yeah, you want to have
thinner leaves because you don't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: transpire too much from your pores Yeah,
and you get all the light you need because
[SPEAKER_03]: you're higher up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the atmosphere is thinner.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get more light Yeah, and you don't
need as much you don't need as big a fan
[SPEAKER_03]: leaves to catch it Yeah, you know where
it's your if you're in a humid spot or a
[SPEAKER_03]: lowland spot you could have wider leaves
because You know, so but that that's
[SPEAKER_03]: there's some broscience there where We
maybe haven't gotten all that figured out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but there's definitely pure Afghans
that have some fairly thin leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and They're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's pure Pakistanis or near pure
Pakistanis that are pure turpentine,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is something you usually see from
Hays types, you know Yeah, and they would
[SPEAKER_03]: say that and and so that used to be I mean
that was the way like if you crossed an
[SPEAKER_03]: Indica to a sativa back in the day You
would look at all the wide types and be
[SPEAKER_03]: like all these Lean Afghan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and every thin type you'd be like,
oh that's an extreme sativa and you might
[SPEAKER_03]: even judge how extreme based on how tall
it was and how thin the leaves were and
[SPEAKER_03]: Thinking you are 100% right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah When in reality, there's lanky
indicates Yeah, I remember my first
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with that was a Lebanese that
I've got from a collective and I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, it was called Lebanese Kush and It
had very narrow leaves it grew one big
[SPEAKER_00]: Long cola, but it finished in seven weeks,
you know But it was it was very red and it
[SPEAKER_00]: had a very Narcotic effect at the same
time and I was very confused how this this
[SPEAKER_00]: narrow leaf thing could possibly be a push
or you know, I mean like yeah Considered
[SPEAKER_00]: an Indica of any any sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting too because you think
about the environment of like You know
[SPEAKER_03]: like they in Afghanistan As a way wider
range of elevation then yeah anywhere that
[SPEAKER_03]: people grow here All the way from
basically sea level up to like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, seven eight thousand feet Yeah,
you know and they have a the Hindu Kush
[SPEAKER_03]: mountain range is the second biggest
mountain range next to the Himalayas Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: so that's seven eight thousand feet or six
thousand feet or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still mountain valleys Yeah,
and there's still peaks that doesn't have
[SPEAKER_03]: anything on it that go way up above that
And so obviously the environment there is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Someone's asking about Asian wide
leaf varieties I know there was a Chinese
[SPEAKER_00]: this variety or a camera was called the I
know ace carried a Chinese Union for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while I I haven't seen him but I have
heard that there are broadly Chinese
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and that's supposedly where a lot
of those came from so perhaps Perhaps I
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't experienced them yet though myself
Someone just asked if do potatoes grow
[SPEAKER_03]: underground The potato that you eat does
grow underground but that is a big
[SPEAKER_00]: above-ground component Yeah, no,
we I pick mine off trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna kind of fucking potatoes you're
eating But I mean technically,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know all broad leaf Most broad leaf is
Asian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes because Afghanistan Pakistan that area
of China all Turkmenistan all that that's
[SPEAKER_03]: All Asia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the heart of Asia really
Yeah, I think they're afraid to Asia
[SPEAKER_03]: proper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, you know, but I mean it's definitely
on the Asian continent Yeah, I'm someone
[SPEAKER_00]: asked about ABC the Australian bastard
cannabis friendly flucking stuff now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: classified oddly enough and this is this
is from CSI not from my experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: but It is what most people would consider
a long flowering, you know narrow leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: type plant as opposed to What I mean it
looks short and squat and you know real
[SPEAKER_00]: compact bushy But it actually is a long
flowering, you know super to paneling type
[SPEAKER_00]: plant So probably people most people would
classify that as sativa or some type like
[SPEAKER_03]: that Yeah, but it it You know as science
starts to study this stuff it starts to
[SPEAKER_03]: study this stuff We're gonna learn a lot
more about like how the science impacts
[SPEAKER_03]: what's important to us Yeah, like Matt and
I danced around that so and maybe I'm bad
[SPEAKER_03]: for bringing it up because we were gonna
do a whole show on it at some point but
[SPEAKER_03]: certainly the difference between not
understanding genetics And not
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding real science had a massive
impact when certain companies started
[SPEAKER_03]: offering genetic testing and Promises
based on genetic testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know and promising that they
could reveal familial relationships and
[SPEAKER_03]: They could sort of unlock this like oral
history Yes, provide like a factual web of
[SPEAKER_03]: interrelated and interconnectedness Yeah,
and they got people to pay them and send
[SPEAKER_03]: them tons of DNA for it Yeah, they did and
it's essentially and you know and it ends
[SPEAKER_03]: up being That mostly mostly what everybody
paid for and risked their genetics to send
[SPEAKER_00]: in was never on the table anyway Yeah,
it was not It was totally inconsistent
[SPEAKER_00]: data as far as that goes Allegedly like
you know for it to use humans for
[SPEAKER_03]: instance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah genetics can be like this is 100%
These are my children.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's your grandpa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's your mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can prove it and That's kind of what we
were looking For with weed like this is
[SPEAKER_03]: your first cousin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah 100% 23 and me for cannabis,
you know, that's your great-grandpa.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your great-grandmother That's your
mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know and We didn't understand
enough of the science To really like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know They came out and they made a
bunch of claims and everybody sent them a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of genetics and a bunch of money And
at the end of the day no one got what they
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they did Yeah, you know
Unfortunately, we as humans we tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about plants like humans and we know
that we can do You know genetic relational
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can find someone based on their cousin
now You know like people are being put in
[SPEAKER_00]: prison based on this kind of data or
tracked down old serial killers But plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially cannabis are much more
complex creatures with expressions based
[SPEAKER_00]: on environment things like this It's a lot
different and and there's they needed a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more I guess what you'd say is they
needed Longer read system than they had
[SPEAKER_00]: they had a short read system and it just
wasn't Accurate enough to portray the data
[SPEAKER_00]: they were trying to say and and to me I
think it goes back to the bro science of
[SPEAKER_00]: well, they had these these different
categories like hemp like Blueberry I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know blueberry was hemp if I
remember correctly they had hemp they had
[SPEAKER_00]: like og cush They had these different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah skunk, but they didn't quite say what
defined these things into these
[SPEAKER_00]: categories, but they were Organized by
these categories and people still
[SPEAKER_00]: reference those as like well It shows mine
is obviously more og cushion skunk than
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, etc Etc because they were that's
why I said 23 and me and compared it to
[SPEAKER_03]: humans because when you talk genetics for
plants like You know, we don't understand
[SPEAKER_03]: very much So it's like you try to relate
it to the next thing that you understand
[SPEAKER_03]: some of exactly and we're like,
oh I want to I want to see if chem 91 is
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, is it you know, is it sour
diesels grandmother?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we think is this related to this are
they are the are the chems all sisters?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they this are they like you want all
that stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know and You know it We didn't
get it Yeah, you know and I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: that and you'd almost probably have to
take somebody who was an expert in that
[SPEAKER_03]: relative field Yes, who had our back?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and our interests at heart to tell
us Whether or not the mythology the the
[SPEAKER_03]: methods that they're using and what they
would need to give us the answers We're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for what it ended up taking was
someone that Was super precise with their
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog that probably has more history and
knowledge with their own catalog that is
[SPEAKER_00]: more resourceful and sourcing and more
anal about sourcing to then supply parent
[SPEAKER_00]: child grandchildren and then backwards
test it and see if they were able to Meet
[SPEAKER_00]: up that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah spending a lot of money together I
didn't even bring up the fact that like
[SPEAKER_03]: you get multiple different cuts that come
in all with the same name Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just more talking about like the bro
science of like we have all these stories
[SPEAKER_03]: of how things are related Yeah,
right like for instance, you know like the
[SPEAKER_03]: Suppose like the old Betsy and the bull
rider from down there in your neck of the
[SPEAKER_03]: woods are supposedly sisters Yeah,
right Yes, we don't have proof.
[SPEAKER_03]: No Just stories the stories yeah,
you know, so like we have all these
[SPEAKER_03]: stories and so Basically, it's like it's
like we're gonna have this like huge
[SPEAKER_03]: industry Where you don't have decades of
science behind organizing all this shit
[SPEAKER_03]: the way you would any other big value crop
Yeah It's all coming out of the woodwork
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's a huge fucking mess and there's a
bunch of liars and a bunch of hucksters
[SPEAKER_03]: and a bunch of deceitful ass fools trying
to lay claim to Old seeds and it's like so
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody gets took on some seven early 70s
Colombian gold Yeah pure from my uncle or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, and then that and that gets entered
into something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you even know what's real to
start your basis point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's that's like when I first
talked to Phyllis and I talked to him I
[SPEAKER_00]: told him and I said you you need you need
to consult with someone and much better
[SPEAKER_00]: than even myself who has a better
collection and understands Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: provenance better than anyone else in the
scene if you do not hire them and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: them on staff There is no point even doing
this because you have to start with good
[SPEAKER_00]: base Genetics to be able to develop this
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a reliable source for
skunk one reliable source for Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: light spy a reliable source for haze you
have to have all that reliable source for
[SPEAKER_00]: SFEOG all the different og cuts and
without all that reliable source
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else is bullshit because you
can't crowdsource Cannabis because most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the time the the most faint cut rises to
the top Yeah, I mean certainly they would
[SPEAKER_03]: have a heart and they they wouldn't be
able to tell anyway So they would have
[SPEAKER_03]: this thing where it would be like well
these five cuts of Chem D Say that this
[SPEAKER_03]: but then there's these other weird ones
that got sent in say that Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and how would how would someone know?
[SPEAKER_00]: They would have to hire someone and that's
what they were all too lazy to do They
[SPEAKER_00]: were too cheap and too lazy and until the
company actually does that they're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get nowhere and every company That tries
it is going to spin their fucking wheels
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's how cannabis is as a bro I
don't know enough about Cannabis and plant
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics to know what the framework would
be to even get what we're after Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no clue.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what that would be at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm not qualified You know what I'm
saying to like judge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have to we would have to find
somebody that was into that That knew
[SPEAKER_03]: enough that wasn't gonna bullshit us They
could look at their methods and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: this and they're that and figure out,
you know Because I would assume like with
[SPEAKER_03]: humans they figured out what the Swedish
gene pool was like by testing a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: Swedes Yeah, yeah, you know and they were
able to go around the different human
[SPEAKER_03]: populations and they got enough data that
they were able to see differences Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I don't know because I'm not a
geneticist I think I think because the
[SPEAKER_00]: human genome was so thoroughly mapped and
I don't believe the cannabis genome was
[SPEAKER_00]: thoroughly mapped yet or Maybe it's just
too expensive to run these type of tests
[SPEAKER_00]: at the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be that So, you know,
there's an aspect where it's like we have
[SPEAKER_03]: all these oral tales about how things are
related Yeah, and we have no way of
[SPEAKER_03]: discerning if they're actually true And
every time it's been promised so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been cheating Yeah Yeah, you know,
it's it's it's been very upsetting and
[SPEAKER_00]: disappointing all of the above and I think
I think what most people don't know is it
[SPEAKER_00]: like Philos did shut down their genetic
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are no longer taking in tests
supposedly to do genetic testing Currently
[SPEAKER_00]: the database if I'm correct is still up so
if anybody feels the need back it up
[SPEAKER_00]: because it may not always be up and Some
of these people who you know paid for
[SPEAKER_03]: these tests might want that data someday
and what's risky about it is I was just
[SPEAKER_03]: having a different convo, but you know
like now that we're getting into Science
[SPEAKER_03]: and now that we're getting into legal
stuff A lot of the science behind it and a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of this testing and a lot of this
other stuff people are nervous because
[SPEAKER_03]: they're worried that it could be used to
You know lock access to stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like you get the genetic code for
something and you lay claim to it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know or you use it or you know,
like Philos had a whole like, you know
[SPEAKER_03]: backhand aspect of what they were trying
to do Yeah, and so a lot of science,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know science isn't just sitting there
waiting or it's you know Science is done
[SPEAKER_03]: by humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and those humans can have like a
variety of goals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so So like for weed nerds,
you're all just trying to get some like
[SPEAKER_03]: raw science to like answer questions and
figure out stuff You want to know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, so one thing Bro science
that's going on right now that Matt can
[SPEAKER_03]: speak of extensively.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Most reversal stuff is very bro Yes in the
sense that there's not hard data on what
[SPEAKER_03]: to do and You know Matt and Caleb and
other friends that do that shit with
[SPEAKER_03]: really extensively there's certain strains
where it's it's very likely that a certain
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of of Spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah is very effective and too much or too
little is not yeah, and it can vary by
[SPEAKER_00]: strain it can vary by Clone of strain if
you could have two clones one inch from
[SPEAKER_00]: each other and give completely different
reactions to the same Exact amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: spray it is it the data is so incomplete
and I think the most data is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: between You know guys like me and Caleb or
whoever else talking and putting together
[SPEAKER_00]: our notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you seen?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the what was the PPMs of the
spray?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of spray were using?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the you know, what was the
constituents of the spray?
[SPEAKER_00]: How often were you spraying was it a
trigger?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you you know there's all kinds of
things that go into it and and as of right
[SPEAKER_00]: now because Controls are never gonna be
that good until you have a you know
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-million dollar facility Until that's
going on and the trials are being done in
[SPEAKER_00]: places like that I think we're gonna be
keep spinning our wheels So yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: so the majority of the of the seed market
right now is feminized At least the
[SPEAKER_03]: American one and it's very bro science and
that it's observational stuff passed
[SPEAKER_03]: amongst friends Yeah, or maybe some
tutorials that you can read on what to mix
[SPEAKER_03]: and what to use and so on and so forth
Yeah, but there's a there's obviously like
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's even Stuff that you know,
Caleb or Matt has shared with me where
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like here's this plant doesn't matter
which one But here's a plant and I've
[SPEAKER_03]: sprayed four different types of reversal
mix on it Yeah, and this one is the only
[SPEAKER_03]: one that worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right the other all the others
failed But then you use that same spray on
[SPEAKER_03]: on some other strains and it doesn't work
nearly as well as the ones that failed on
[SPEAKER_03]: the that plant Yeah So there's like a big
there's probably in my opinion There's
[SPEAKER_03]: like a vast amount of knowledge to figure
that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the one thing that we were finding
that's holding true is that each different
[SPEAKER_00]: type of spray is as Inconsistent as the
other meaning some that are let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: someone uses colloidal silver someone uses
silver thiosulfate someone uses Cobalt
[SPEAKER_00]: chloride each one is gonna be like the
cobalt chloride stuff might be better with
[SPEAKER_00]: like Tk, you know, but it's not always
gonna be that consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not always gonna be effective and
each one each different type of spray is
[SPEAKER_00]: just as Inconsistent as the next because
there's so many different expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really really fucking hard to explain
and You just can't quantify yet We cannot
[SPEAKER_03]: quantify it yet because for the most part
with some rare exceptions in normal
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding you can have a few males and You
can get an incredibly dense amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: pollen and seeds, but you know off off of
a off of You know a project making regular
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds as a vacation making regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't really need that many males
depending on how big it is and Getting of
[SPEAKER_03]: getting a vigorous and thorough
pollination with with a few simple tricks
[SPEAKER_03]: is quite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes Yeah, literally reversals are like
going into the casino with a bunch of tips
[SPEAKER_03]: and ideas on how to beat the house and
you're hoping That you come out ahead that
[SPEAKER_00]: time and every time the the best advice I
give everyone is numbers the more numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: you have the more of a chance you have of
being successful that round and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't afford to lose then I you know keep
a lot of male plants clones of that or
[SPEAKER_00]: keep a lot of clones of the same plant
reversing do several if you can't afford
[SPEAKER_03]: to Miss so yeah, I mean there's there's
not that that that whole area is ripe for
[SPEAKER_03]: a bunch of And a problem is is there's no
there's no direct money in it right now
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that kind of experimentation to go
on to really open unlock that side of it
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just interested breeders sharing
knowledge and guessing Yeah, and every
[SPEAKER_03]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing you should realize about
all these when you ever you buy feminine
[SPEAKER_03]: seed You know I always talk about how like
you know breeding is a lot of failure and
[SPEAKER_03]: mostly what I mean is That it doesn't give
you the results in the children that you
[SPEAKER_03]: were hoping for yes the time That's mostly
what I mean, but what it's also true is
[SPEAKER_03]: that there's a lot of failure in Reversals
it's it's expensive total failure You know
[SPEAKER_03]: very very light pollination You know all
that and and so you know in addition to
[SPEAKER_03]: the failure of just normal breeding
There's you know the failure to make seed
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah the and the main thing Problem like
for people that are wondering what the
[SPEAKER_00]: issue is when we say a failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: almost every time event When I did the the
13,000 plant reversal I saw three plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and 13,000 that didn't reverse at all They
had no male parts that stayed all female
[SPEAKER_00]: and didn't take any kind of hormonal
treatment That's three and 13,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so rare to even be able to observe
that Most of the time what you'll see is a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant a female or a female plant you're
reversing we'll start To form male parts
[SPEAKER_00]: after about three and a half four weeks
But the parts will instead of like on most
[SPEAKER_00]: males will the ball balls will hang as
they mature on on a female plant when you
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse it the balls cluster hard as if
they were a female bud and Whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: happens in this action is where it doesn't
allow the the male parts to mature it just
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't allow them to mature because it's
they're all clustered so hard and We don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what exactly causes That clustering
there's a few tips and tricks like where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use jubrelic acid spray it really
lightly and hope that you know if the the
[SPEAKER_00]: anthers and everything expand a little bit
and cause a little bit Give it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more room to mature But yeah,
that's that's the main action most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time you'll see balls not all the times
Will the balls open and drop or mature?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, cuz there's like there's an open
drop on a male and then all this pollen
[SPEAKER_03]: comes out But it's like if they're all
stacked Every which way tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, then they can't then they don't open
and so sometimes there's pollen in there
[SPEAKER_03]: and our friends have had success Manually
removing that pollen get tweezers you pull
[SPEAKER_00]: it out and you shake it out in a little
bag one by one and that's That we consider
[SPEAKER_03]: that a failure if you have to do that,
you know Right or using using various
[SPEAKER_03]: kinds of mesh or screens or different
things and trying to get the pollen
[SPEAKER_03]: Separated from the rest of the flower
because you don't want to fail even more
[SPEAKER_03]: than you've already thought Failed exactly
you're trying to get at least even if it's
[SPEAKER_03]: not a sellable amount of seed you're like
Well, I at least want some that I can like
[SPEAKER_03]: run Yes and test and give to my friends
and see what's in it because I mean I want
[SPEAKER_03]: to see what's in it Yeah, you know,
but there's a lot of manual pollination
[SPEAKER_03]: that goes on with with reversal simply
because it's all bro science Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I mean I Matt can speak to this more
than I can but I mean when reversals first
[SPEAKER_03]: started happening When was the first time
that like a tutorial?
[SPEAKER_03]: Got posted on one of the forums because it
was pretty tightly held information for a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute I can't remember the dudes name and
I really wish I did because he deserves
[SPEAKER_00]: credit but the dude I know Fett later
posted it on from Spice Brothers posted on
[SPEAKER_00]: over grow and it was a Basic tutorial on
how to make spray that will be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the two point five or point five
two point five I think it was combo of
[SPEAKER_00]: silver nitrate and sodium thiosulfate
Mixed it, you know 500 milliliters a piece
[SPEAKER_00]: you mix it in then nine to one on On the
the ratio dilution rate and that became
[SPEAKER_00]: where most people started and you know
Some people took it further from there and
[SPEAKER_00]: worked more on the ratio to perfect it for
certain types of strains and strains are
[SPEAKER_00]: more popular now and Some people stuck
with that and still use that to this day
[SPEAKER_00]: and and have effective success Yeah,
I mean we Had we have some friends that
[SPEAKER_03]: have some funny stories that like fucked
up the dilution ratios early on and
[SPEAKER_03]: sprayed like way too strong of a solution
and Like half killed the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, but then it reversed really well
Yeah, you know a bunch of leaves died
[SPEAKER_03]: looked all haggard and heinous and all
that, you know so I mean there's a there's
[SPEAKER_03]: an aspect and then it's there's this thing
too where like the scientific method is
[SPEAKER_03]: like you do an experiment and Then you get
results And then other people are able to
[SPEAKER_03]: replicate that Over and over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if enough people do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well now you've got some accepted science,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the problem with s the problem with
reversals is someone does something they
[SPEAKER_03]: write it all down they document just
exactly how they did it and Then somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: else does that same thing with the same
plants and they fail or it doesn't go very
[SPEAKER_03]: well Yeah, and so the replication part we
haven't even gotten to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how you do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah These are the these are the factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the things you take into account
to dial it in Yeah, it's hoping and
[SPEAKER_03]: guesswork Yeah, you know and Matt would
even do a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would tell me that sometimes He would
reverse three or four different strains
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I always have backups of backups of
backup because he he wanted, you know He
[SPEAKER_03]: was interested in breeding with all of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and whichever one reversed the best
Yeah was gonna be the males that was used
[SPEAKER_03]: and that that obliterated some failure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah You know cuz you're trying to
mitigate failure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah You know and that's and I don't know
that but that that that like observational
[SPEAKER_03]: bro science isn't changing anytime soon
because I don't know when like corporate
[SPEAKER_03]: paid-for science is going to get to
Looking at reversals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah doing a bunch of Nonprofitable work
to figure out how it works and to leave
[SPEAKER_03]: the info open source after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not very likely Yeah,
and and not just sit on that proprietary
[SPEAKER_03]: style Yeah, because they figured it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know and so how so that that
aspect of things So there's all this stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: where like real science could help us But
how do we as grungy weed people access it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know something going on right now
Maybe we could talk about that too where
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like I mean, I wasn't worried about
disease at all in the 90s Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know and now viroids and dudding and
pathogens Have become a massive issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and by the time we had testing forum
They were everywhere Right now right like
[SPEAKER_03]: I got people texting me all the time about
viroids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's all kinds of post It's in
all kinds of you know It's like it's gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: get to a point probably in the legal
market where when you buy clones They're
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna have to have viroid free tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean I just heard that some Little
raton brought a bunch of clones over to
[SPEAKER_00]: Barcelona and ruined a bunch of Libraries
serious libraries that were keeping old
[SPEAKER_00]: strains at European strains because You
know people people over there trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: import our shitty gelato with fucking HPLV
and that's what happens Yeah, I mean I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: to the point now I buy one of those like
hundred pack of razors Yeah, and if I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: taking cuttings or something, it's a new
it's a new razor every plant Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I take a lot more precautions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to just use a razor until it got
dull Yeah, take two three hundred cuttings
[SPEAKER_03]: with it and then it stopped cutting quite
as well and pop a new one This this goes
[SPEAKER_00]: back to what we were talking about the
breast science someone just asked if
[SPEAKER_00]: reversals were normal Back in the day when
I would you know debate people about it I
[SPEAKER_00]: would point out really quickly that
actually we we as humans have tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed out the intersex trait and the
intersex trait is actually standard in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, so Technically reversals are
bringing it back to where it was and more
[SPEAKER_00]: natural Than what we have done by humans
breeding intersex traits out of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, because I mean that was the big
thing was like people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're doing something so unnatural to
the plant Yeah, you're ruining it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're ruining it because it's unnatural
and I would always point out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually We're moving it back to more
natural and intersects.
[SPEAKER_03]: We touched on that with like the the
Hermes you start with Hermes seeds You're
[SPEAKER_03]: ruining the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but there was a lot of prejudice
because People thought that they you were
[SPEAKER_03]: permanently altering the cannabis cheat
the genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes by doing this cheating thing Yeah,
and I've mentioned it before on previous
[SPEAKER_03]: podcasts, but up until the late 80s early
90s Seatless weed really wasn't very
[SPEAKER_03]: popular So all we was seeded.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, so if a plant had a bunch
of hermaphrodites Oh, well, there was a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of males anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah You know all that tie all that this
all that hashtag They didn't care as much
[SPEAKER_03]: if it got you know, like it there was just
Hermes weren't that big of a deal a few
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds here and there Yeah, they were just
gonna beat the fuck out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, they're gonna beat the fuck out of
it Anyway, they're gonna turn it into hash
[SPEAKER_03]: and then all the smoking cultures the
Colombian the Panamanian the Jamaican and
[SPEAKER_03]: all that most of that came chock full of
seeds the Mexican Yeah, so a few more
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds from Hermes.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it any different?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was it was when we started trying
to grow seedless That we were like,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, there's this built-in Trait to
cannabis that we don't like what the fuck
[SPEAKER_03]: is it doing here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, why is a breeder?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you allow this to exist and threaten my
room of pure, you know Because it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: the most unnatural thing in the world is
what we do to cannabis Yes, if we grow it
[SPEAKER_00]: for flour, yeah, we're denying it what it
wants to do I Forgot this I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed you this is the LA Chris
triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, it looks like it's got some
triangle density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's very Strong, but it actually
smells exactly like fucking sour Sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got sidetracked people So you do
get regular males on reversals somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: technically Yes, but I don't think they
test male like if you were to sex test and
[SPEAKER_00]: they would sex test female They are just
expressing male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I only don't understand the difference
between expressing and Genotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay so I did like a 13,000 seed pop of
CSI work, which you're familiar with
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and out of that we probably got of
that 13,000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We probably got about I Don't know 80 to
100 Observational full males.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no female flowers Full pollen not
her map or did not her map or diets where
[SPEAKER_03]: they had both Yeah, but for them but for
the most part full balls full everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah You know And so, you know,
that's obviously not that many out of out
[SPEAKER_03]: of that many seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah But you know, we're we're playing a
little dr. Frankenstein with with plants
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's like they just want to you
know, they're not there they're Their
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding isn't to provide us with what we
want Yeah, they're trying to make seed for
[SPEAKER_00]: the next generation and do their thing and
Someone said no, they would not test male.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would test female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's observationally what we've
seen so far Anyways, yeah, I mean we know
[SPEAKER_03]: that so, you know a certain percentage and
then you know It's not so much the to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not so much the method you use It's
more that does the plant have it in its
[SPEAKER_03]: genes or not?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Because one of the reasons why for
instance you guys don't see a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: diesel s1s on the market is Because diesel
is famously hard to reverse Yes,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's some things with audits.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some things that harm but almost
never will success Reverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and there's some things that reverse
like a champ Yeah, you know and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: some things that reliably reverse nine
times out of ten and then one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: times it won't drop any pollen and you'll
fucking smash your balls in a drawer that
[SPEAKER_03]: 13,000 seed hunt was in Southern,
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean we did we did a 13,000 plant
reversal and made a few million seeds but
[SPEAKER_00]: like hunting 13,000 seeds isn't that
common no It's nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a luxury for someone to be able to do
It was one of the I was I was helping on
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the bigger farms in Southern,
California at the time But there is there
[SPEAKER_03]: is an explosion now of 80 acre 40 acre 25
acres You know this that everything else
[SPEAKER_03]: those 13,000 plants they took up about
seven acres But there's also the factor
[SPEAKER_00]: and I you know, I saw this with the the
seed pop at the at the hemp place and
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere else Testing is a bitch when
you do 13,000 plants because someone's got
[SPEAKER_00]: a smoke at all if you're gonna do a pheno
hunt It was too many.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was too many It wasn't it wasn't
there was a lot of non-ideal things about
[SPEAKER_03]: that particular project for sure But
people get excited and money does what
[SPEAKER_03]: money wants to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah And so yeah, I mean even even even
growing out three or four hundred plants
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and trying to objectively test the
smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah It's it's it's uh, it's rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah You know at some point you're you're
gonna you're gonna start missing things
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, or you know as as as Caleb likes to
say just look for the runtiest shittiest
[SPEAKER_03]: Most nastiest production plant you've ever
seen and let your smokers try that one and
[SPEAKER_03]: that'll be the clear top five Yeah,
yeah the one that you're hoping doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: taste and smell and smoke like it actually
does Yeah, and then all the beastly
[SPEAKER_03]: production plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be like meh Okay, you know someone
just brought in something good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll jump on it Did you guys cover bro
science of male selection and I don't we
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't no not yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at all We haven't talked there's a
bunch of bro science with male selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes the number one thing that I am asked
as a seed maker is What do you look for in
[SPEAKER_00]: your males, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like and that's the assumption that I only
look for certain traits in males and if
[SPEAKER_00]: they have those traits then I use them
which is a thousand percent how I don't do
[SPEAKER_00]: things I usually start with a an idea an
end goal like I want a plant that's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be let's say strawberry and Have pretty
dense structure and kind of short and
[SPEAKER_00]: squat and from there I will think of
different lines where I can achieve that
[SPEAKER_00]: and Then select a male that has the traits
that I want and same with the female and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how each project is done and
achieved So different different male for
[SPEAKER_03]: different female for different purposes,
you know some bro science That I would
[SPEAKER_03]: classify that I don't know has been
scientifically proven Is if it showed
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers in veg you chuck it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah You know, sometimes people would even
torture like this is some bro science
[SPEAKER_03]: where you'd be like I'm gonna torture this
male Yeah, I'm gonna keep a cutting of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna grow it way too big in a solo
cup I'm gonna let it drought three or four
[SPEAKER_03]: times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna beat it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna do weird shit to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it stable?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah the Testing males aspect was was a
big popular thing people used to say on
[SPEAKER_00]: the forums I'm gonna I'm gonna stress test
my fucking males I'm gonna stress test
[SPEAKER_00]: these females and see what we can do to
them and to me I always I always had an
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite point of view on it and I'd be
like I Don't want people to grow my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they grow them like shit,
of course, they're gonna hurt So what's a
[SPEAKER_00]: point of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the stress testing males Well,
if you throw any male in a fucking tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: little cup, it's gonna fuck an auto flower
99% of the time, you know There's an
[SPEAKER_03]: aspect where the plant is desperate to do
what it's supposed to do which is make
[SPEAKER_03]: seed and produce provide the next
generation so you beat the shit out of it
[SPEAKER_03]: and You know, it's some of them might
panic and be like no matter what I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: do what I'm supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah There is actually it's interesting
one of the things we should we should and
[SPEAKER_03]: this is something that we might have a
friend on at some point I don't know but
[SPEAKER_03]: he goes by the handle on IG of 707 seed
bank Yeah, we call him Shahbud but he was
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the guys he would reverse males and
Smoke them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, because he wanted to see what the
resin production and what the turps were
[SPEAKER_00]: and what the smoke was like as a female
plant Yeah, I would do the same thing But
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't smoke them because there
usually wasn't enough smokable content to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it worth it But I get an idea for for
the terpene production of the male and
[SPEAKER_00]: that way when when I ran the progeny from
Said male I would be able to identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is coming from the mail and
that's why you know Yeah, so that was just
[SPEAKER_03]: another way of trying to get information
because I think Matt calls it the shotgun
[SPEAKER_03]: method Right where a lot of times you
don't really know you have some
[SPEAKER_03]: observational things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it tall?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it short?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it flower early?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it not does its flower clusters?
[SPEAKER_03]: Look look sexy Yeah, and then you use that
one and then you got to grow out seeds and
[SPEAKER_03]: be like did this pass the traits that I
want Yeah, and you know Neville and other
[SPEAKER_03]: guys That like grew up in the era of all
male female breeding You know finding the
[SPEAKER_03]: male was the biggest bitch Yeah,
finding the one that would consistently
[SPEAKER_03]: pass the traits that you want to the
progeny That was the whole game and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: still the biggest bitch in the game I
think even though reversals are
[SPEAKER_00]: technically harder because of the failure
rate I think that breeding wise it's much
[SPEAKER_00]: easily easier to select a female from
observable traits than it is A male
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing what observable traits he'll pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean we could use Neville as another
example just because it's super famous But
[SPEAKER_03]: you know when he went to jail in 1990 one
of his crew found this cut in NL five haze
[SPEAKER_03]: and skunk haze Yeah, and it was like a sea
of turpentine and cat piss and weird shit
[SPEAKER_03]: and they found this one amazing plant and
then When he when he started working at
[SPEAKER_03]: sensei they started breeding and that he
started Trying to find different skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: haze males that he would cross to his
favorite NL five haze females to get that
[SPEAKER_03]: line Yeah, and that's what Jack Herrera
came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but he still wasn't happy with it so
they worked on it for two or three more
[SPEAKER_03]: years with Shanti and that's what the
mango haze and the Neville's haze and the
[SPEAKER_03]: and the Super silver haze came from yeah,
and the whole time the the moms never
[SPEAKER_03]: changed The whole time consuming process
was was choosing four or five males And
[SPEAKER_03]: crossing it separately to each Female and
then growing out the progeny and seeing if
[SPEAKER_03]: the progeny was worth the shit and gave it
what it wanted If I remember correctly,
[SPEAKER_00]: he didn't even like breeding with female
hazes He thought that the magic to haze
[SPEAKER_03]: was in the males if I remember correctly
Yeah, he says that and I'm an admitted big
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but even I will say that two things
one is that The males are what he ended up
[SPEAKER_03]: with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah So it's good to say well this hey see
this was the clear winner This is the one
[SPEAKER_03]: we should have used and to only be using
males One of the things that's interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: is when you're growing out some 18 or 20
or 22 weeks of Teva thing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Collecting pollen and then pollinating a
room of much more skunk Indica females.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's a lot easier timing Than
timing pollen drop to use a female You
[SPEAKER_03]: know, so mature those 22 week long fucking
flowering seeds Yeah, they're mature those
[SPEAKER_03]: 22 week long flowering seeds contained
within the female and What it sounds like
[SPEAKER_03]: to me is that he had some amazing females
and he just lost them and didn't realize
[SPEAKER_03]: what he had until they were fucked Yeah,
perhaps, you know, there's a scene a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of pictures of original haze of Plants
where people are like this is the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: one of original Haze, this is the you
know, there was a lady named hazy lady and
[SPEAKER_00]: you might be able to find her picture
still on mr Nice She was one of the only
[SPEAKER_00]: people I saw they consistently grew the
positronix haze 19 Hill that consistently
[SPEAKER_00]: grew it beautifully and I can say it was a
beautiful haze grow but rarely rarely if
[SPEAKER_00]: ever Did I see beautiful haze females?
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, and I mean there's an aspect
there where it's like what it sounds like
[SPEAKER_03]: he even you know after four or five years
of having Hades Sounds like Neville ended
[SPEAKER_03]: up with literally one living plant That he
could work with in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Which was hazy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know sense for old seeds,
you know, you know and and but it sounds
[SPEAKER_03]: like if he knew what he had He probably
would have kept all of them alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah and been more careful I would buy so
by the time he realized how special it
[SPEAKER_03]: was.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'd fucked it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Somebody wants to talk about the 56
day headband I can talk about the 56 day
[SPEAKER_03]: so there's some aspects of it that I don't
like but the the story is as as generally
[SPEAKER_03]: as I can as I can say is that It was
called something else in Southern,
[SPEAKER_03]: California and it was from it was it was
from within that that Kush crew down in
[SPEAKER_03]: Southern, California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah in some aspect and that Kush cut and
those cush is it was worth a lot of money
[SPEAKER_03]: and there was a lot of shit going around
with it and Something happened with that
[SPEAKER_03]: cut where there was some violence right
and So somebody fled So Cal and came to
[SPEAKER_03]: the bay with that cut and They didn't want
to call it what it actually was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay So they were trying to figure
out because they wanted to grow it and
[SPEAKER_03]: sell it so they were trying to figure out
Like what can we do so we can grow and
[SPEAKER_03]: sell this cut but it's not gonna create
any more heat That's gonna follow us from
[SPEAKER_03]: down there because what happened down
there was hell a hell a sketch,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and so they decided You know They
decided to rename it headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah you know and We I don't know for sure
what it was called before Yeah You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's the nicest Kush type plant that I
know like of actual Kush, you know Or what
[SPEAKER_03]: we would consider a Kush type like the SFV
or the or anything like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like it's the most potent to me yeah,
and Sometime in the you know, oh four or
[SPEAKER_03]: five or something like that right around
there It slipped out in the bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that's how I got it And that's
how some other people that have it have it
[SPEAKER_03]: and we call it the 56 day There's a huge
debate about when to take it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: some people like to take it long like 10
11 weeks But a lot of people like to take
[SPEAKER_03]: it at eight or nine weeks and they feel
it's like the most potent then We're gives
[SPEAKER_03]: you the highest high and like the the
edginess and the raciness and all that
[SPEAKER_03]: different types of stuff So it's got some
mystery, you know, there's some name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously like I'm there's there's
the different names I know I think Duke
[SPEAKER_00]: would call it the rest stop Kush because
that's where he got it from there's the
[SPEAKER_03]: People call it the murder cut and stuff
like that, you know, some people tried to
[SPEAKER_03]: some people try to to push it as You know,
it's the original New York City headband,
[SPEAKER_03]: which we now know is totally false.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah But you know to me like when it comes
down to it, I would classify it as far as
[SPEAKER_03]: things I hold it's in the top three or
four potency wise Yeah, yeah, it's really
[SPEAKER_03]: really good weed and I usually pull it I
usually pull it between eight and nine
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah 60 days 59 days 63 days Something
along something along something along that
[SPEAKER_03]: that level, you know, it probably has
other names other places There's a few
[SPEAKER_03]: people out there that might know the the
the first name, you know, yeah But it is
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a really pure og cut That's the one
that I tend to use in all the if I have
[SPEAKER_00]: anything marked headband That's 99% of the
time what I'm using.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, cuz his homie had it for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean now We know that you know,
the original headband is the mama sour And
[SPEAKER_03]: was a very diesel type fluffy,
you know Yeah Fox tail e type cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these couple cuts that are floating
around that are that are called headband
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, they're not they're most
most things that are called headband are
[SPEAKER_03]: really great weed They're really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh geez.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but there's a few they're really
really really great og Kush types.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah And they're not related to New York,
which doesn't you know, it might fuck with
[SPEAKER_03]: some people's stories But it doesn't
change how nice the cut is itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it just happens to be Yeah,
it's it's different this dude saying it's
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not my LA cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not lupus cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the 707 It's not even a headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was renamed headband because
whatever name it had before was sketch
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so now it's just called headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: We called the 56 mostly as an identity
Identifier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because eventually you have to you
have to figure out some tag that allows
[SPEAKER_03]: That allows you to identify stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, I mean before the internet
we just called chem dog dog Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: we didn't need it to be skunk VA cut or
chem 91 or that like that's all internet
[SPEAKER_03]: names Yeah, so that people can communicate
about it and that's the same thing with
[SPEAKER_03]: the 56 it's a gorgeous og Kush Type plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's incredibly potent super flavorful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really nice It's probably the best
Kush I know of You know and it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: mysterious origin For someone's question
is there somewhere you can review this if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've missed the live feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes On the riot seeds the account.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on not right seed cover right seeds
You can go there's a little tab area where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a little play button you click
that And you can see all the videos that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've uploaded some people are asking if
we're gonna have the audio podcast back up
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna do my best to get that all
probably need some help with someone going
[SPEAKER_00]: and extracting the audio Portions of all
of these shows for the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think six episodes I need to get that so
if someone's really good with audio and
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys can extract that that would help
a ton I'd really like to get the audio
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast back up and going we got to learn
some stuff on the floor To keep this shit
[SPEAKER_00]: going, but we're gonna do our best to
manage it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah Yeah, and I mean we've been trying
to do these lives every Friday and be
[SPEAKER_03]: consistent I know a bunch of people like
to listen to them on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're sorry That it got delayed,
you know, you got a bunch of them up And
[SPEAKER_03]: then it all the sudden it it came down
people are described the flavoring of the
[SPEAKER_03]: 56 I wouldn't say that the 56 Has the best
Kush flavor?
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is that kind of Kush it doesn't
have a bunch of lemon like some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty it's got earthy,
but it's got that like Kushy type like
[SPEAKER_03]: mouth coat type thing, you know,
but it's got rare potency.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I mean when I'm not kidding when I
say it's like it's I mean There's some
[SPEAKER_03]: people if someone told me it was in their
top one or two favorite cuts as far as
[SPEAKER_03]: what it does to you Yeah, I wouldn't be
surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's it's in the top four or five
things that I have it's super Po it's
[SPEAKER_03]: really nice and it does this even though
it's even though it's very cushy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got this weird anxiety thing You
know, some people won't smoke it because
[SPEAKER_03]: it gives them massive anxiety.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it gets it gives me hella anxiety
Yeah, there's people that there's like
[SPEAKER_03]: there's friends of mine their wives and
stuff like that Matt and others like it
[SPEAKER_03]: gives it like tweaks them out and makes
them uncomfortable on a happy high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah You know doesn't do that for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just gets me hella baked for some
people it triggers them and it's not good
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what it is, but you always say
after you wake up from a nap after smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: it that your asshole hurts and I Super
weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean that's the company you keep Yeah
Inland So Cal, what can you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's one of those it's a it's it's one
of my favorite cuts It's a really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really nice plant You know,
it's it's it's It can be a finicky og.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean there's aspects where I There is no
difference between chem 91 and skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just different monikers for the
same cut I have a way James loud asked me
[SPEAKER_00]: that you got the chem 91 or you got the
skunk VA You know, there's more than one
[SPEAKER_03]: cut that floats around that is true So,
you know what you know, there's that but
[SPEAKER_03]: but it all those names originate from one
cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know and Yeah, and then you
know, so there's an aspect too where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like getting back to that Real science
could tell us one day what the 56 How
[SPEAKER_03]: closely it's related to other things?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it could take the oral history of
them and some of that mystery,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know and And it could clear that up
There is no answer to which one is better
[SPEAKER_03]: dear 91 because it's personal preference
You know, I would say both of them are in
[SPEAKER_03]: my all-time favorites But you know some
people I would say the opposite yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: some people don't like them, you know But
you know, there's there's an aspect where
[SPEAKER_03]: and someone asked this TK the original
Kush I think TK is likely one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: original hybrids Yeah, the question is is
we don't know how many we don't know what
[SPEAKER_03]: it is or exactly what it came from very
well Yeah, and we think that there might
[SPEAKER_03]: have been more than one and we think that
most Kush are bag seed or s ones from
[SPEAKER_03]: those originals But we don't know exactly
how many different originals there were
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we don't We know there's a lot of
bag seeds of bag seeds and sisters of
[SPEAKER_03]: sisters You know and things of that nature
and so it's hard and so that's another
[SPEAKER_03]: thing that that real science could explain
to us Yeah, perhaps one day You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually think to be honest this might
be controversial people might get pissed
[SPEAKER_03]: at me, but I think that That the the the
Kush that Josh D and and Matt and those
[SPEAKER_03]: guys brought to LA Is is likely lost?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I don't mean like lost like
nobody has it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Mean like the chain of custody got
fucked up enough and now it's that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: really hard to prove that this specific
one is guaranteed it and this person has
[SPEAKER_03]: had it and You know It's like it's it
might be out there as SFV.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it might be out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is 56 day headband It might be out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is this that the ghost of today is
not the ghost of yesterday There's
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple SFV cuts that flow it out there
No, yeah, there's so many renames and so
[SPEAKER_03]: much stuff happened in LA and the original
people lost it and got it back and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: that Like I think it might still exist but
under different monikers Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean and then we had certain companies
like Cali Connect They would make certain
[SPEAKER_00]: strain names like their seed lines would
be SFEOG So now a bunch of people are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing their seed lines and then they
have cuts of things called SFEOG now
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 3,000 SFEOG cuts all claiming to
be the original, you know, we did that
[SPEAKER_00]: with Larry He did it with Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did it with several So yeah,
the provenance on those are just damn near
[SPEAKER_03]: impossible now to go back and there's two
or three SFVs that are popularly traded
[SPEAKER_03]: Amongst people and they're different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, but there's an aspect
where it's like the TK At least you have
[SPEAKER_03]: really you have some pretty good chain of
custody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah in that cornbread Ricky Sent it but
even before he moved to California sent it
[SPEAKER_03]: to some people in California Yeah,
and then he brought it with him and it
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't appear to have gotten lost by the
original crew And there's still good chain
[SPEAKER_03]: of custody on that one You know the Josh
cut or you know the the Matt Bubba cut Or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever you want to call it like that one
got a little lost in the wave of the OG
[SPEAKER_03]: movement in SoCal Yeah, and so people can
say the 92 is that cut?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the Kush cut is that cut the Kush cut
is that cut the the ghost the real ghost
[SPEAKER_03]: is that cut the SFV that I have is that
cut and Then you put those four cuts in
[SPEAKER_03]: the room and you grow them all out next to
each other and they're not the same weed
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so some of those people are wrong or
They're the same cut brought to completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different environments Completely,
you know found a whole different way of
[SPEAKER_00]: expressing and now move back in to the
same environment They all express totally
[SPEAKER_00]: differently until they're acclimated to
that environment again So I mean that
[SPEAKER_03]: there was so much you LA was like the
perfect micro cut like to blow up in LA to
[SPEAKER_03]: be worth that much money Yeah,
and a culture that fronts so hard We went
[SPEAKER_03]: from like one cut showing up from these
Florida guys Yeah to like clubs full of
[SPEAKER_03]: only og within 15 years Yeah, and several
dozen og cuts at least Yeah, so how did
[SPEAKER_03]: that happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know is is the flow rider that I have
is that a sister to the stuff that Josh
[SPEAKER_03]: brought out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a sister to TK?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the same as the original Josh is it
I've grown it next to the real TK.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that one Is it a bag?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying like it you just
don't know but I mean but it goes back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the expression thing like it maybe it is
the same exact cut and they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: expressing totally differently because
they've been moved to two different
[SPEAKER_03]: environments and The hard part is that
that's why I do this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I believe I have a hard
time with acclimation Yeah, I do I like to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow things to see what they are
side-by-side in the same room same
[SPEAKER_03]: environment same food same everything
Uh-huh, you know, I'm not sure that taking
[SPEAKER_03]: it to Hawaii for four years Does some kind
of genetic change?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it does a genetic change,
but I think expression is expression and I
[SPEAKER_03]: think that's that's that's for real it
just I'm just saying that like this is
[SPEAKER_00]: another aspect where we just don't know
Yeah, I mean like like the first thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that really taught me this was cheese This
is a cologne that I had run out many times
[SPEAKER_00]: and every time I'd run it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled like funky foot cheese Get it
back from a great source Now I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: berry and then the next time I grow it
I've got one clone berry one clone fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: next to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look different and it's like What is
this just these little micro expressions
[SPEAKER_00]: and and you know with CSI that was one of
the ones that really he pointed out the
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental expression is everything and
you just can't make any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusions based on growing if you if
you've gotten the same clone supposedly
[SPEAKER_00]: from different sources You can't make any
conclusions about it them being the same
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of not because of that environmental
so that's what I was saying about wanting
[SPEAKER_03]: to grow the same plant in the same Room or
the same greenie or the same environment
[SPEAKER_00]: with the same food at the same time Yeah,
I think I think that makes sense but over
[SPEAKER_00]: you know a period of a year or two I think
it would take for it to reactivate to the
[SPEAKER_00]: so that makes it really hard It makes it
fucking way hard and it makes it even more
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing I'm trying to make any kind of
claim on whether something is or isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: something you know And you know,
but there are there are when you grow them
[SPEAKER_03]: side-by-side It's not like you have to
only wait on the flower Yeah, you know if
[SPEAKER_03]: you like whoa, these leaves are a
different color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the serrations are looking slight
are looking different Yeah, like there's
[SPEAKER_03]: other observational things that you can
do, you know, and so I do believe like I
[SPEAKER_03]: actually I actually got I actually got a
chem 91 cut right recently simply because
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to grow it right next to mine and
Yeah, because I've they've been grown and
[SPEAKER_03]: held and kept separately for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but they're the same thing They're
they're they're vegging and I'm growing
[SPEAKER_03]: them next to each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't blew them out yet But I'm
curious is like I guarantee I know for
[SPEAKER_03]: sure They're the exact same cut and I know
who's held it and how long and the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: bit But they've been in completely
different environments for a really long
[SPEAKER_00]: time The other thing I'd wonder too is
like as one of them been in a place where
[SPEAKER_00]: they use harsh chemicals for a long time
over You know many years and stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that Yeah, you know, you know all that
stuff environment, you know, like I even
[SPEAKER_03]: wonder sometimes like, you know Sometimes
you get you get a weak plant or you have
[SPEAKER_03]: an accident or something and you have to
save a plant or you get a plant That's in
[SPEAKER_03]: bad health and you have to nurse it back
for a while because it went through some
[SPEAKER_03]: hell or something You know, how does that
change?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you get it back perfectly healthy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there are there the same cuts floating
out there of the same plant that are just
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be younger and healthier?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they didn't get the tar beat out
of them It's hard to say You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I know I've had OG KB and then I've
had OG KB from a source that kept it super
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking healthy with mad elites cut Where
I never seen it express grow as fast or or
[SPEAKER_00]: have the turps that it did But it was
definitely the same cut and I'm not even
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about her details Just so people
know like I'm not talking about dudding or
[SPEAKER_03]: HP, you know or anything like that I'm
just talking about two things that we know
[SPEAKER_03]: are the same that go their own path for a
long time Yeah, which one you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's the same cut but are they all of
equal health?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Do they stack the same?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they smell the same?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they look the same was their drip
because when it comes to me for drift
[SPEAKER_03]: people say Oh genetic shift is real.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that it's real I don't think
it is but I don't know that it's not real
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we know what epigenetics is but I
don't think we fully understand
[SPEAKER_00]: epigenetics and how they apply to cannabis
very well But I think that's what most
[SPEAKER_03]: people refer to I mean I'll say for sure
that My LA my headband cut it's definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: gotten more sensitive inside over the
years Yeah, it used you know, 15 years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing was an indoor beast Yeah But
sometimes there's a weird thing where I
[SPEAKER_03]: almost wonder I almost had this thought of
like well, what if I went back to
[SPEAKER_03]: single-ended hortiluxes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just turned into a beast again,
and it's that we updated the lights and it
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't like the new lights Yeah You know
and you're like, oh I got old back in the
[SPEAKER_03]: day I grew it and it looked like this
Yeah, and then you change a bunch of shit
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're like, oh it doesn't look like
that anymore Can't be any of the changes I
[SPEAKER_03]: made.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah That would be interesting to know
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, but then you're like some little
guy or whatever, you know So it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: where do you where do you get the
opposite?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you get to do these different
environmental experiments?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and to see if things are the same
cut or the same this or like maybe they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't like the same light Yeah,
you know I did this thing I did this
[SPEAKER_03]: experiment where I grew some head stash
under only ceramic metal halides Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned the shit before but the dog
shit, which I normally take 12 plus weeks
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah was done in ten and I cut the chem 91
down at 85 days and it still had white
[SPEAKER_03]: hairs all over the top I believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and like was the longest I've ever
taken it I normally take it 68 or 70 or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that, but it was like full
two weeks Longer than I've ever taken it
[SPEAKER_03]: and it still didn't look done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that was just spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Was all that was the only thing that was
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Same room same food same this same
hose watering everything same organic
[SPEAKER_03]: inputs all that shit did some stuff not
purple too I didn't actually have any
[SPEAKER_03]: purple stuff in In that experiment I had
what I tried to do is I grew some stuff I
[SPEAKER_03]: knew really well like the headband and the
chem D and Five or six different things
[SPEAKER_03]: and I grew them under the lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was growing the rest of the shit Yeah,
and then I grew those same strains in the
[SPEAKER_03]: same room But like in a corner where there
was only ceramic metal halides I had set
[SPEAKER_03]: up Yeah, and so the only difference that
they were getting was the spectrum of
[SPEAKER_03]: light That's funny, you know came out wave
some things didn't come out very different
[SPEAKER_03]: than each other And then a few strains
were like way fucking different like I
[SPEAKER_03]: remember telling Caleb that I pulled the
Fucking dog shit at ten weeks Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and he laughed at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started sending him pics And yeah,
like don't you think it's done?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know Yeah Am I gonna lose you
again?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they're delayed You looked
weird for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you there testing one two three?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I fucked now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is he fucked?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's me or you I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to tell I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hear me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's me Yeah, it might be you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, there's so I can think of all
these different experiments and Matt's
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking of different experiments,
too Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but enacting all of those to
eliminate variables is a time-consuming
[SPEAKER_03]: money bitch It's just the hole you're
pouring shit into to try to learn more
[SPEAKER_00]: about a plan Almost all of my my
experiments that I ran over the years were
[SPEAKER_00]: all based around weather or reversals and
weather Something to do with purples and
[SPEAKER_00]: plants one of the funny thing was I became
obsessed with and convinced that metal
[SPEAKER_00]: metal halide must be the way to to get the
purples to express the best and much later
[SPEAKER_00]: on I learned that That was probably the
most opposite and stupid bro science
[SPEAKER_00]: theory I could have had because it
actually reduces the amount of purples
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see and that is conclusive Yeah,
so yeah, you know we have and I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: think like I you know, I've been posting
on my stories the last few days My friend
[SPEAKER_03]: did some grew out some of my sour,
you know Yeah, and I wanted people to see
[SPEAKER_03]: it and it started some convos or whatever
And I don't really I think the diesels are
[SPEAKER_03]: such a close family That like I don't
really think that you can compare them
[SPEAKER_03]: unless you grow them in the same room at
the same time Yeah, or the same greenhouse
[SPEAKER_03]: or the same outdoors?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the same whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think like you were talking
earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you can take two totally
different environments and different
[SPEAKER_03]: regimens Yeah, and then put that in the
jar and be like is this the same weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no You know what gives the most perp
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Everything else is just trying to
coax the genetics to do what you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but some genetics just give it And
doesn't matter, you know, yep,
[SPEAKER_03]: it doesn't matter But yeah, even just
figuring out all this stuff some of this
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff is some of this stuff is uh,
you know, um It's it's very observational,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, yeah getting back to phylos
phylos thought every cut of fucking sour
[SPEAKER_03]: diesel They sent in was the exact same
cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah and og and og and at the time I was
growing out a bunch of these diesel cuts
[SPEAKER_03]: next to mine and next to the headbands and
stuff to try to figure shit out Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: they were obviously different related But
you know some had light green leaves some
[SPEAKER_03]: had dark green leaves some had different
serrations some had Different maturity
[SPEAKER_03]: rates you staffed different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you all smells all kinds of stuff
Yeah, you know all kinds of stuff and so
[SPEAKER_03]: You know dudes asking is that the sour I
grew up with I don't know dude I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know It would be nice if it somehow ended
up with me and I saved it, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that would be cool I can say that I
haven't lost it in over two decades Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know That's what I can say about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know time will tell I suppose I mean I
even just got a sour from Caleb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just cuz I want to grow it next to
mine and See just do the side-by-side I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: 99% sure his is the same one that me and
Pip and everyone else all use an archive
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the chocolate is that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the one I call choco mine's not that
one Yeah, I know that's so weird,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, but it's like and and so I don't
know I don't you know I I thought for the
[SPEAKER_03]: longest time I helpfully called It sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and people will be like,
well, what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, it's the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what name?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know I'm no idea and I thought
when I gathered up all those sours I would
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got ECSD I got NYCD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got Joe B.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got Amish.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got Choco.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got easy, you know, I got this I got
this I got this and it's none of you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, it's none of us so and then none of
them were my My headband cut either Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was figuring at least some the one thing
that it did seem it did seem like the
[SPEAKER_03]: Choco and the ECSD were the same plant
Yeah, yeah at least the versions of them
[SPEAKER_00]: that I got I was the first person to call
it Choco and it was only because I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: Choco's picture and I was like,
hey, that's fucking Which one which which
[SPEAKER_00]: sours you run in the one that looks like
Choco's?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that's the one but it was
it was always labeled ECSD always and
[SPEAKER_03]: what's funny is that it wasn't until like
if it wasn't for Matt and Pip and some of
[SPEAKER_03]: our other close friends I probably
wouldn't have done that experiment Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: because they kept bugging me about what
sour I had and I was like The one I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even know there was so many
because I got it so early I just never got
[SPEAKER_03]: another one because I had it So why would
I trade for sour diesel when I have a nice
[SPEAKER_03]: sour diesel and I didn't realize that it
was You know that there was so many Did
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it was the fucking Amherst?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you did you try that one that Amherst?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that the Amherst and The
upstate New York and the real there's like
[SPEAKER_03]: four or five names Then I don't that Matt
can probably verify that I don't I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: think they existed Five or ten years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's a name.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of there's a ton of new
names There's a different amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a certain amount of new names You
know that have come out And there was a
[SPEAKER_03]: decent amount of names in the forum era.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, and I don't know like I
just lived in Mendo I got the sour in 2000
[SPEAKER_03]: or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had it a couple couple decades now
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we didn't lose it and We thought
that was sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Remember there was an era where almost
everyone's sour diesel was Soma's New York
[SPEAKER_00]: City diesel for a long time in the
community 99% of the shit people were
[SPEAKER_00]: turning up with as sour was NYCD
grapefruit Hunter just yeah hunter
[SPEAKER_03]: mountain, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't even Know like,
you know, I'm not even dissing hunter
[SPEAKER_03]: mountain or this or that or whatever I'm
just saying that they weren't names in
[SPEAKER_03]: common usage amongst traded cuts Yeah,
you know and you know and so You know and
[SPEAKER_03]: there it seems like there was multiple
phenos of sour even to begin with yeah You
[SPEAKER_00]: know and then it became the master trying
to trying to declare the one the original
[SPEAKER_00]: the only sour is pretty redundant now that
we know I mean pretty Pretty convinced
[SPEAKER_00]: that there were at least two or three
sours going around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and three diesels I should say I can
say I can say you know that I When I got
[SPEAKER_03]: it and that we've held it since and
honestly, you know back then in the early
[SPEAKER_03]: 2000s or whatever Like I didn't ask for
all that lineage Yeah I didn't ask of
[SPEAKER_03]: where it came from and how it got there
and all that different stuff and like
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to figure that out 15 20 years
later is a mess Yeah, I just got it then
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and I have this thing where it's
like if I like weed I'll try to hold on to
[SPEAKER_03]: the weed Yeah, whether or not it becomes
popular and what happens to most people is
[SPEAKER_03]: they get rid of anything?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not popular and then they try to
get it back and it's not the same shit
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that's why everyone's like
where's the real granddaddy perps?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the real this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the real what now it's where's the
real sour?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, someone's asking about sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the the sour across the blue
bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty good for a Regular sour seed
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of berry comes through archives
got some amazing sour crosses CSI has got
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing sour crosses And top dogs got
amazing sour stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah Now that it's gained in popularity
There's a bunch more people that are
[SPEAKER_03]: coming out of the woodwork with labeled
sours and they're all old and they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing and they're all this and that and
I think skunk VA probably has some too but
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, that's who I'd recommend because
they're So many people coming out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: woodwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know who to trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch There's a bunch right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are asking about the spyrox our
spyrox our isn't sour spyrox our It's
[SPEAKER_03]: something that's sold through some
nurseries out on the West Coast here It's
[SPEAKER_03]: not a bad cut but it's sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's some it's some sour cut across the
cush Yeah, because they were going for
[SPEAKER_03]: like sour stretchiness, but like more
density You know and all that and so it's
[SPEAKER_03]: some hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an it's not a Real sour cut
someone's asking about skunk Tex diesel I
[SPEAKER_00]: gave him the day record diesel But his
what he calls the original diesel came
[SPEAKER_00]: from someone else for our last month or
probably the last time we talked about it
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not the day record diesel that
he's referring to Yeah, I mean it came
[SPEAKER_03]: from his buddy It seems like and it yeah,
and the dude got diesel, you know back on
[SPEAKER_03]: the East Coast back when Diesel was slang
for fireweed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we're not even sure how it's
Related or whatever else because he just
[SPEAKER_03]: got it is I mean the only reason why he
calls it original diesel is The guy that
[SPEAKER_03]: gave it to him is because that's the
diesel he got first Yeah, which is that I
[SPEAKER_00]: passed him the day record as original
diesel So when I saw him post that and say
[SPEAKER_00]: he got it from that dude I was like what
the fuck but it turned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did get a different cut for someone
else Yeah, you did get a different cut and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the name game, you know,
and it's like that is yeah You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like I mean at some of these things
you see people making all kinds of claims
[SPEAKER_03]: about sour diesel I try to stay away from
all that because I got my cut in 2000 or
[SPEAKER_03]: so and Which is long as time ago now,
but it's still you know, it's still years
[SPEAKER_03]: after it was it was popped Yeah,
and I got it on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I'm not even old enough to have been
around for when sour was first getting
[SPEAKER_00]: popular and being from the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really It like it's kind of like me,
you know, I don't know it Me trying to say
[SPEAKER_00]: that I would know what a real sour was or
the original sour was this I compare all
[SPEAKER_03]: sour diesels to the sour diesel cut I have
and not because I I'm just like all like
[SPEAKER_03]: all mine's the best or whatever But mostly
because that's my comparison point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the sour that I had forever
That's what I consider to be sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like is it the I don't know,
you know It's hard to say People are
[SPEAKER_00]: asking about the original diesel in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So archive his original diesel is the
shroomy diesel if I remember correctly And
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that we have as original diesel is
just the day wrecker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was because Yes, yeah, that's same
thing shroomy diesel Bahamas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah And original I ran then there's day
wrecker original and Day wreck original is
[SPEAKER_00]: my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's it's one of the most potent
cuts that I have and potent breeders that
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Yeah, I you know, so all I can say
is that most people don't keep things
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless it's popular and it's easy to sell
Yeah, I hold on to things that I like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, so I held on to that sour even
when it was really unpopular Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then people are like, how did the good
sour go away?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cuz nobody wanted to most good cuts
go away Because people aren't willing to
[SPEAKER_03]: hold them when they're not popular Yeah,
and then everyone wants them back as soon
[SPEAKER_03]: as there's money to be made and there's
rep to be had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep Simple as that over and over and over
Yeah, you know, so then so how does that
[SPEAKER_03]: all work?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like they only want it you could I
could spread out my diesel and if No,
[SPEAKER_03]: and if if in five years, nobody was into
sour a tiny percentage of heads would keep
[SPEAKER_03]: it Yeah, cuz that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happened to Urkel That's what
happened to green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what happened to everything Yeah,
she it's a lot of shits gone that I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another cut the other day someone
hit me up and asked for forum and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like what you mean want forum?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Forms missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like I can't find forum and I'm like
we can't find forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's a whore cut But yeah,
that's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see people and I'm not making if
anyone's listening and this is you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: take offense But I was like man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want that real sour diesel from like
back in 2010 Yeah You know and you think
[SPEAKER_03]: about it and it's like that's not that
long ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no It turns out You know,
we don't know what you cut skunk tech sour
[SPEAKER_03]: is Identifying sours is really hard You
know, it seems like it seems like at the
[SPEAKER_03]: very least what you can say by people that
are trying my sour right now Is that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: not very well circulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it's not one of the common named
cuts Yeah You know, okay my ring my rings
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna keep going off non-stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could probably try to end it soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is driving me nuts Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we are an hour and 50 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're doing good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing all right So yeah,
I mean we can do we tried to talk a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bro science and stuff like that and ended
up on cuts But that's the hardest part for
[SPEAKER_03]: me as a collector is that nobody wants to
fucking help me back shit up when shit's
[SPEAKER_03]: unpopular Yeah, then everybody wants it
when they can make some money off it and
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it goes back to nobody wants to help
you back it up because it's unpopular
[SPEAKER_00]: Rinse repeat and we're about to enter the
most abundant time of the shit
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if people can hear me or
whatever But Matt and I it seemed to be on
[SPEAKER_03]: different different wavelengths again
Yeah, slightly slightly different
[SPEAKER_03]: wavelengths Can you hear me anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just look delayed Yeah, all right Yes,
is there anything else you want to cover
[SPEAKER_00]: before we close it up?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we can close it up This evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're all good every we kept
everybody entertained for an hour and 50
[SPEAKER_03]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably pretty good but You know
there yeah, there's a there's a thing
[SPEAKER_03]: where we are gonna try to get the podcasts
up on Podcast format so more people can
[SPEAKER_00]: listen and hear them You know everybody
know you can listen to this you can watch
[SPEAKER_00]: the live feed It won't have the comments
But you can always go back and listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: the live feed on the riots eats Instagram
under the video section all this you can
[SPEAKER_00]: replay I always leave these ones up With
me and not so always up I have one of them
[SPEAKER_03]: that I did when I covered when Matt wasn't
able to make it But I don't have a bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: of them, but on my page.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have one of them.
