[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_00]: counterculture that is Canna.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_00]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be joined by members of the Canna
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_00]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_00]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: We finally hit 10,000 subscribers,
which is massive for a niche nerdy topic
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it wasn't really thought possible by
anyone, let alone me.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that said, we want to do a contest
for everyone, and it also kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: coincides with our Instagram page being
totally knocked down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided we would do like one for
Instagram and one separately for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon people, and that one will be a
little bit bigger because it's a paid
[SPEAKER_00]: membership.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, for Instagram, make sure you go
follow breeders.syndicate.podcast on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have to put something up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as I hate the platform and how it
treats anything cannabis, even history,
[SPEAKER_00]: without any advertising for anything other
than a show, but we have to play that game
[SPEAKER_00]: and we like to get the word out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please go follow us there to be
eligible for this contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to give away a free pack from
me, a free pack from Goat Farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a free pack from H&L for that contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to end the contest,
let me see, on the 23rd of next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means the winner will be announced
on March 1st show at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure if you win, not to use your
real name, because I'm going to announce
[SPEAKER_00]: it on the show and stuff, and that'll be
fun, but I don't want to like dox anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have that for the Instagram people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to be following, you have to
be following the page or you won't be
[SPEAKER_00]: eligible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I'm picking the poll from and
we're going to randomize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the Patreon and Discord people,
we're not only going to have those three
[SPEAKER_00]: packs, we're also going to have a large
bottle of reversal spray, which is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big price and I wanted to make it
extra special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably throw in a little bit more
for the Patreon people because they've
[SPEAKER_00]: done so much to be a part of driving this
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have time, you have time to join the
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's $5 a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not asking a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have our 50 tier that is going to
get filled soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do that every three months,
but it's filled with three things,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a free pack from me, a pack from High
Lonesome and a pack from Goat Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm stoked for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everyone, for helping us make
the 10K subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do owe a massive debt of gratitude to
Thousandfold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without him, one, there'd be no show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've said that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think people get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of comments talking about how,
you know, they prefer one coast over the
[SPEAKER_00]: other because they got so used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And realistically, if that was still going
on, there wouldn't be a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have that even mindset to push to
10K.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think it was possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really wasn't a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal was just trying to keep myself
interested enough to keep doing the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a while, it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's special to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's special to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope we can make it special for you
and everyone watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, make sure you're either part of
the Patreon or following on breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: .syndicate.podcast on IG to be entered.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not asking much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, with that said, we have our show
up this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the outdoor part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next week, we are diving back into
breeding very heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm revisiting an old episode I was
really not super stoked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just about how it was produced by
myself, the actual content and where it
[SPEAKER_00]: led to some misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've always said, like, if anything
changes, if anything comes to light,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will update it and we will make the
information correct as correct as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm first and foremost to push for
that just because I'm anal about that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go into breeding deeper in a very
popular subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, with that said, go join the
contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do anything for the
Instagram one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be a part of the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bigger package, bigger contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So five dollars gets you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to sit at the table with the
Syndicate?

[SPEAKER_00]: We also have an underground Syndicate
Discord where we get together and solve
[SPEAKER_00]: old strain history together daily.

from IG and it's an amazing resource for
[SPEAKER_00]: old catalogs and knowledge.

growers.

We'll see you next time.
