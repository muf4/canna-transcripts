[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_03]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_03]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_03]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_03]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our mission is to combat the narrative of
the corporate cannabis industry when seed
[SPEAKER_03]: posers are obfuscating for their own
financial benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any experience with Uptown
Haze, PIF?
[SPEAKER_01]: NL5 Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: The PIF, Cuban Black, the cough,
the dog shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I strongly believe they're all just NL5
Haze, just renamed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of those seeds sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just did work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just made a cross with one of my lemon
trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made some femme seeds with a lemon tree
of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so glad you brought it here,
to lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those NL5 Haze, they're dominant when
you cross them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The time I played around with them,
they've always taken over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the past, I wasn't much of a fan of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just made my head spin a little too
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, I've been smoking them more and
more and enjoying them more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting older, so my body's changing
or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminds me of Cat Piss a little bit,
NL5 Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that funky, especially in the
air.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're at a concert or something and
someone lights one of those up,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see heads whipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just did those lemon tree PIFs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow like the PIF, tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the flavors have been ranging from
lemon tree to the PIF and everything in
[SPEAKER_01]: between.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your sourcing for the PIF?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cuban Black Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the Cuban Black Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then my buddy said it came from one of the
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did he say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Dark Heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple City Genetics is where my buddy got
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me a couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me that one and a different one
from that PIF Coast guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something three, PIF Coast three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember, but I like the Cuban
Black a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were you going to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was growing those two hazes,
the other one from PIF Coast, the number
[SPEAKER_01]: three, looked hella good, hella frosty,
finished earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my climate, it got powdery mildew a
little too forming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I decided to stay against that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like easy growing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like plants where after I harvest it,
I can take off a bud right off the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: without curing it and making my mouth
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm always going after.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff that I got to cure and wait,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it to taste good right off the
fucking bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my strains that I work with,
that's what they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: CSI specifically wanted me to ask you
about lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew one of the lemon tree brokers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Young guy, anyhow, he pretty much branded
lemon tree and another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time he'd buy packs, he would find
seeds inside of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He ended up giving me about a hundred
seeds, a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're essentially lemon tree hermy
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The actual clone is outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew out all the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them popped out looking like sour
diesel, even smelling like sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best were short, different degrees of
shortness, different degrees of that turp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody says lemon tree, lemony,
but to me, I smell California orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it's more orangey, but I don't know
what you want to call those turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked out the best citrus, strong
citrus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grew all the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Picked out seven that I picked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: From those seven came down to three of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: From those three, I kept the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave the guy that gave me the seeds all
the cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: He ended up giving them out to a couple of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: He used one of those cuts to make his
melanate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all kept the one that was the easiest
to grow, that had really good turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the grand flora guy used.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that I ended up keeping was a
little bit harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely finicky with the
overwatering, but it had more turps than
[SPEAKER_01]: the other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a little bit more finicky to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's why the other guys never
really went with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much to tell about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hermes seeds, grew them all out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I started back-crossing,
back-crossing, and back-crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stress out everything just to make sure
they don't herm on me and go over again
[SPEAKER_01]: until they're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the lemon tree, have you ever tried
the Oregon lemon diesel prior to the lemon
[SPEAKER_03]: tree?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always wondered when different people
try the lemon tree, if they see any
[SPEAKER_03]: relation to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting that you see so much
diesel in it too, because that story's
[SPEAKER_03]: always stuck with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, especially the guys from
Oregon, always say the lemon tree is just
[SPEAKER_01]: that Oregon lemon diesel renamed,
which I think very well could be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you tried lemon G?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you think of that, comparatively?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tall, easy-grown plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather grow a calio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it is calio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Calio, it just tasted good, smelled good,
but there wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon G was pretty similar to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lemon tree is by far the best citrusy
ganja plant that I've come across.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a good buzz to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it's one of the strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I smoke it for two or three days,
it's not getting me that high anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first few days, it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I'm smoking some lemon tree G33
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Decent?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up growing them all out myself
this year and picked out a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing the little smoke testers
the past few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow like the gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look like gelato, but have straight,
citrusy, raspberry flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Total improvement on both, I think,
on both strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the ultimate goal at the very end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Improve something structure-wise,
flavor-wise, potency-wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always a reason why I'm doing
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like I'm going to go and just
cross this, so a bunch of everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always some kind of madness behind
the thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the lemon tree reversals that I did,
I picked out easy, tall, growing plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: cross the lemon tree, because the lemon
tree is short and squat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted a tall, fast-growing,
lemon tree flavor, but stony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything I picked out, like the Blue
Dream, or the Pith, and gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also did a GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked the GMO a couple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like it spits out a lot of Hermes
on me, with every cross done with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew out all the fucking gelato ones,
so I don't have any more of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Blue Dream and the Piths, I ended up
releasing those just recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: A total improvement on both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Dream, I know a lot of people hate
it, but I love it, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the high of Blue Dream,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: The high, the taste, the smell,
all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's grown out right, it's fucking
delicious, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these lemon tree Blue Dream ones,
the ones that are right in the middle with
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor-wise, where you got a little bit of
that Blue Dream, they're fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: delicious, and the frost factor has just
increased to 100-folds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both just complemented each other
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people don't know, and I don't
know how much you want to talk about this
[SPEAKER_03]: in detail, but a lot of us that receive
Chem 91 later on owe you a debt of
[SPEAKER_03]: gratitude for it even reaching our hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you open to talk about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: About which one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Say that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem 91?
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that from Jason Sinclair.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was at my neighbor's house in Willets
over there, and then I went over there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we started talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember Not-So-Dog at one of the
Harvest parties, early 2000s, raving about
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem 91, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Him and a couple other people of his crew,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you guys don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It built up in me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard it from them for a while,
and then one day, I was at my neighbor's
[SPEAKER_01]: house, and Skunk V.A.'s over there,
and we started yapping and chatting.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, dude, I got the Chem 91,
and then he started talking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydrosaur guy in Willets who also had the
fucking Chem 91 so I knew he was legit
[SPEAKER_01]: because he knew all the same people and
where he came from and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I told him, I was like, dude,
I just play around making seeds for
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kick down the cut, make seeds,
and I'll give you seeds of every
[SPEAKER_01]: direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ended up taking that Chem 91 to
Backcross 3, and then what did I get?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Chem 4s and all that,
the Chem 1, 2, 3, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Came out, and Caleb hooked me up with all
of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spector gave me all of those, and I grew
all those out, and that 4 was just
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking, to me, was the best one,
flavor-wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest are, they're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Chem 91, to me, is very OG to me,
flavor-wise, but SFV, to me, was way,
[SPEAKER_01]: way, way better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Infinitely, and easier to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chem 91's ugly, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that Chem 9 was hella finicky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyhow, I ended up giving SkunkVA seeds
for every single cross that I made with
[SPEAKER_01]: this Chem 91, and then I gave him a bunch
of Chem 4 seeds and whatnot, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that was the Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Came from him, and then I gave it to
Caleb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rest is history from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubba, Bubba, Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the back-sourcing story on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, a lot of us owe a debt of gratitude
for you for us even having Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubba I got from another glassblower
bishop, really talented glassblower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he got it, I remember him saying he
got it from this guy that would,
[SPEAKER_01]: all I remember, he would just pack fat
bowls, take one hit, and then spit out the
[SPEAKER_01]: bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be Oregon kid, is what it sounds
like to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, he gave me the cut in 99,
I think it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me a cut of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, from that, I passed it around to
random folks here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of guys on the old forums back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fletch, you know, and that's how I met
Fletch for the second time and became
[SPEAKER_01]: really good friends after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, most of all these things came from
back in the day with the glassblowing
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were- Trinity?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Trinity- Mayor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trinity, I got from Caleb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've grown that out a couple of times
and I've made a bunch of crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one is one where you need to grow a
shit ton of seeds and root, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes out with all different kinds of
flavors and looks, growth structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Another, I forgot, when Jason gave me the
clone of the Chem 91, he also gave me a
[SPEAKER_01]: shit ton of Hermes seeds from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I dug through that and there was some
weird, fun stuff in that Chem 91,
[SPEAKER_01]: like some full-on indica plants popping
up, some real short, squatty, like
[SPEAKER_01]: Pakistani kind of looking leaves,
not so thick and wide, but more slender.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was some interesting stuff in
there, but I never came across one that
[SPEAKER_01]: had that gas in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember they were a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You did his favorite run of sour diesel
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think he said you use power flower
nudes, flower power.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a, it was dirt brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a bag of dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy, the guy that made that was up
in Trinity County.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a funny story.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy that made that was in Trinity
County.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had like this fog or some shit on
his property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what he did was he just fucking dug
that shit up, threw it in the chipper and
[SPEAKER_01]: then bagged it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it was, it was all the rave
back in the early 2000s, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there was no pearlizing in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you had to mix all that shit in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sour diesel that he's talking about is
I had a, I had a house in the sunset
[SPEAKER_01]: district in San Francisco and these houses
are built to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the meter, so the garages are all
tandem style, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were able to like, you know,
build a wall next to the garage door.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you had the whole back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some people, the meter,
like the, the PG&E guys would have to come
[SPEAKER_01]: in and like look through a little window
for the meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they weren't able actually to get the
meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never did this, but some people could
have tapped into that shit hell easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was growing, I was growing sour in
this house and next door, I had a grower
[SPEAKER_01]: to the left of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the right of me was like maybe a
brothel house or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes the place would get stunky
and it's, you know, I'm like two blocks
[SPEAKER_01]: from the beach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So powdery mildew is the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd always have to turn it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sulfur burners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I would turn them on,
I would just put it on a timer and leave
[SPEAKER_01]: and then come back eight hours later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But every time I would come back,
the, the people in the store in the awful
[SPEAKER_01]: place, like they would be all in the
driveway and spitting on my driveway and
[SPEAKER_01]: flicking their cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must've made the place stink pretty
bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day the other grower came over and he
was like, bro, there's these things called
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon scrubbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I tend to have a fucking
stinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sour though, what I've found is
you're going to lose a lot of your yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you, if you root balance our diesel
grow in a small pot, the buds get super
[SPEAKER_01]: dense on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets super dense and crazy,
crazy frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like all that fucking turf just gets
crazy, like concentrated for some reason,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the yields, you lose a lot of yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tons of yield.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gets lost on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's, you know, what,
what do you want?
[SPEAKER_01]: I always went after the best possible
smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yield was the last thing on my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terps first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's where that sour came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Power flower and age old is what I used
back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gets good advice, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So root bound power.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can't get power flower now,
obviously the end of that story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you mind telling it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened to the bog?
[SPEAKER_01]: To the what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the bog guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so yeah, the power flower guy,
he ended up getting in trouble with the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking environmentalists.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, for digging all that shit out and
ended up, they ended up shutting him out,
[SPEAKER_01]: shutting him down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it was like an ancient, like redwood
forest bed, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, it was just like, um,
a pond that he fucking drained out and dug
[SPEAKER_01]: it all out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he just throw everything through
a fucking wood chipper and, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, bag it up in these brown bags and just
say power flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I fucking made a killing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was like, it was all good back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you weren't grown with it, you weren't
cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy goat farm grew a bunch of,
uh, train wreck in the power flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was talking about it today earlier
and that reminded me to bring it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what am I, one of the things that I'm
most fascinated with that you've worked
[SPEAKER_03]: with that I've never, I've never even
grown a cut of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've only grown hybrids because it's not
widely passed or, you know, is the purple
[SPEAKER_03]: indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you tell us about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, another one comes from archive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he sourced it up in a Seattle area,
um, short style, grapey molded hell easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it floating around Northern
California, but they called the purple
[SPEAKER_01]: fish back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then what else?
[SPEAKER_01]: It had another name to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultraviolet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they might've called it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, I got that from Fletch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, besides that, I have no idea of
the history behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Short little plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I just remember the mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would mold so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like the first thing to hold on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gnarly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful plant, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: How was the smoke from it?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one thing I, I don't know for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grapey ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, not, not like, not like earth or cold
grape, but, uh, grapey, skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: To it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like an old school purple laffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old school purple, Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Broadleaf, short, um, big, big,
uh, like arm size buds on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor, indoor, uh, different,
you know, still short kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: but more like, uh, bubba size buds on it,
you know, outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole, the whole plant would turn into
a bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always just wondered why,
like what, what was, what was the reason
[SPEAKER_03]: that it remained so locked other than just
mystery?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm just, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that, like Albert Walker and,
uh, the Malawi all those floated around
[SPEAKER_01]: the Washington area quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was another one like PES,
team PES or some shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're, they're, they're,
they're jam over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: More of the Steve's I remember back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: They liked a lot of the Steve plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, about every 10 years,
it seems like the trend kind of changes to
[SPEAKER_01]: something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you noticed that most people lost
their OG cuts?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you get hit up about that a lot?
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so out of the loop, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, um, I'm getting old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't talk to nobody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't buy weed from anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, like, I don't even know how much weed
goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know the prices anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had no clue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the one, the one thing I've been
hearing a lot is I've been getting tons of
[SPEAKER_03]: DMs from other seed makers and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one kept OG cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a feeling you're, you're OG
seed, seed, uh, sales are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: skyrocket soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's heavily in demand and no one
kept them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have noticed that they, uh, has been
doing a little bit better than the other
[SPEAKER_01]: strengths so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I see a lot of people are going back
to ours as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed like it's, it's making,
so the gas is coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as it should, because, uh,
you know, we nowadays looks fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, I mean, it's the most beautiful I've
ever seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's just not much to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it all looks the same now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all, they don't really have the turps
that I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, like OG is still my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my go-to, uh, the gas OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hard to beat, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That, that flavor, that lip smacking
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor, uh, and the fact is just like,
it just never disappoints.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always, uh, it always works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to ask about one, a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one, I've heard you mentioned recently,
it's called the PC three and it's an NL
[SPEAKER_02]: five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The PC three, uh, the PC three was that
one from Piftos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like I was saying that that's the,
uh, I grew it side by side with the Cuban
[SPEAKER_01]: black cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that PC three looked,
looked incredible, had the flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: had that deep Hayes flavor, uh,
finished, finished or the, the Cuban
[SPEAKER_01]: black.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but for me and my climate,
like it just, it got powdery mildew a
[SPEAKER_01]: little too easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I didn't stick with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the powdery mildew is a fuck you up
out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of stay away from plants that
get it super easy or plants that mold hell
[SPEAKER_01]: easy or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was some, um, blockhead and love
candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, what was your favorite expressions to
come out of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so love can block and love can,
you're the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as I asked breeder Steve, I was like,
Hey man, you know, I've been, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, working the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you cool if I release it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was just like, you know,
as long as you don't call a blockhead,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a fuck what you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, um, that you, that was my cash
proper in the late nineties, early two
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the cushion cleaner ended up replacing
that blockhead for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, back then outdoor, it finished
early and it had the look, it had that
[SPEAKER_01]: almost an indoor look where actually a lot
of people were passing it off as indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: Melanie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a cantaloupe melon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, typical spice of life flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, easy to grow fucking hell easy to trim
produce big and just crazy frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so like I said, it was my cashcropper
for days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, uh, I work that, I worked that one
heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I back crossed it a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I lost the clone and then buddy
mind, uh, Kendo used to go online by
[SPEAKER_00]: Kendo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he, he still had it in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he ended up passing it all throughout
Oregon and then he brought it back to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but back crossed it another time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I don't remember what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cops came or I lost the cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then from there I started,
um, going F1, F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: F3 with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but like cashcropper again,
early, um, uh, like every seed comes out
[SPEAKER_01]: identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no, there's no variation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the ultimate, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for me anyways, like if I release
something, I want it to be uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my goal for, uh, outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I wanted to grow a hundred seeds of,
of one variety and I wanted to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: mix everything together and have no one
know the difference.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that, that's, that was always the
goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all like my heavily worked stuff,
all of that comes out, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: identical, good readers, everything's the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can get crazy variation or
nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, of course there's slight,
slight little differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one tastes a little bit more than
the other, but they all have the same turf
[SPEAKER_03]: profile, you know, compared to like the
lines compared to the lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even 15, 20 years ago, it's, it,
the, the uniformity is vastly different
[SPEAKER_03]: though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There'd be small differences, but to most
people, they wouldn't even probably notice
[SPEAKER_03]: those differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people aren't going to know the
differences at all, but me, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: since, uh, I'm attached to them and,
uh, you know, I'm my worst critics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I always feel like they could do
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got, I got a fridge full of
stuff that I've never released that people
[SPEAKER_01]: are like, dude, let them out, let them
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, I'm just, I'm just not a hundred
percent with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're just tucked away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to ask you sort of an open
question here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mentioned Gelato before,
and obviously you're someone who is known
[SPEAKER_02]: for working with older stuff and,
you know, preserving some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's it like to work with modern hype
stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I haven't worked too much stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the stuff that I'm worked with,
I get more hermaphrodites out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The newer stuff, all the, uh, cookie
stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the Gelato 33 has been my favorite,
um, more, more because of the structure of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows big, uh, super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The buds are really big.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more of the structure of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, uh, this year I'm starting to work
with bringing in that look, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, keep keeping my, keeping my flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I'm going to try to get
mixed the, uh, my first is I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: work a 707 Kush into a, uh, it's a,
it's a Oreos cross to lemon cherry Gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, did, um, and they came from,
uh, obsolete.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a big run of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like most modern stuff, not much
flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, kind of like a doll vanilla flavor,
not much, but it looks incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, is your decision to work with some
of the stuff strategic in the sense of
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, so, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, this cut that I'm starting to work
with, it finishes really, really early
[SPEAKER_01]: outside end of September, um, looks like
indoor, but it lacks flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lacks, it lacks soul really.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has no flavor and not much of a buzz to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my plan is, um, I'm going to
incorporate the 707 Kush, throw a shit ton
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds, pick out the ones that have the
look, but the, the, that OG can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, smoke them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it gets me high goes around to,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and these are, I'm going to just do
fence, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do, uh, and then I'll make
ass ones of them and then all those will
[SPEAKER_01]: probably cross, um, sister plants
together, you know, and then from that,
[SPEAKER_01]: just go forward, get the potency,
get the flavor I want, but have this
[SPEAKER_01]: modern day look.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the plan I'm going to start
doing with everything that I like smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to, first is that the,
um, the 707 Kush, which is the perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: blend of the cam and OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then the next plan is with the
potion, get, get that forbidden fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I didn't, I should have done it,
but, uh, well actually I didn't even have
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant when I was making the lemon tree
ones, but also the lemon in there as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, early on, like in our show,
I talked about breeding and the difference
[SPEAKER_03]: between breeding and seed making.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I've, when I've spoken about you
before on the show, I refer to you as a
[SPEAKER_03]: breeder's breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to illustrate this is
why, because you don't, you don't do
[SPEAKER_03]: things with, with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: No intention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything has a reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an art piece that you're trying to
create.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just, Oh, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to see what happens type thing
with everything, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope everybody tunes in on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, the other thing with that,
um, Oreos lemon cherry gelato,
[SPEAKER_01]: it finished hella early.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I can get the look at having
finished early, but have potency of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of these and the flavor of OGs or,
you know, whatever kind of flavor that's
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what, um, that's what I'm going to
try to work on like this next year or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and they're, they're going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it'll go pretty quick rather
than, you know, like with males,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I try to chase that hype strain by the
time I'm done making it, a thousand other
[SPEAKER_01]: people have already made it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time like I'm happy with release
it, it's, it's, it's already gone down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And moved on to something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, that's why I see all my like the
older strains with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like what you're in outdoor production,
like what you're implying here as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the sense that like, on the one hand,
you're being fashioned forward,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you're also kind of sticking to your
guns and trying to preserve like what you
[SPEAKER_02]: already know to be ideal for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the end, I'm really making seeds just
for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I just got lucky enough to be able to
make a buck off of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I feel really blessed off of it,
but it really, it's like, what,
[SPEAKER_01]: what, what do I need and what's going to
fit my needs is, uh, is something that
[SPEAKER_01]: finishes hell, like an outdoor greenhouse,
more outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking of what usually is I want to
finish, really have the look.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it to fucking taste good and on to
get you really hot is, is the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be able to like grow out a hundred
seeds outside and them all turn out
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly the same, uh, you know,
and especially now with a whole legal
[SPEAKER_01]: market and these commercial guys,
uh, you imagine if they were able to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, not have to worry
about Hermes or nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the plants turned out the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, their, their yield is just,
you know, it'll easily go up 25% to 50% by
[SPEAKER_01]: doing seed and less and less, uh,
and less problems, you know, insects,
[SPEAKER_01]: all that stuff, you know, the seed fucking
does way better than, than a clone does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you have to worry about HLV with
clone and all sorts of other issues too,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I experienced that for the first time this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I got some clones and I really don't
bring in clones too often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I ended up getting kind of folks
this year and, and, uh, the funky and I
[SPEAKER_01]: was like, what the fuck's going on with
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started looking it up and then
send, send everything to the lab and boom,
[SPEAKER_01]: there it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, now I'm freaking out thinking,
Oh my God, it's spread to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, luckily it didn't spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kept on retesting and retesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not everything comes back
negative now, but that was kind of scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, but back in the day, like we never
had powdery mildew in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was, that wasn't a thing at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I didn't even know about that until
like the early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it was actually when Ed Rosenthal
started selling clones and his,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, his, his growth were the ones that
fucking recovered in it and ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: spreading powdery mildew across the world
with the fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's just that easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it like maybe 10 years ago,
the fucking rusted mites and broad mites
[SPEAKER_01]: came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was all brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you got fucking hoplite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or whatever, but that's why you go with
seeds with problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I was reading that the fucking
hoplite and goes into the seed too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've talked about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I interviewed, um, uh, HLV specialist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and she, I was, I was getting real
specific with the questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I wanted to know like, does this
transmit in cannabis at that 8% rate that
[SPEAKER_03]: people keep quoting?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact is they haven't done any
tests.
[SPEAKER_03]: On cannabis and seed transmissions rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're bringing over rates from hops and
just kind of assuming that it's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be the same, but knowing exactly who's
working with duds out there, what clones
[SPEAKER_03]: are dotted and how many of the seed makers
are using them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people are popping those seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't be 8%.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it would be so massive right now
everywhere through seed distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not sure, but yeah, the tests were
hops based, the 8% thing, but it will be
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting to see over time how it turns
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's some scary shit out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm, I'm done bringing in clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, I did get a really good sour diesel
this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was pretty stoked on, and I grew,
uh, that motor breath 15 for the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty stoked on that one too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice division.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Chemo G it's, it's, it's cookies
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it, no, uh, motor breaths.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chem DOG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem DOG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get the chem D flavor comes through and
it's potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But besides, yeah, I'm not bringing it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there, are there any breeders,
are there any breeders out now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, or not even now, like in the past that
you'd like to highlight and say like,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, they did some pretty cool shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they deserve some props spice
alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Readers receive the shit that he did in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, all the, all the stuff that he made in
Switzerland was, was, uh, awesome back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, look good, smell good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, bubble bags just came out around that
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all washed hell good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and everything was consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grow out a pack of seeds and most of
them all fucking turned out how they were
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, his stuff was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the, uh, Shanti Baba stuff back
in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was rude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not a hundred percent sure,
but I, I heard he was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: making seeds for other companies,
like a homegrown fantasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, and he would just,
and, uh, I remember those fantasies too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had enough Gany.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of them came out pretty
consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I never see their stuff at all
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: They used to be a big brand and had a
coffee shop and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you don't see anybody,
nothing in anybody's collections from
[SPEAKER_03]: homegrown fantasy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's anymore kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The end with, uh, with except I've grown
out a lot of the Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not the same as it was in
the nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, uh, yeah, who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, those were the two guys from
back in the day that stood out and then,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I could go on forever and ever with
the people that I was disappointed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to zoom out a bit and ask about
the other kinds of breeding that Shah has
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned, like dog, chicken, rabbit
breeding and like, what has he picked up
[SPEAKER_02]: from there?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, what translates to cannabis
breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it, it's, uh, man, I think it's all
the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, all like all life breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the same, even with people,
it's crazy, but, um, it's, it's all very
[SPEAKER_01]: similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got an idea, like the rabbits,
um, they're meat rabbits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, let's say, uh, one of them has
got a big, big legs, the Heinz,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, but the backstrap isn't as big as it
could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, you know, I would take a male
that has a big backstrap and cross it to
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones with big hind legs or,
uh, you know, with, with dogs,
[SPEAKER_01]: I always go for structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them to look a certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, bullies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the ghetto.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some reason I can't get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, only stocky look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to, you just got to add or
take away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you find, um, opposites,
I find like op cross and opposites are the
[SPEAKER_01]: best unless you got something in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do you want to shrink a dog to hello
small?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you just.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep taking the smallest ones and reading
them together or, uh, but like,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say, uh, for full like hybrid vigor,
uh, I find crossing opposites do the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also like my, myself, I find,
uh, um, like people, uh, I find the most
[SPEAKER_01]: attractive people like the opposite,
uh, black white Chinese white,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's so like, it's all pretty much
the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't matter what you're breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, um, it's all kind of the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Traits, traits, traits, traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the longer I've been into this,
that's the one thing I've realized.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I paid so much attention to the
stories that people would tell about these
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and then try to match up different
things to the stories to see if it held
[SPEAKER_03]: true.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the end, I realized, fuck,
you can just follow traits from the
[SPEAKER_03]: beginning all the way through these lines
and see what the real story is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you really can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have enough experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, uh, I mean, let's just, the,
the lemon tree, for example, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the windy guys says there's no sour
diesel, but inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I was growing them out,
there was definitely, uh, our diesel side
[SPEAKER_01]: of it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can follow the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, same thing with dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, uh, like, you know, when you start
breeding, um, and if you get, if you got a
[SPEAKER_01]: list of the parents and the family tree,
pretty much, you can start pinpointing
[SPEAKER_01]: what, what goes to where and who does
what, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's gotta be fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually never thought about it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's a really interesting kind
of like psychological thing, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: to kind of like deal with all these
possibilities and try to map like possible
[SPEAKER_02]: outcomes, tendencies, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I would say half the time it
works out the other half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I always, I would have these things
envisioned in my head, like crossing
[SPEAKER_01]: different flavors, how it's going to turn
out and this and the other rarely does it
[SPEAKER_01]: ever, uh, like I would say, you know,
50% of the time it actually does maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: from less than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all trial and error at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it all comes down to trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned art before, and I think
there is a distinct analogy there because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's only, there's only so much you can
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can only control like some
portion of it and the rest of it is just,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, charts, various other
parameters, but that whole thing is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is an art, you know, navigating that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I've always felt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's my own world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, even with my dogs,
like when, like people walking by them,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them to be like, Oh, that's one of
fucking Shaw's dogs, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just by how they look is,
uh, is the ultimate goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you, uh, have any thoughts on how
different cannabis breeding, let's see,
[SPEAKER_03]: what does it say different, how different
the cannabis breeding market is now in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2023 compared to when you started the seed
market, how different it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone with a tent can be, uh,
uh, make a seed company now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got Instagram bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I, uh, like I said, I'm, I'm out of
the loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't, I don't really, I'm just kind
of focused on my, in my own head and
[SPEAKER_01]: things that I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really, like, I don't,
I don't know what anybody's really doing
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably the smartest move,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: The least amount of drama is involved when
you keep your head low and out of that and
[SPEAKER_03]: just stick to the art.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate the drama behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just don't even, uh, uh, I'm not in
it ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get the sense that like your life takes
you in many other directions and you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't, you don't need to spend all your
time like in this world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I did the Canada, the Canada
community thing for a long time and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely changed, um, a lot,
uh, the past 10, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, everybody before like,
I mean, now everything's corporate pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much, you know, it's, uh, the handshake,
the handshake and your, your, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: your word doesn't mean shit anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we're back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, that's what fucking made
everything turn was, was a guy's word and
[SPEAKER_01]: their, their handshake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know the whole, the whole
thing has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the seed market, you know,
the seed market, actually there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more people, but probably hasn't really
changed much at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's kind of the same,
like, you know, DJ short stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say, for example, you know,
he came out with blueberry and then all of
[SPEAKER_01]: a sudden, um, bunch of different companies
fucking rebranded his, his blueberry,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I'm sure that all that shit still
goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was saying that that's never going to
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always going to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the shenanigans pretty much always,
always.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a black market, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, even, even in a white market
though, it's just like inherently scumbags
[SPEAKER_03]: are attracted to anything they think makes
money fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate the legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate, I hate corporate and, and,
uh, how people are like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I trust the black market a hundred times
more than I do the legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I trust people in the black market more
than I do people in the legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no honor in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no, uh, everything's a dollar
sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people just look at you with dollars
in their eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's, there's no more community.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no more, you know, um,
helping each other out or anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that said, is there any other work
you'd like to highlight that we didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: touch on that you're working on now or in
the past you'd like to bring some
[SPEAKER_03]: attention to?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on, uh, bringing all like my
favorite smoke stuff into FEMS,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, like my own work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm going to be digging through some
of these blueberry, uh, these,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, um, blue nectar seeds that I got and
start working that heavily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the potions, um, uh, I made those this
summer, which I'm going to start digging
[SPEAKER_01]: through here soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how those turned out, but I'm pretty
excited about those.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some flavors that like I've never
come across in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like just mouthwatering greatness,
fruity, uh, like artificial candy fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: punch, like a fruit punch down later or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what else I got going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, whole bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my hands full.
[SPEAKER_01]: So slowly but surely busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where can people find your work if they
want to get it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm about to actually launch,
uh, uh, my websites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start doing fucking direct
sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love hearing it, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish every breeder would do direct
sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's, it's necessary now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a necessary thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm working on credit card processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually up and running right now,
but it's not working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm just waiting for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to my, uh, credit card application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully here in a week or two,
that should be up and running.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, there's a list of people on
there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can find.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the website?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 707 seedbank.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be exciting here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I got a bunch of like,
uh, bulk seeds, um, that are all great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they just didn't, uh, for some,
one reason or another, like I got a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of like love candy crosses on there that,
uh, like the mom, the moms took over the
[SPEAKER_01]: structure, but they all have the love
candy flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just this Melanie, which they'll do great,
but I didn't feel like anything was
[SPEAKER_01]: improved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I never like release those,
but I was like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do bulk seeds, buck seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, see how they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bunch of other random shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, with that, I want to thank you for,
uh, coming and spending your time with us,
[SPEAKER_03]: dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a real honor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, like I said, like my first,
my first experience knowing who you were
[SPEAKER_03]: was talking to other people that had been
around a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'd be all, you know, every single
story would be, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Shabbat, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, who is this guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I learned more and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the more I learned, the more I
respected you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, I appreciate you taking your time to
talk to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of people have been waiting
for this forever.
