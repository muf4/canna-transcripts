[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_06]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_06]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_06]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm your host Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie
[SPEAKER_06]: Noxodon, Breeder and grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_06]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_06]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome Breeder's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here with my buddy Thousandfold,
and we will be talking about why cookies
[SPEAKER_06]: is the beginning of the end of modern
breeding and maybe some ways that we can
[SPEAKER_06]: change that, hopefully fix that,
and what composes some of these lines and
[SPEAKER_06]: why it's headed the directions it's gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, thank you for joining me
Thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I guess what would make sense
here is if we do a little recap of what
[SPEAKER_02]: the major components of the cookies family
might be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: So first off, I want to talk about what is
cookies itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to talk about cookies, we also have to
talk about another clone that came out
[SPEAKER_06]: around the same time, which was cherry
pie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, animal cookies hit the scene at the
same time, but it's much less relevant.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like more of a thorum cookie
sister.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for all intents and purposes,
we need to talk about which cookies,
[SPEAKER_06]: because there were multiple cookies cuts
from cookie fam that people were growing
[SPEAKER_06]: around the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have the thin mint cut from cookie
fam.
[SPEAKER_06]: My first introduction to cookies was what
was called Girl Scout cookies at the time,
[SPEAKER_06]: but later on became called the forum cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the thin mint cut and the forum cut
are two separate cuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cookie fam has always stated that the thin
mint cut came before the forum cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we refer to cookies in this
episode, we are going to be referring to
[SPEAKER_06]: the thin mint cut proper unless we specify
forum cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the thin mint cut was said to be an OG
Kush that they had from Florida that they
[SPEAKER_06]: refer to as the Flowrida OG, crossed to
what is called the F1 derb, which has been
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of a controversial, really rare cut
that they don't really talk about too
[SPEAKER_06]: much.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't really talk about what's in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when they do, it didn't make a lot of
sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, along that same time,
we have the cherry pie that came out,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is my favorite of most of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might add that in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's supposedly a Granddaddy Purple
crossed to an F1 derb.
[SPEAKER_06]: Granddaddy Purple itself is an Urkel
Salmon Creek Big Bud Hybrid, most likely
[SPEAKER_06]: made by Chris Yockey, who is no longer
around to really ask about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the best knowledge we have for
this moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: But GDP is a very Urkel dominant
expression itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people would confuse the two.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were passed interchangeably for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But cherry pie does a good job of
expressing some of the F1 derb traits and
[SPEAKER_06]: the cherry, or I'm sorry, and the Urkel
traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what you get with cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cherry pie became a lot less important as
cookie fan breeding carried on,
[SPEAKER_06]: though at the time, I'm mentioning it
because it is very integral and often a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of people confuse the genetics in
cookies with the genetics in cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of that, I think, is because
what became known as the forum cut seems
[SPEAKER_06]: to be showing traits from both the cherry
pie and what cookie fan refers to as the
[SPEAKER_06]: thin mint or cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you S1 or have hermed bag seed,
self bag seed of forum cookies,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can find a lot of Urkel traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why that tells me that that is
most likely a hybrid of these two.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that cookie fan probably was right
when they were saying that thin mint came
[SPEAKER_06]: first.
[SPEAKER_06]: In all logic, it kind of works out that
way for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are the main basis for what we're
going to be talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, the F1 derb was kind of a rare
clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Me and CSI have been working with it,
trying to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I worked with it really early on,
made a few crosses and let it go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mostly because there was no interest
really in the F1 derb.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't really talked about a lot by
cookie fans.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it didn't get the hype that all the
others did.
[SPEAKER_02]: As someone who's a little bit far away,
I didn't even know if F1 derb was like a
[SPEAKER_02]: real thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that a lot of people felt that
as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in America, it's the same way.
[SPEAKER_06]: People still argue on Instagram
constantly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when me or CSI post a picture,
they'll be like, that's fake.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not real.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not a real thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been the same cut that's been passed
as F1 derb since the beginning,
[SPEAKER_06]: since we got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we decided that we were going to cross
it to some of these other cuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it the thin mint, we have that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The F1 derb being selfed, so we can see
what other kind of traits are inside the
[SPEAKER_06]: F1 derb.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it is an interesting cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very interesting cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got swollen, bubbly, brax,
a lot like cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of its main traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very low-yielding, a lot like
cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little more airy, like a derban
would be.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has very anise-type smells to it,
which would be like root beer or black
[SPEAKER_06]: licorice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has some gingerbread and some
urine-type smells to it, to be honest,
[SPEAKER_06]: after it cures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it bring the purple-black leaves as
well?
[SPEAKER_06]: It does have some purple traits to it,
especially on the leaves, the stems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Early on in veg, you can see those
beautiful purple traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it does have some nice purple
traits that it brings with it as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure 100% what it is, but
Scentsy's Durban Poison did have that
[SPEAKER_06]: black licorice in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The gingerbread being an extension of
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the pissiness, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would speculate, but it would be going
out on a limb, for sure, that maybe OG was
[SPEAKER_06]: crossed into it very early on,
into the Scentsy Durban Poison Skunk one.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we get with the F1 Durban.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pure speculation, and it's only
because of the bud structure of all of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The smells are very different from OG
Kush.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a long stretch from OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very much speculation, but the small
leaves around the buds, the way they look,
[SPEAKER_06]: are very OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_06]: The resin production reminds me a lot of a
triangle and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I want to go back to Flowrida OG as
well, since that's one of the main
[SPEAKER_06]: components.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been grown side-by-side by Natso,
growing Triangle Kush and Flowrida OG
[SPEAKER_06]: side-by-side, because for a long time,
we were wondering, since both of these
[SPEAKER_06]: cuts are early OG Kush cuts from Florida,
are they the same cut where they just
[SPEAKER_06]: passed under different names?
[SPEAKER_06]: It took a while, but we were able to
rejoin these cuts and have them grown
[SPEAKER_06]: side-by-side.
[SPEAKER_06]: By Natso's opinion, they are not the same
cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are definitely similar types of OGs,
but because of specific traits a triangle
[SPEAKER_06]: has and specific traits the Flowrida has,
which I'll leave that to Natso to talk
[SPEAKER_06]: about in another show, we were able to
tell that they are probably two different
[SPEAKER_06]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes up the basis for what Cookies
is, the directions it breeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I would break it down to GDP Urkel,
Flowrida OG Kush, which is really just an
[SPEAKER_06]: OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_06]: The F1 Derb, which is probably a Durban,
Poison, Skunk 1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's the main components,
if I didn't miss any.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first layer of the inbred
pyramid.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the first layer of the inbred
pyramid.
[SPEAKER_06]: At this layer, I don't see a whole lot
wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see a whole lot wrong with the
direction of breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: When this hit the scene at the time,
when Cookies popped up, I remember looking
[SPEAKER_06]: at the pictures and cherry pie as well
because I saw both at the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, wow, these are absolutely
unique, beautiful plants for their resin
[SPEAKER_06]: production, their bud structure shape,
the bracts, all of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very unique, but I also thought
there's no way this will ever be
[SPEAKER_06]: commercial because it is so low yielding.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I took an interest in it
because I was like, this will never be
[SPEAKER_06]: commercial.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll never catch on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took an interest in breeding with it and
I tried to take it some new novel
[SPEAKER_06]: directions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of just making more of itself,
I wanted to see more of what it could
[SPEAKER_06]: bring to other existing things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the directions I was hoping it
would go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most breeders have taken lines over the
years and cut specifically clone onlys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can talk about maybe why the politics of
that have changed and how the politics of
[SPEAKER_06]: changing enabled this to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: For a long time, feminized seeds were
almost demonized, religiously demonized.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was often told, as were other femme
breeders at the time in the mid-2000s,
[SPEAKER_06]: that we were ruining the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't the way God intended it to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were destroying the chromosome,
so it was permanently going to destroy
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis gene pool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it's just not how it's supposed
to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's trash.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a cheap way to breed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cheating.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were so many different reasons of
why people didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Against God.
[SPEAKER_06]: Against God was a real thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still something that people throw at
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not natural.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can go into why that's the worst
argument out of all of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: In nature, cannabis is naturally intersex.
[SPEAKER_06]: As humans, we've bred away from that
trait, the intersex trait.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've done as best we can to remove that
trait from the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, in nature, it's there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man has removed it by reintroducing
intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're actually taking it back to where
nature had it, technically, if you really
[SPEAKER_06]: want to get technical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting closer to God again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back closer to God.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where we want to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: During those times, it wasn't as proper.
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't want people to know you were
making femme seeds, especially if you
[SPEAKER_06]: were.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas, once we hit to about 2013,
14, 15, femme breeding became real
[SPEAKER_06]: popular.
[SPEAKER_06]: As growing became more popular in America,
and it wasn't just the old legacy growers,
[SPEAKER_06]: and it was getting more popular as states
became online and new growers were popping
[SPEAKER_06]: in, femme seeds weren't a bad thing
necessarily to these customers because
[SPEAKER_06]: they didn't want to deal with males in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_06]: They weren't really concerned about
chromosomes or genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: It hadn't come into play in their brains.
[SPEAKER_06]: The marketing finally started to take hold
on femme seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of that, we started to see a lot
of people making feminized crosses of
[SPEAKER_06]: cookies, including myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: We would do self inbreeding of these
cookies, which is self breeding of cherry
[SPEAKER_06]: pie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we'd make crosses of these and self
these.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it was more allowable and people
weren't getting as much pushback,
[SPEAKER_06]: there were thousands of people doing the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing with cookies and all the
cookies hybrids.
[SPEAKER_06]: They weren't getting the pushback that we
had seen for a decade prior.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this allowed this culture to take
hold of selfing feminized seeds in the US
[SPEAKER_06]: to take hold.
[SPEAKER_06]: In doing so, took breeding in a completely
different direction than it had ever gone
[SPEAKER_06]: before.
[SPEAKER_06]: From there, we have what became known as
the sunset sherbet.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have gelato.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have things like skittles pop up.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have things like this all pop up.
[SPEAKER_06]: The key lime pie.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the next generation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where most of the popularity took the
cookies lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I say that, there are so many
breeders out there who have done unique
[SPEAKER_06]: novel things with cookies when it first
came out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Made crazy, crazy crosses.
[SPEAKER_06]: We even had chocolate tie across the
cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had the 95 centi star across the
cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of strawberry cookies early on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just taking it different directions.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people were more interested in
what they could do in their room with a
[SPEAKER_06]: tent.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we started seeing pop up were the
cookies S1 revolution.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bag seed revolution.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cookies were so in demand.
[SPEAKER_06]: 6,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_06]: People were trying to find any seeds they
could find in the bags of weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cookies did a good job of trying to remove
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: They really tried to pick the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't blame them because they didn't
want the competitors.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when the marketing of fortune
cookies, they called things fortune
[SPEAKER_06]: cookies or fuckies or whatever they wanted
to call it to try to denounce any of the
[SPEAKER_06]: bag seed coming up.
[SPEAKER_06]: People were finding their own bag seeds
and giving it new names.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd name it after themselves cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd call it riot cookies or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was just an example.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also had people that were tangentially
friends with the cookie fam doing some
[SPEAKER_06]: work.
[SPEAKER_06]: In that group, there was a dude named
Mario, also referred to as Sierbinski.
[SPEAKER_06]: He popularized something called sunset
sherbet.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have something he did called
gelato.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of what comprises that stuff is
something he had called the pink panties.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew the pink panties cut for a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to figure out what exactly it
was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Online, there's not a lot of consistency
about what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some say it's a Burmese land race.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Florida OG.
[SPEAKER_06]: I find that hard to believe because a
Burmese land race, Thai, Burmese,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's a 24-weeker and 20 to 24-weeker.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're lucky, maybe work line would be
14 weeks, something like that,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I'm not seeing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just ask how widespread was the pink
panties?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: About like F1 derb.
[SPEAKER_06]: Despite it being in the parental lineage,
because of the people that were buying
[SPEAKER_06]: cookies gear and interested in it,
at this point, I had already walked away.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was not interested much in cookies
proper.
[SPEAKER_06]: People had already made a bunch of crosses
with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was already starting to be inbred.
[SPEAKER_06]: I lost a lot of interest in it,
but I was interested in some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: parentage.
[SPEAKER_06]: The F1 derb and the panties were not
widely passed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, people would have had to have been
into parentage to hunt these cuts and want
[SPEAKER_06]: these cuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look up the parentage for pink
panties, it's not even really consistent.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't imagine there being a lot of hype
about something that sounds like a Burmese
[SPEAKER_06]: land race crossed to an OG.
[SPEAKER_06]: There wouldn't be a lot of interest in
that, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those two were kind of at the limits of
what we know for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at it, I would guess, and because
I've read a few places that Burmese Kush
[SPEAKER_06]: was used or was in the room, that would
fit a lot better with that than a Burmese
[SPEAKER_06]: land race.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, what this looked like was some
sort of blackberry hybrid.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was low potency, a little airy,
not a ton of resin production,
[SPEAKER_06]: a little fruity.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've used it in projects, but it's not
something I would continue to use in
[SPEAKER_06]: projects.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just interested to see how it read.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was something that I know, to see what
else was in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, it's an odd choice to use in a
popular line, nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposedly what's in these lines,
in the Sunset Sherb.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Sunset Sherb supposedly was made in
... I think the area of where he made it
[SPEAKER_06]: was called Sunset Area, which is why it's
called Sunset Sherb.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also something called the Green
Sherb, which is probably what is the mom
[SPEAKER_06]: of Skittles and some sort of cherry pie
hybrid or bag seed, as best we know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was often referred to as Key Lime Pie,
and passed as Key Lime Pie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really cool cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really cool cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really super resinous.
[SPEAKER_06]: More narrow leaf, like Thin Mint,
but just resin and lots of gas,
[SPEAKER_06]: a little bit of citrus, but it's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really nice cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Sunset Sherb was completely different
than the Green Sherb.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure which came first,
but when we refer to Sunset Sherbet,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're not referring to the Green Sherbet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a hard time pronouncing Sherbet,
because it's spelled Sherbet.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no R.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wanted to point that part out.
[SPEAKER_02]: People make a big deal of the fact that
there's no R in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no R in that, why people say
Sherbet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we have the Gelato, which for me is
probably ... Personally, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_06]: is the end of this tale.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the end of the tale of cookies,
the end of the tale of breeding with
[SPEAKER_06]: cookies, at least self-breeding with
cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, Gelato 33 specifically,
that clone, is a fine example of what
[SPEAKER_06]: happens when you inbreed cookies and you
keep trying to inbreed it further.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why I say that is because I've actually
self Gelato 33, the clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you get when you self Gelato 33,
the clone, is Gelato 33.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get a very uniform inbred line of
Gelato 33.
[SPEAKER_06]: For people that know Gelato 33,
it's kind of gassy, depending on how you
[SPEAKER_06]: grow it, kind of gassy, kind of grapey,
good yielding, okay resin production,
[SPEAKER_06]: but not as good as some of the other
Gelatos.
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously better than most cuts,
but the high is very, to most people,
[SPEAKER_06]: is what we would consider very bland,
boring, the 20 minute kind of narcotic,
[SPEAKER_06]: not too unique type high.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I saw when inbreeding Gelato.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, 33, the reason I bring this
up is because if you self the 45 or the
[SPEAKER_06]: 41, you're still going to end up with a
lot of the examples of what 33 looks like
[SPEAKER_06]: by doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it is the most common example of
what you get from selfing the hybrid of
[SPEAKER_06]: Thin Mints and Sunset Sherbet.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like to me, Gelato is the clone
that took hold.
[SPEAKER_06]: The name, what people tended to use,
because you have the Acai Gelato
[SPEAKER_06]: expression, you have the Mochi Gelato
expression.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are all different numbers that I'm
not really super familiar with.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all these little takes that were
supposedly different expressions of
[SPEAKER_06]: Gelato, or even self to bag seed of Gelato
popping up.
[SPEAKER_06]: People have taken hold on these specific
cuts and just keep inbreeding them or
[SPEAKER_06]: crossing them to each other to make more
new name Gelatos.
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, that's what this market is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether they're calling it Gelato,
whether they're calling it Sherb,
[SPEAKER_06]: whether they're calling it any number of
things, it doesn't really matter because
[SPEAKER_06]: that's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why almost every thing you're
looking at looks the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wedding Cake, another one that people talk
about to me, is just what happens when you
[SPEAKER_06]: inbreed OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get a shitload of Wedding Cake,
a very bland, kind of creamy, some say
[SPEAKER_06]: cakey, but I'd say like a creamy,
just bland hash plant type OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very frosty, looks great, little bit of
purple to it, but it's just inbreeding OG
[SPEAKER_06]: Kush over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about Runtz?
[SPEAKER_06]: Runtz supposedly was a Gelato 33 cross to
either a Reverse Skittles or a Gelato 33
[SPEAKER_06]: Hermingham Skittles.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's never really been clearly stated.
[SPEAKER_06]: I made a Gelato 33 Z-Cube, which is a
Skittles VX3 early on.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was some okay stuff in it,
but because there was an outcross in the
[SPEAKER_06]: Z-Cube, it was more variant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Watching what happens when you cross
Gelato 33 to Skittles itself, the clone,
[SPEAKER_06]: ends up being a lot of either Skittles,
which is like Citrus Grapefruit to the
[SPEAKER_06]: extreme, or you get more Gelato and Inbred
Cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Going in that Skittles direction,
you really just get a lot of that Citrus
[SPEAKER_06]: Skittles stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: While it's different than Cookies Proper
and it's a different direction than
[SPEAKER_06]: Gelato, because it's Inbred Cookies still
in a way, even though there were some
[SPEAKER_06]: other outcrosses along the way,
because it's Inbred Cookies still,
[SPEAKER_06]: taking Skittles in further directions into
itself will just beget more Skittles,
[SPEAKER_06]: more uniform versions of Skittles.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you love Skittles, that's awesome,
but if you don't want a bunch of Skittles
[SPEAKER_06]: Terps in every single cross that you make
or outcross, then it's a bad direction to
[SPEAKER_06]: go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Skittles is great for one-off crosses,
but Inbred, it makes it a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting to the summary of what I
think Crybaby mentioned in the chat
[SPEAKER_02]: yesterday, which was, quote unquote,
Cookies gets worse the further down you
[SPEAKER_02]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a paraphrase, I guess, of what you
were just describing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, could you talk to us some about
the FlowRider OG and the triangle and the
[SPEAKER_06]: differences?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we just going to patch this in at some
point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want me to start with the FlowRider
story?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that'd be great, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be about 53 minutes in,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: My experience with the FlowRider is a
little weird in the sense that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: growing a bunch of Super Skunk and Super
Dog hybrids, Maui, Chem Dog, what people
[SPEAKER_01]: call the Chem 91 these days, and things of
that nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was bringing most of it down to the Bay
to a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He unbeknownst to me at this point in the
early 2000s, I really had no idea being
[SPEAKER_01]: stuck in Mendo that there was this like
kush craze that had started in LA,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that people were getting ridiculous
pricing for kushes in LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around spring of 2004, my buddy was like,
I want you to stop growing everything that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing as far as for commercial
sale in California, and I want you to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: this, and I'll take every bit of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can give it to a couple close trusted
friends, but I don't want it to get out,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I want to make sure you give me all of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went down there to the Bay, and I got
this kush cut, and I asked him what it
[SPEAKER_01]: was, and he just said it was kush,
the real kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later on, I found out it ended up being
what people know now as the FlowRider,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I got that in spring, probably April,
May of 2004, and I started growing kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize he was giving me the
exact same number that I was getting for
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize at all that he was
literally getting it for low fours and
[SPEAKER_01]: flipping it for mid sixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was getting jacked, but at the same
point, I felt like the price I was getting
[SPEAKER_01]: was fair because it was comparable with
everything else I was getting,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: How long did it take you to get good at
growing, FlowRider?
[SPEAKER_06]: Kush, at the time, it was new,
and it was kind of hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually wasn't that hard for me to get
good at growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That didn't take any time at all,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did take some time was figuring out
how to get it to yield well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got high quality rips of it right away,
but obviously, most of the other stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that I was growing wasn't necessarily like
a bunch of little golf balls everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to take a different tact into
growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of realized that it didn't yield
very much unless you either A,
[SPEAKER_01]: grew it really close together in high
numbers, or B, topped it a bunch because
[SPEAKER_01]: it was so dense, no matter how many
branches it had, it would kind of throw
[SPEAKER_01]: off golf ball, golf ball, golf ball,
golf ball, golf ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you figured out a way to get a bunch of
branches that got good light, you'd get a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of golf balls and that added up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also seemed like it really liked having
an expansive root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize that it wasn't nearly as
strong of a rooted plant as other things
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grew it hydro, you almost wanted to
grow it on a root mat, something of that
[SPEAKER_01]: nature so that the roots would all
intertwine and grow out into one big
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you grew it in a fluffy peat moss
perlite or cocoa perlite bed, it really
[SPEAKER_01]: liked the roots growing out wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put it in a big pot by itself of
any kind of heavy soil or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, it didn't drink that fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ended up running into issues where it
was difficult to water it as frequently as
[SPEAKER_01]: you might want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And clone, difficult to clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was basically like, that was my
introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our buddy who lives down south,
it turns out that I got things relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: early compared to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at that point in my life, I really
wasn't leaving Mendo or going much south
[SPEAKER_01]: past the bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just didn't realize that there was
this massive boom going on down in
[SPEAKER_01]: Southern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me a couple of years to sort that
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just so happens that the way that
ties into Cookie is that's the cut that
[SPEAKER_01]: all those guys were running.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the cushion.
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you notice in the differences
between Triangle and the Flowrider?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because people always say, oh,
it's just the Triangle cut when they talk
[SPEAKER_06]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: People might get mad at me for saying this
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the Triangle might be one of
the better all-around cushions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think it's the best in any one
area, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does a pretty good job of yielding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a pretty good buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has good flavor and all that type of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think it has the nicest flavor
or the nicest high or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just an all-around winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, that's preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people might be like, oh, dude,
you just don't know how to grow it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know this or that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, to be perfectly honest,
the best tasting cush I ever tried yielded
[SPEAKER_01]: like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a three-quarters of a pound of
light, which I guess when prices were
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy high made sense for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which cut was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that MasterCut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also was dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't very frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't look nearly as nice as other
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't really realize what was going
on as far as.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to sit here and say that I'm
an expert on when exactly Triangle Cush
[SPEAKER_01]: first made it to California.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't realize when I had FlowRider,
it's kind of like the same thing that with
[SPEAKER_01]: the sour was that I thought I had OG Cush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize that there was this
mystery of however many cuts that came out
[SPEAKER_01]: of Florida and then a bunch of S1s and
then all these different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that info that is maybe common to us
now, I had no idea back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the one that I ran for any
number of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was told by that group that it came
direct from Florida to the Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't have any reason to disbelieve
it at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, now that we know way
more than we did back then, I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, you're pretty sure that it's
not Triangle, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, the reason the only reason why
I'm pretty sure it's not Triangle is
[SPEAKER_01]: because years later I wanted to see if it
was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Triangle, because of Ricky,
has a reasonably good like chain of
[SPEAKER_01]: provenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: On it in terms of there are people you can
get it from that can trace how they got it
[SPEAKER_01]: and direct from Ricky bringing it to
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even sending it to California before he
moved here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so I grew it side by side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it similar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, it's what's funny is like when
you were in that era in Southern
[SPEAKER_01]: California, when dispensaries would have
like 25 different kinds of Kush,
[SPEAKER_01]: there were all kind of like variations on
the theme.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like splitting hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, it's not, you know,
not always.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them were more earthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them were a little bit more
lemony.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some of I mean, there was
variations amongst them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't think that they were massive.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of it, too, was was people
growing in totally different methods and
[SPEAKER_06]: that also becoming like, oh, this is a
different cut than yours.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's compare the pictures.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that, you know,
I definitely think, you know, you could
[SPEAKER_01]: come up with differences, but it's kind of
like you know, when you see like a batch
[SPEAKER_01]: of kids or something that obviously came
from the same parents.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got some different features.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like they're twins or anything
like that, but they're definitely all peas
[SPEAKER_01]: from the same pod.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've grown a ton of Kush both due
to interest and due to the fact that it
[SPEAKER_01]: was so popular in California for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but it get and eventually for
me, it gets hard to like keep more than
[SPEAKER_01]: two or three or four of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you sort of you sort of end up
picking the ones that you like for
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're a breeder,
maybe you pick the ones you feel pass on
[SPEAKER_01]: the traits the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're a grower, you probably
pick the ones that you're that you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're your broker or whatever
is happiest with type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so but the main thing with the Flow
Rider is that I got it as OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was supposedly direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Direct from Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the person that gave it to me is the
person that the thin mint accident
[SPEAKER_01]: happened in their room.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just it's just the and you
know, and that and I don't think that
[SPEAKER_01]: happened for, you know, a good four plus
years after I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like because so the Flow Rider was like
was, you know, it just it just so happens
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's it's the same cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, now, the other thing is,
I don't know that I've ever actually
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten a verified that I could be that I
could be totally, you know, sure of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that I've ever gotten like
the first cut that came from Matt Bubba
[SPEAKER_01]: and Josh D that they brought to L.A.
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I can't compare it to that
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think getting verification on that
cut would be damn near impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you talk if you talk to Josh D
or whatever, like he still has the same
[SPEAKER_01]: cut since 96.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of the because of the the
money and the rap and all that other
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe it's alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's probably alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, how would you tell it from one
of the three or four SFB cuts or how would
[SPEAKER_01]: you tell it from this or how would you
tell it from the first go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I mean, there's people
that are like this 92 is guaranteed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this ghost is guaranteed it and this
SFB is guaranteed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you grow those three things next
to each other and they're not the same
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's keep this more to the cookies
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have it's going to the thousand
what you got?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a good moment to bring you in as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Matt obviously has been also like doing
a little recap on the major components of
[SPEAKER_02]: the family.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is probably a good moment to zoom out
and talk about the problem at L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: Large, like going back to that crybaby
quote of it gets worse the further down
[SPEAKER_02]: you go with cookies.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boy, what's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I've kind of given my take a
little bit, but your take is going to be a
[SPEAKER_06]: different and different perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your thoughts on that in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what I think what I think
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically is, I mean, if we wanted to
start at the end, you know, some bag seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: fell out of some buds that their people
were rolling up into making joints and
[SPEAKER_01]: thin mint was found.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just so happens that once that was
found, OK, in the bay out of some weed
[SPEAKER_01]: that came from Mendo, you know,
people's you know, there's people in that
[SPEAKER_01]: group that kind of realize they might have
had something special.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of like cookies was sort
of like, in my opinion, like the birth of
[SPEAKER_01]: the modern weed scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is that like it
was it was kind of around the time that IG
[SPEAKER_01]: was really starting up in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you couldn't smell, you couldn't
taste, you couldn't smoke, but you could
[SPEAKER_01]: see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was visually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you'll remember, Matt,
think about remember how stunning
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry was when those pictures were
first posted on, you know, on the forums
[SPEAKER_01]: probably 10 years before that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the only thing you could see was
visual and visually it was super
[SPEAKER_01]: appealing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have a bunch of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you think the demarcation started
with Instagram and not at the forum stage
[SPEAKER_06]: since both were presenting pictures and
you couldn't smell it?
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there is a clear demarcation of when
things changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because IG came about when everybody
started getting a smartphone in their
hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of being a desktop.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And probably the lack of long form,
like writing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and a lot of those times
there was something, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the forums had already sort of had their
heyday and it's kind of like you had to
[SPEAKER_01]: like search them out and find them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's actually not that much
different than, you know, some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie stuff is like it's also the first
era where for decades, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: people hid their face and hid their
involvement and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And IG was sort of where people got famous
by showing their face.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happened a lot in the forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was a lot of that didn't
really happen on a lot of the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you saw Sam's face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you saw DJ's face,
you know, or you know, the or any any of
[SPEAKER_01]: the people that got, you know,
kind of famous back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like you saw some weed picks maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also because the way how wide the
World Wide Web was back then, you had to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of it was a little bit more niche,
niche.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think it had more to do also like
coinciding with all the states going
[SPEAKER_06]: online and a bunch of new growers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when when Overgrow was going on,
there was when it, you know, when it first
[SPEAKER_01]: started, there was one there was one
medical state.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time IG was popping, there was a
there was it was the whole West Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And times had changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And penalties had gone way down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, really what and this is
this isn't a diss on him, although we were
[SPEAKER_01]: making we were joking earlier,
but like, you know, every, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they they got burner because of his
connections to hip hop and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_01]: and various people he was hustling weed to
to promote cookie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he became cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did because because he was the face
associated with, you know, now did he have
[SPEAKER_01]: did he have anything to do with any of the
accidents or any of the breeding involved
[SPEAKER_01]: before that?
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but we have this seed one through 300
or one through 21 through 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we did about I think only like 15
strains or 15 seeds on this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and the number 20 was just
popping when you plan.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do have that quote from him about
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look, from the very beginning,
OK, like and you can give you can maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: give these guys great credit where,
you know, there's a number of things that
[SPEAKER_01]: happen with cookie one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to remember that at this point,
Southern California, Los Angeles,
[SPEAKER_01]: all that had become very famous and semi
synonymous with Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is just like sports or whatever
else, like, you know, Giants Dodgers or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever and baseball or, you know,
there's regional and especially city
[SPEAKER_01]: rivalries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, cookie was the first like,
you know, cookie was was put the bay on
[SPEAKER_01]: the map.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was found in the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people promoting it were all from the
Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something that everybody in the Bay
Area, which, you know, could which,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, goes kind of from San Jose to
San Francisco to Oakland to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of like a conglomerate of a
bunch of little towns and few cities.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all could get behind it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a factor of like IG and it was
extreme, like because before before
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie, you know, looks weren't really all
that important and we'd as long as it
[SPEAKER_01]: worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookie really ushered in the looks are
incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that and that persists to this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and a lot of breeding post
cookie became what was visually
[SPEAKER_01]: attractive.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what people kind of found to be
visually attractive was things that look
[SPEAKER_06]: like cookies, which it was the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like I mean, what's funny is that
if you look at it visually, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're like, oh, man, it's code.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other part of it is if you have
purplish buds or you have darker buds and
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a bunch of crystal on it,
it makes those that crystal pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it more visually, you know,
and like really dense buds as you and I
[SPEAKER_01]: know often they don't have the same type
of crystal as like sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they don't have as much surface
area for all that crystal to exist on with
[SPEAKER_01]: all the like, you know, I call it hills
and valleys or whatever, but with all the
[SPEAKER_01]: irregularly shaped Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get a perfectly shaped rock hard
nugget, the whole thing looks like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: coated in crystal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it should be really dank.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then because there wasn't
that much of it, it was going for high
[SPEAKER_01]: dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Berner gave it to Wiz Khalifa and
he gave it to other hip hop artists and
[SPEAKER_01]: they started rapping about it and they did
a good job of making it a cultural thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they had a situation where they
had the whole bay behind them because the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole bay had been desperate to like,
I mean, the bay was, has always been a
[SPEAKER_01]: massive conglomerate of weed hustling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's sort of the end point for
where almost all the weed from the
[SPEAKER_01]: triangle flowed down into by the 101.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt, Trinity, Mendo, Sonoma,
all that you get on the 101 and you go to
[SPEAKER_01]: the bay, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was the first thing that the bay
could claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that made a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would imagine so, you know, and you
couldn't smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't, you know, you couldn't see
what was up with it, but you could see it
[SPEAKER_01]: and visually it looked incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think to this day, a lot of people
are still breeding for, um, for looks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so yeah, earlier, Matt said not so
that the first generation, so to speak of
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies work wasn't, wasn't the worst.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, with respect to breeding, but it does
get, seem to get worse quote unquote,
[SPEAKER_02]: once you get to the later generations,
like the gelatos and runs, what is your
[SPEAKER_02]: take on the, that kind of like more recent
part of cookies?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll say this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that made cookie famous were
not the people that made cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the problem is, is that, you know,
the problem with cookie is that the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that ended up getting it and hyping it and
making it work, they essentially had a
[SPEAKER_01]: cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have the parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have the grandparents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookie had been like a conglomeration in
my opinion of accidents that happened over
[SPEAKER_01]: probably a seven to 10 year period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and you know, the story is very
common because, you know, you trace a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of super famous weed back to its origins
and it's bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so whether that's sour diesel or
whether that's Kush or whether that's
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie or whatever, there's bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's different people at
different times that had things that led
[SPEAKER_01]: to one thing led to another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that about cookie that made it
more difficult is that the people
[SPEAKER_01]: involved, in my opinion, did not want
anyone going out there and remaking it
[SPEAKER_01]: better than what they had.
No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for damn sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's money from, from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had no, their interests were in using
this line to get themselves loot,
[SPEAKER_01]: make themselves famous and build a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't trying to do like
constructive breeding per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just meant in the sense that like
they didn't want anyone else out there to
[SPEAKER_01]: recreate it better than they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't want to give anyone credit
before them who might've had a part in
[SPEAKER_01]: making it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a, you have a loose collection
of guys that's involved in different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's trying to make it like this is
their shop.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so the problem with cookie,
like, I mean, I've mentioned, I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was on, I can't remember whose
post it was on, but I kind of view like,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, when animal cookies came
out, animal was kind of like, they took
[SPEAKER_01]: thin mint and they, and they threw it on
Kush, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was cookie, but it was cushy and it
had some potency and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem that they faced is that they
kept, they tried to make a whole family
[SPEAKER_01]: based on one cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they started inbreeding really
strongly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what they did is they made
mistakes in breeding early on because they
[SPEAKER_01]: were just learning about what they were up
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't know how to recover from
those.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would have taken knowing how to
actually breed to recover.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like my main thing was that yes,
people made crosses, but breeding to
[SPEAKER_06]: totally different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you also have to realize too,
that like at the same point in time that
[SPEAKER_01]: this was all going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there was a number of things with
cookie that were, you know, or let's just
[SPEAKER_01]: say components of that we believe are in
cookie over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just happened that were herm
accidents.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that era, before, you know,
pre cookie, everything was still basically
[SPEAKER_01]: males and females.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And herm accidents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they started breeding with
cookies, right, that's, that was sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: the beginning of the reversal era.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I talked a bit about that in the beginning
about how, like during my era,
[SPEAKER_06]: reversals were really looked down on,
but as we got into like the mid to late
[SPEAKER_06]: 2000s, even into like 2013, 14,
because it was a bunch of new growers and
[SPEAKER_06]: spray was available to buy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't as like demonized as it was
during our era.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of people were able to do that
and not get the pushback that we got at
[SPEAKER_06]: the beginning, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and, and so they weren't really
like really what they were doing is they
[SPEAKER_01]: had no interest in, in releasing accurate
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they had interest in is releasing
things that they were going to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of money off the pounds of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were going to control who had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were going to get kickbacks from who
had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were going to build a brand based
off of it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so that is very different from
like our weed nerd of like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, how exactly did it happen?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had zero interest in being like,
Oh, well, you know, it fell into our laps.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't sound as good, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then after it fell into our
laps, we took the thin mint and we started
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a bunch of stuff with that one cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they also had so many different
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the other part of it too is that,
you know, when we talk about they,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different people in the very small circle
that they were in had different bits and
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces of information.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they weren't exactly free to share it
with each other either.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's still competition going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because nobody wanted to get cut out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just like they were all,
it's almost like with a lot of those guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the truth doesn't come out because
it's more like a circular firing squad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody was, if somebody was the like
up and out, you know, it doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_01]: what member and point fingers at that
member and lay out exactly what they did
[SPEAKER_01]: and didn't do, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might even be all true.
[SPEAKER_01]: That person could point at them and
release parts that they're not super
[SPEAKER_01]: enthused about other people knowing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like the mutually assured
destruction that we saw when Dying Breed
[SPEAKER_06]: became Turpogs from Dying Breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just started tearing each other out
publicly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of, you know, and so,
I mean, there's even a situation,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's like, you know,
if I start mentioning names or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, and the hard part about
discussing Cookie, to be frank,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that Cookie now is a big clothing
company and a, you know, a multi-state,
[SPEAKER_01]: an MSO, a multi-state operator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is very intent on when weed goes
fully federally legal, getting bought out
[SPEAKER_01]: by somebody huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's an enormous amount of money
involved in Cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and there's, there's people in
Cookie, you know, that are, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that are a pretty big part of like the
formation of it, but maybe aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: represented nearly as well in terms of
like stock position or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, within the company,
you know, like, Burner had nothing to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with any of it, but, but, you know,
but they picked him.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do what he is very good at.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must've been his looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is promote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, you can, you can't, I mean,
he's good at promoting things.
[SPEAKER_06]: He is very good at promoting.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's good at hyping things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was good at getting the babe to be
behind him because being behind him is
[SPEAKER_01]: being loyal to the bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then as a result of that,
there was other members in Cookie that got
[SPEAKER_01]: angry whenever, I mean, I just have this
running joke that people, when they went
[SPEAKER_01]: to buy Cookie, you know, they bought their
eighth, you know, in the bay of like the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries or whatever, they thought
that like it had been hand watered by
[SPEAKER_01]: Burner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hand selected and watered and manicured.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they, and you know, and they
actually, even they actually gave him the
[SPEAKER_01]: clothing company because they didn't want
him to have the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then they got angry because a clothing
company has way less issues as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: taxes or federal programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden you're making a bunch
of money selling $150 sweatshirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these other people are stuck running,
you know, semi gray area, two 15 era
[SPEAKER_01]: warehouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're making cash, but it's not
like, you know, it's, it's not banked
[SPEAKER_01]: money, like a clothing brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when the money came in,
you know, when the investment capital came
[SPEAKER_01]: in, they wanted a front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man to promote it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like everybody, you know,
like every, everybody sees Burner all over
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's intentional because you don't
want to see the people behind Cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they're you, they're just your
normal old school look.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't even say normal or old.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember two of them were very young and
kind of good looking people, but they just
[SPEAKER_06]: happened to work with the feds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they were put in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, or, you know, they were younger people
that were related to those older people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as a result of that, they had
access to investment capital, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now it's all about like the problem
with cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you talk about Cookie, there's,
there's multiple distinct things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the cookie strain and sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all that, which like is right in our
wheelhouse of like weed history and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that other type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, Cookie today has very little to
do with genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a clothing brand and it's a
series of dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you well know, this isn't any
secret now, but almost all of their
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding is outsourced.
[SPEAKER_06]: I still think that most people that watch
this that are new do not know that part
[SPEAKER_06]: that Cookies proper doesn't make seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have other places that make seeds
white label.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeds that they release under Cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let's put it this way,
because it makes their MSO situation a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: simpler.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even grow weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the wild part.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't, they, they have contracts with
third parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they provide the strains and in some
cases, and they have the right of first
[SPEAKER_01]: refusal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't grow weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookies doesn't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big indoors or greenhouses or outsides or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They contract with farmers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What they control is the clothing line,
the store and the milars milar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, like, you know,
if it, that's how, I mean, that's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: how the runs people did it where it's
like, it's not official unless it's in
[SPEAKER_01]: their milar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so touching weed makes your life a lot
more complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does because that's the federally
illegal part.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the sketchy part.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the, this having a clothing company
and a dispensary where you're just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not, you know, so you're brokering,
you're brokering basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just interject here and share that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is a really good account of
the social, historical, technological,
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial, commercial conditions for the
emergence of cookies, but I kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: to bring it back to the breeding side of
things again and say, another prompt from
[SPEAKER_02]: crybaby was the importance of uniqueness
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Matt, you wanted to raise NO5
haze as a good counter example.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a perfect time for not to delve
into this a little bit more, but a counter
[SPEAKER_06]: example, maybe of a way of a strain or a
project that was across a few things like
[SPEAKER_06]: cookies, but went a completely different
direction and why it went in different
[SPEAKER_06]: direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd say one of the best things,
the best examples for people to learn
[SPEAKER_06]: would be NO5 haze because it was a true F1
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Despite haze being a couple of lines of
different sativa types, generally
[SPEAKER_06]: speaking, what an F1 hybrid is,
is taking two distinctly different
[SPEAKER_06]: genotypes and crossing them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in this case, haze and NO5,
one being an Afghan, one being a typically
[SPEAKER_06]: like equatorial sativa type, crossing
those two brings a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not only that, we found that in real
F1 hybrids, some of the most amazing gold
[SPEAKER_06]: was found.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could talk about some of the NO5 haze,
different cuts and how they brought
[SPEAKER_06]: uniqueness versus what cookies is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've said this before, I think,
but I think that NO5 haze is probably by
[SPEAKER_01]: far the most successful and impactful
commercially available seed line that was
[SPEAKER_01]: ever created.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why did it not end up like cookies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, Neville made the hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was one person that made the
hybrid and he had the parents for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like I said earlier, cookie,
cookie was found in a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that popularized cookie didn't
have the parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it was accidentally made
rather than intentionally made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the other thing, now the other thing,
it's also entirely possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's likely, although it can't be
proven.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think thin mint itself was an S1.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where, as you were mentioning before,
NO5 haze was an F1 of two vastly different
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics coming together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this could, this could also tie
into something else, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we we've talked about before, but bears
repeating.
[SPEAKER_01]: NO5 haze was sort of a, because it was so
wild because it was, it was two totally
[SPEAKER_01]: different things crossed together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a really low floor and a really
high ceiling, which meant that you could
[SPEAKER_01]: find absolute junk all the way to,
I mean, there's still probably eight or 12
[SPEAKER_01]: cuts of NO5 haze that are hoarded that are
30 plus years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's another line out
there where there's as, as many living
[SPEAKER_01]: cuts that are that old that are still kept
because of their value.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the major, major part of that too,
in, in why it differs from cookies,
[SPEAKER_06]: because, you know, like we're talking
about cookies, you know, uh, gelato
[SPEAKER_06]: exists, you know, sherb exists,
all these little different nuances or
[SPEAKER_06]: takes on it, even if they're hybrids.
[SPEAKER_06]: But with the variation and the high floor,
low ceiling, the NO5 haze had,
[SPEAKER_06]: you were seeing variation in breeding
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you could take that NO5 haze
direction, one of those directions,
[SPEAKER_06]: S1 it, and still have tons of variance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe, maybe we should, maybe we
should talk about this for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cookie came about by one bag seed and
then a tiny group of people trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: control its rise and not give people
access to either the information or even
[SPEAKER_01]: the cut to do with what they wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: NO5 haze was totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was people in America that found an
amazing NO5 haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like say in New York or South Florida or
something, and they wouldn't share it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some of those people that they,
that they couldn't get it from those
[SPEAKER_01]: dudes, they just went over to Amsterdam
and they bought the exact same seed line
[SPEAKER_01]: from Neville.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a seven year period,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if cookie came out, and for six or
seven years after that, you could go to
[SPEAKER_01]: the breeder where they found it in and
bought the exact same seed line and hunt
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not exactly sure when NO5 died or
the formula for NO5 haze ended,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it seems like it ended in somewhere in
the mid to late nineties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that literally means that there was a
seven or an eight year period where even
[SPEAKER_01]: if you couldn't get a hold of the cut,
itself because it was held on too tight,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could go buy a hundred or 200 to 300
seeds of the exact same genetics and start
[SPEAKER_01]: hunting it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is how all these phenos started
happening because they weren't all bag
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and F1s off one cut like happened
with cookie, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could go find full sisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there wasn't one small group that
had control over it and was like lying
[SPEAKER_01]: about what the genetics were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could literally go buy the exact same
genetics from the dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's a major difference in
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then obviously if, if NO5 haze is a
full F1 with wide diversity in the line
[SPEAKER_01]: made by a male and a female, like there's
a lot more there's a lot, as you were
[SPEAKER_01]: saying before, there's a lot more
directions you can take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then a potential S1 bag seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And bag seed to bag seeds and bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, where it, it obvious it's a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's now not every bag seed that
created cookies was an S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them were hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but it was just a vastly
different, it's almost like with cookie,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, you know, there was an
intentional breeding in the beginning and
[SPEAKER_01]: then a few years later, something hermed
onto something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that thing got grown for a few
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that thing hermed onto something
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that thing got grown for a few
years and then that thing hermed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they found thin mint out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so it's just, it's just
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as a result of that, you know,
cookie and then, you know, beyond that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even after like NO5 haze,
stopped being a thing for a second in the
[SPEAKER_01]: sense that you couldn't get the exact seed
line within a few years of that happening,
[SPEAKER_01]: mango haze and Neville's haze and super
silver haze all came out and that
[SPEAKER_01]: dominated the scene again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And still to this day, like super silver
haze Jack via amnesia haze dominate that
[SPEAKER_06]: scene to this day, almost like cookies did
over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have like literally kind of bred
amnesia in the same direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like so amnesia is amnesia no matter what
you cross to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you start looking at,
you start looking at Sherb or you start
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at gelato or you start looking at,
at all this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at some point in all of that,
they recross it directly back to the same
[SPEAKER_01]: cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most cookie breeding involves one cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't mean they might not have
outcrossed it, but once they outcross it
[SPEAKER_01]: into something, they typically hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit it back again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the outcross is usually already a
component of what they were crossing
[SPEAKER_06]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happened with, with, you know,
with cookie or like, let's, let's put it
[SPEAKER_01]: this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville, because he had the both parents
and was able to make a massive amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was able to take the line in all kinds
of different directions, cross it to
[SPEAKER_01]: different things and make completely new
lines out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That had their own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where cookie all, all started from
basically like one bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so their, their method was crossing
things back to that same thing because it
[SPEAKER_01]: was popular and they wanted to reiterate
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they also, they also came into it in
a different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they never had the parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have the parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be a good point for me to ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of like a, it's kind of a
slightly different take, but I'd like to
[SPEAKER_02]: hear from both of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were there any positives to come out of
cookies?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like from any part of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what, what do we get in terms of like
lessons or expressions that are still
[SPEAKER_02]: useful and could be worked with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I might have a different
take on this than Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You give me a take.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookies made in the weed world,
at least burner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jiga, Sherbinski, powers up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, everybody basically,
but the guy who the accident happened in
[SPEAKER_01]: his room, they all got extremely famous
within weed world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wealthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time, if you mention those
people to anybody with a decent knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: of, of modern weed history, they know who
you're talking about.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookies create, cookies started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably, you know, turn it that
one cut led to one of the largest current
[SPEAKER_01]: brands in the cannabis space in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_06]: Were you going to say a thousand?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say, so yeah,
it's obviously benefited the individuals
[SPEAKER_02]: involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all the individuals involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookies has a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I won't say his real name,
but Sherbinski has an entire brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically made their careers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since that came out, they've made an
enormous amount of money, marketing,
[SPEAKER_01]: clothing, marketing, you know,
basic hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on top of that, because cookie
got so famous and the look became so
[SPEAKER_01]: popular, Matt can speak to this a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: An enormous amount of, of new breeders
decided I'm going to try to make my own
[SPEAKER_01]: variation on this theme.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for the next decade, at least I
would say 2010 to 2020 easily,
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe even a bit more, the most common
hybrid in cannabis is cookie, some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie crossed to some kind of Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is it charitable take framing of what
you just said that cookies encouraged a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole bunch of people to get into making
seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because, you know, so what I think,
what I think happened there, and this
[SPEAKER_01]: might be a little bit of a tangent,
but you know, it used to be very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very difficult to be an American seed
breeder and have a market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people like say take DNA or somebody
like that Americans who want to start a
[SPEAKER_01]: seed company, they literally up,
they got a bunch of stuff from America and
[SPEAKER_01]: they moved to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt, to throw people off his trail,
uh, wasn't your first website.nl.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted people to think I was a Dutch
company just in case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So IG, not only did IG explode,
you know, uh, cookie in the sense that
[SPEAKER_01]: like, because it was so visually
appealing, it also gave a lot of small
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders a way to access customers,
a way to promote their seeds away for a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of small hobbyists with garages to
create a seed company and then market
[SPEAKER_01]: those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then because in the, in the,
in the 2010s and on two 15 and all these
[SPEAKER_01]: medical places had happened so much,
there was this huge cup era.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of high time starting to throw lots of
cups in California, monthly cups,
[SPEAKER_01]: monthly cups in California, in Colorado
and all these different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then all of a sudden you had a
situation where a lot of these small
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders not only could promote themselves
on IG, but they could buy a booth at one
[SPEAKER_01]: of these cups and it would almost be like
a flea market gray area swap meet where
[SPEAKER_01]: they could get in front of customers and
start selling their packages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Matt and I joke that probably like
95% of today's breeders came up in that
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what are, I wouldn't say 95,
I would say 5%.
[SPEAKER_06]: 95 came up in the environment of IG.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like 95% of new breeders, you know,
like we're, you know, maybe 5% was old
[SPEAKER_01]: schoolers deciding they finally could like
do it a little bit more publicly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not just give it to friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 95% of them were people that were
like, man, I can, I can get on IG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have 5,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have 10,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can announce a drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a way to communicate with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a way to stay a little bit
anonymous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can also get boots and go sell them
directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so part of cookie's popularity was
because since cookie was the most popular
[SPEAKER_01]: thing when this was all going on,
the easiest thing for these new breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: to do was to use cookie in their hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To gain popularity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it almost went hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like if it had happened 10 years
before, it would have been Kush and
[SPEAKER_01]: Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really interesting intersection.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what about you, Matt?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what do you see as possible
positives coming up of cookies?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think like one of the biggest lessons
we have with cookies, like the positive I
[SPEAKER_06]: would take from it is learning that there
is a way where at first it was learning a
[SPEAKER_06]: whole new method of advertising for people
who sold seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to learn to adapt in a whole new
environment in the first place.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that in itself is a good thing because,
you know, in a long, in a business that
[SPEAKER_06]: lasts a long time, you always have to
recreate yourself in some way,
[SPEAKER_06]: shape or form to keep people interested
and to keep your own interest,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cookies taught me a lot about how the
market works and how the market works when
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of money is thrown into an industry
where there was not a ton of money,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially coming from the American side
in the seed world.
[SPEAKER_06]: There wasn't a lot of money put into
marketing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we learned how that works.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also learned how it works when you
take a specific line that is fairly new
[SPEAKER_06]: and run it into the ground 90 ways to
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_06]: And where that kind of takes the whole
market and that people can be convinced
[SPEAKER_06]: that something is new and different,
even though it looks exactly the same as
[SPEAKER_06]: the last thing that was shown.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I don't know if that's necessary for
the better or worse, but any new data
[SPEAKER_06]: points in my mind are good, even if they
are null data points or bad, like negative
[SPEAKER_06]: data points where it's like, it impacts
the scene negatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could make it, I could make a point to
that too, where I could say that I would
[SPEAKER_01]: say in the previous era to cookie,
mostly what drove popularity to a large
[SPEAKER_01]: degree was potency, taste and scent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, especially in like the
sour era, sour could look kind of funky
[SPEAKER_01]: and ugly and stinky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, it could have a lot of
stick, you know, a lot of stent could be
[SPEAKER_01]: stemmy, all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people would crack open the bag and
get a whiff of that nose and look up and
[SPEAKER_01]: say, this will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Kush became popular because it
was very potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a distinctive gassy type nose that
you could sort of roll around in your
[SPEAKER_01]: mouth after you hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, when they first
experienced Kush, they'd smoke it a
[SPEAKER_01]: little, and then they beat, they realized
that the aftertaste, they could sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: like roll around on their tongue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was very potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it got you, it got you more
stoned than a lot of the stuff that was
[SPEAKER_01]: around it at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very cerebral high, you know,
narcotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what cookies did is cookies,
which in my opinion still holds today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today it's, it's about testing and looks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the top two primary
considerations for breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if you compare it to the Barbie
era for women, during a certain era,
[SPEAKER_06]: women kind of changed the way that beauty
looked from the era in the sixties,
[SPEAKER_06]: when Barbie or fifties, when Barbie popped
up, women were expected to kind of have
[SPEAKER_06]: this kind of figure and form and people
got used to seeing this as what beauty is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this kind of impacted what we
became in that cookies had a very specific
[SPEAKER_06]: look.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this became what was beautiful in
cannabis, which didn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_06]: represent the high or any of those other
things, but images, what was important,
[SPEAKER_06]: just like with the Barbie era.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we ended up was this is what most
people's concept of beauty is in weed and
[SPEAKER_06]: what they expect it to look like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Purple, extremely resinous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like lots of resin glands and stocks and,
you know, dense, dense purple nuggetry,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, like that's what people want.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what, yes, well in Bragg's and
that's what people expect out of beauty of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's defined it in a way that it's
very hard to change the market's idea of
[SPEAKER_06]: what real beauty is in cannabis in the
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the other part of it too is that,
you know, it also sort of like brought
[SPEAKER_01]: along a little bit of the primacy of
indoor because most of the cookie stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: was being grown in indoor grows and
warehouses in the Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people would try to take it and like
put it outside or put it in depths or put
[SPEAKER_01]: it in full sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it grew like crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but for someone that was growing
a bunch of two foot tall plants on rock
[SPEAKER_01]: wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think what happened is,
is that because those people were
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in, in branding and marketing,
and all that they were perfectly fine with
[SPEAKER_01]: the look like outpacing the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once they lost the effect,
they didn't really have the skillset
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's not who they were to find
it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's, there was a potential if
things had gone at slightly different way
[SPEAKER_01]: where they probably, they might've been
able to like marry that look with a good
[SPEAKER_01]: effect, but they just lost it early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They lost the effect of Oji Kush,
which was the best, you know, and they,
[SPEAKER_01]: so they lost that effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: The look was easy to find, but once,
you know, as, as anybody knows,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you start picking your winners based on
testing and looks, you'll quickly get to
[SPEAKER_01]: a, like a very kind of bland bud.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is, this is a good moment,
I think to, to say, um, in the last,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the first cookies episode that you two
did, um, you had a little thought
[SPEAKER_02]: experiment that was what can you do with
cookies as a hypothetical breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: project, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what would be cool for now,
um, for today's episode is how would you,
[SPEAKER_02]: what are possible reconstructions of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have very different opinions than
Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Matt can go first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I was going to be reworking
something very purple with lots of stocks
[SPEAKER_06]: that had all oil filled heads,
which to me is super important.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people don't realize that in
the cookie stuff, like it's a lot of,
[SPEAKER_06]: of stocks, but not a lot of oil in the,
in the heads, which is why you don't get
[SPEAKER_06]: super turpy cookie stuff, in my opinion,
like you just don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would choose something that would be
purple.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, as a man that loves purple
myself, I lean towards a potent blueberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: If, if I were going to go this direction,
I would want it turpy, a good Afghani blue
[SPEAKER_06]: type to take that over.
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe, maybe, uh, even in the
direction of, let's say above a blueberry
[SPEAKER_06]: would even be a better direction for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And something that I could take it a
hundred different directions, keep
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding it and out crossing it and not
have the inbred nature, even though
[SPEAKER_06]: blueberry does have some inbred nature to
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would use blue bonnet because I already
know that doesn't and kind of cheat that
[SPEAKER_06]: way and go up and make a, a very dense,
potent purple plant with tons of turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I'd redo it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I knew you were going to say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm going to ask you, what if you
had to do it without the blue?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would probably go, Ooh, I would go
deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would take it to the deep chunk route.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at Naso's face.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know because deep chunk, deep chunk is
not turpy and it's notoriously dominant in
[SPEAKER_06]: what you cross it to.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've also crossed it to things that is
dominated by it only passes its resin
[SPEAKER_06]: production with, with those glands.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would go deep chunk cross to Tom
Hill's haze because I've actually seen it
[SPEAKER_06]: done and it looks like cookies and it's
kind of another cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That entire last minute might've just been
to just to make Tom mad at him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what Tom's work needs is, is,
is to turn it permanently purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what he wants.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what he's after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this his whole career.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could just take his life work and
make it purple for him, he would just fall
[SPEAKER_01]: over and die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I would say, I mean, I'll have a two
part thing to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that because I come from a very
different world than Matt in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the nineties, we would have,
we would have loved cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you're growing gorilla and
you're growing shade grown weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: that doesn't get full sun and you're
hiding it in manzanitas and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, a strain that gets dense,
a strain that doesn't need very much light
[SPEAKER_01]: to get dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cookies is kind of famous for like not
liking sun and not liking food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would, it would like a cookie type
line would be amazing if we ever had to go
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the manzanitas because it would
yield really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It likes being shade grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was people that got cookies
early on that used to like grow tables of
[SPEAKER_01]: something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the outskirts of that table
where there was only partial light,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would load it down with cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it would still yield really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they started getting amazing yields
per light because cookies could kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: grow in half shade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a strain that would do really well like
that and stay short and, and dense up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look really pretty that you could grow
like in not ideal conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would have loved back then as far as
like where, what you could do with it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you recreate it?
[SPEAKER_02]: No recreate.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would be the not not so cookies?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would be the not so cookies?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: How would you make a purple dense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, that could be maybe giving
up some of the, some of the secrets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sauce or whatever of what was in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if you were going to remake
it, you know, the, the idea would be to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to keep it somewhat wide, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean, you know,
you add cushion, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd add some type of Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would try to go with one of the ones
that we think of as like an original Kush,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the flow rider or the TK or you know,
if you could figure out which one was the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual one that Josh D brought out,
just because it wouldn't be necessarily an
[SPEAKER_01]: S one, it would be a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, to expand on that for a
second, a lot of people, when they S one,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of Kush cuts, the Kush cuts that
ended up being nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those S ones kind of looked exactly
like the mother cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because those cuts were already bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you, reverse like one of the
hybrids, say like the T like what CSI did
[SPEAKER_01]: with the TK, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden you get a wide,
a much wider variety of phenotypes that
[SPEAKER_01]: pop out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just the good ones look exactly
like the mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess what I'm saying in a long
winded way is I would try to create,
[SPEAKER_01]: create it without bottlenecking it because
I think that's what ended up happening to
[SPEAKER_01]: it is it got bottlenecked way too early.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cheating.
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you recreate it with without
using the same components?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's hard because I mean, you said,
you know, you, you know, you mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: that you might cross it like, you know,
I can see why you use deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take an adventure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're trying to figure something
short and dense that isn't Kush and isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubba.
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost went purple number one and really
fucked it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean, and then,
you know, you have a situation where like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I mean, it, it kind of has,
it has some, you know, how do you remake
[SPEAKER_01]: it without using Kush, without using any
of like the purple strains that were
[SPEAKER_01]: famous.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't even have to make it smell the
same, but something that would actually,
[SPEAKER_06]: it doesn't even necessarily have to smell,
taste are at the same height because
[SPEAKER_06]: that's not what people even judge cookies
on anyways.
[SPEAKER_06]: And imagery, how would you make something
appear the same?
[SPEAKER_06]: What route would you take without using
the same components?
[SPEAKER_06]: I could hit you upside the head with an
obvious purple right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could use that's a purple Afghan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the thing about it is,
is that, is, you know, if you want it to
[SPEAKER_01]: look the way that it looks, you know,
I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything I think of, I'm like,
oh, it's kind of related to it in some
[SPEAKER_03]: way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, not necessarily, not necessarily
because like assume that it's a purple
Afghan.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is made with what they say it's made
with just Urkel and GDP and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, you know, we there's
actually, I think I'm, I think I had
[SPEAKER_01]: something to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it got like, we broke the robot.
We broke the robot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We broke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We broke the robot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, so I was thinking you'd go Mendo
perps cross to the Maui or something like
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that, but the problem is,
is that, uh, at least when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: certain, certain branches of the family,
I think that that's in there already.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We hadn't talked about that at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: We weren't, they talked about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because that, because the
problem is the seat, the biggest issue
[SPEAKER_01]: with cookie is that because everybody
tries to muddy the waters on what's in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very difficult to get a straight
answer out of any of them, even if you've
[SPEAKER_01]: known some of them a really long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they're going to do is if you,
if you start talking definitively about
[SPEAKER_01]: what you think is in there, they're going
to jump on the parts that they,
[SPEAKER_01]: that might be a little bit off that they
disagree with, that they disagree with and
[SPEAKER_01]: then use that to discredit the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and part of the reason why
Matt's tried to get me to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have been hesitant to, um,
simply because, um, you know, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a branch of cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wants to be a multi-billion dollar
corporation that gets gobbled up by
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody huge and all these people get
payouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really difficult to discuss
cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's that element to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just, you're not just going to
like anger a few people.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I think this whole episode is
going to be that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Matt, and as Matt well knows,
you know, even, even on small people or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I, and when I say small,
I mean, like not smaller compared to like
[SPEAKER_01]: the cookie monolith or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: If Matt, Matt's, you know, a lot of the
reason why Matt gets flack in public is
[SPEAKER_01]: because he out somebody's truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they feel like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it might be true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also affecting their pocket book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way that it doesn't affect their
pocket book is by making everybody know
[SPEAKER_01]: that Matt Wright is a total scumbag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you shouldn't believe anything that
comes out of his mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to discredit the messenger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: At all costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is like 80% of your online
battles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's probably going to be this episode
is going to definitely ignite it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is you saying something that is generally
well known amongst the small group of in
[SPEAKER_01]: the no type people in the cannabis
community, but you know, maybe isn't well
[SPEAKER_01]: known to the larger community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, even though it might be well
known within a few thousand people,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't want the larger can of
community to hear that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then they attack you like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you've seen this recently
yourself, like, oh yeah, it's not,
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes it difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and, and some of these
people have deeper pockets and more
[SPEAKER_06]: political power, or I just have all the
time in the world to be demons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I will say that what's funny about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mentioned it before, but like
literally the person who the thin man
[SPEAKER_01]: accident happened in their room is
probably the least famous cookie person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's probably the least.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can see why, you know, the stories
always come back to this because cookies
[SPEAKER_02]: and a lot of what the industry is going
through as a whole and typifies some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the current inclinations, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the industry for better or worse.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the mystery of strains,
it definitely helps with that because
[SPEAKER_06]: mystery drives sales.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is some mystery to cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there is disagreements between what
it is and what people say it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a thing I posted on my IG
a while back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a New York Walker cartoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were talking about history.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I'm paraphrasing here,
but there's a guy that's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I remember it differently in a way
that paints me in a positive light and
[SPEAKER_01]: gives me the credit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the thing that Matt and I
run into all the time with talking weed
[SPEAKER_01]: history is the vast majority of people in
weed are interested in history.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes them look good and buttresses
their pocketbook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, even with old timers whose
history is decades ago, their interest in
[SPEAKER_01]: the history is how can it benefit me
today, right now and in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you start, you get that you get these
conversations that go on and the first
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation is pretty open and forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next couple, once they
realize that there's some money or some
[SPEAKER_01]: rep to be made, all of a sudden the story
starts changing and people start getting
[SPEAKER_01]: huffy and angry about stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how dare, how dare you bring up that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I contradicted myself a month before on
the episode that we talked about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, this is what I'm currently
promoting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, I could, you know,
do I know the entire story inside and out
[SPEAKER_01]: with, with all details?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, but I'm not even sure the core
people know the entire story inside and
[SPEAKER_01]: out because they all hid, hid parts of it
from one another intentionally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everybody has pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for instance, you know, the guy,
the guy that, you know, the accident
[SPEAKER_01]: happened in, he's been trying to recreate
it using pieces that the other people
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't have or didn't know about.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause different people got brought in at
different times, you know, and as I
[SPEAKER_01]: started talking about the truth and
there's like big brands, that are all
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be all pissed off at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, and, and their investors,
what are their investors want return on
[SPEAKER_01]: their investment ROI, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what are the people want?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, they want to be rich and
famous and have money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Matt and I joke, you know,
but this is very much, this is very much a
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie phenomenon where, you know,
most real breeders are somewhat
[SPEAKER_01]: antisocial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you have a touch of the tism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't like to be that public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, and the cookie era
brought in, uh, weed celebrity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where all of a sudden it became very
important where some of these guys are,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're at an art gallery in LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're flying out to New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're smoking, they're smoking joints
dressed to the nines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're hiring photographers to literally
make them look good and sexy and cool
[SPEAKER_01]: while they're checking out their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know how you afford that,
but yeah, you do that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They turn, they turn going to the garden
into a photo op.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go to their friend's gardens that
they don't even own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look like a photo op that they're checking
on their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Matt, Matt's laughing about it,
but like one of the things that if you
[SPEAKER_01]: start getting photographed in LA and then
San Diego and in New York and flying
[SPEAKER_01]: around and at all these conferences and
doing all this stuff all the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not actually growing to growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very obvious because in order to do a
good job, you are married.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know any of us who are able to
take a vacation for more than two days
[SPEAKER_06]: without freaking out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it just, it's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the life, you know, part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like, it's not, yeah,
it's not like you can't leave ever or like
[SPEAKER_01]: have some friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not like you can't time it
to where like you can get a free week or a
[SPEAKER_01]: free 10 days or something like that here
or there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what happened is, is that a lot of
these guys are the front man.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are the promotion wing of this
conglomerate, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they hire hire out the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that gives them the freedom to be
wearing a cool hat and to catch the smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: going around their face just so as they're
standing outside the club, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're touring, you know,
a lot of times they'll hook up with
[SPEAKER_01]: friends to go tour facilities and never
mention it's not their facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it gives people the sense that
these guys have big things going on all
[SPEAKER_01]: over the place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, girls let, let them put
e-cigarettes in their, in their bum hole
[SPEAKER_06]: and, and make ads out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it just, it's what it,
what it is is that weed really wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: ready for modern marketing techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were extremely susceptible to very
basic modern marketing techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since there wasn't any celebrities,
we were very susceptible to all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of new school celebrities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way that you become a celebrity in
weed, is by being associated or an OG that
[SPEAKER_01]: just so happened to be near some strain
that became famous, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the classic way to become famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oftentimes the person that speaks up
publicly about it becomes the most
[SPEAKER_01]: well-known, even if they just got the cut
relatively early and had nothing to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, going back, think about,
think about like, how, how much,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this might get people,
this might get him mad at me or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like think about how intent Sam Dunkman
was of being on all of the early forums
[SPEAKER_01]: and battling so that his view on what
happened was the view.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't like there was four or five
other dudes that were all there that were
[SPEAKER_01]: competing with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So eventually when you repeat something
like that over and over and over and over
[SPEAKER_01]: again, it gets pushed into the fabric of
the tail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very hard to dislodge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a turd in a punch bowl.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just keeps popping back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and, and so, you know what,
you know, but it, it's one of those things
[SPEAKER_01]: where now back then he didn't show his
face and he would have different monikers
[SPEAKER_01]: on different, on, on different forums.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everybody knew, you know, you know,
not everybody we knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I mean, that's what we were
talking about it earlier, but like,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of stuff that's fairly
common knowledge within a very,
[SPEAKER_01]: a relatively small group of weed insiders
that the public is totally ignorant of.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's, that's kind of why I wanted to
do this episode today, because like a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of the people coming in don't understand
why we have the take on cookies being just
[SPEAKER_06]: inbred garbage and why, like when new seed
makers, and I definitely specify the
[SPEAKER_06]: difference between breeders and seed
makers, cause there's a major difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: When new seed makers like come to me and
they're like, Hey, check out this fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: forum cross to OG I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is breaking.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to break new ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just don't have a good response for
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes I'm just like, man,
maybe you should try something different
[SPEAKER_06]: because that's been done a hundred ways to
Sunday and they don't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't, you know, I get hesitant
to mention names on here because
[SPEAKER_01]: inevitably like it'll be a 15 second clip
that gets cut out and the person will be
[SPEAKER_01]: all angry, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, being that cookies and Kush has
been blended by lots and lots and lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: different people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very unlikely that by blending these
things, you're going to come up with
[SPEAKER_01]: something truly new and unique.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have this running joke on the discord
where like, you know, we'll post pictures
[SPEAKER_01]: of that new new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like the same ultra dense
frosted purple ish cookie type weed that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been seeing for the better part of
the last 14 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, to me, it doesn't matter if you
call it jealousy, if you call it cookies,
[SPEAKER_06]: if you call it whatever cheetah piss,
whatever name they have for it today,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's always some form of inbred in crossed
cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe with a single out cross somewhere in
there to try to give it that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'll, I'll throw something else
out there for a second, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe this is controversial or
whatnot, but I actually respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Burner and cookie, um, going to going and
trying to work with our buddy body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason is that, that I is because that
stuff is long overdue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For someone to take it and to take it in a
totally different direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've already done the seed junkie.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've already done the, the,
the, the, the Chris compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've already done as many variations on
the theme as you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have other breeders out there
being like, I'm going to cross cherry pie
[SPEAKER_01]: to Kush, but not this Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, like, I mean,
they didn't really do it, but like,
[SPEAKER_01]: really what, what, you know, what cookies
needs is like, they can be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Bodhi cross it to this weird
Cambodian you have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it away different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what we want out of this cookie?
[SPEAKER_01]: We want the cookie to like bring down the
flowering time and add some density to
[SPEAKER_01]: this larpy ass bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: And take it from 18 weeks to 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookie needs to go in a totally different
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if that direction is risky.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you think that the corporation
itself has actually recognized this
[SPEAKER_02]: properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the problem that they faced is that,
is, is that Bodhi and cookie are such
[SPEAKER_01]: different pieces of the, of the canapai
that both fan bases were sort of insulted
[SPEAKER_01]: that the other one worked with the other
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it didn't go over well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as soon as they announced the,
as soon as they announced the shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: like our homie got mad flack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Burner had to turn off comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was basically like,
you know, Luke Skywalker being like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a bond with the empire,
but I'm not going to try to change them at
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to try to like save my dad
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just really like, like they've won.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I might as well hitch my horse to that
Giddy and go with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it didn't go over very well,
but you know, it's like, if you want
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's not same, same,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's almost like if I wanted to
take it like in a musical direction,
[SPEAKER_01]: what cookie needs is cookie needs to go in
a totally different genre direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like think about like every music thing,
something comes out with music that's new
[SPEAKER_01]: and unique fast forward 10 or 15 years,
and there's a million bands making slight
[SPEAKER_01]: variations on the same theme.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not new.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same well-traveled shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just trying to extract more money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually the kids are like,
this is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they move on to something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they make dubstep and ruin it
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, if you, if you, if you want
to look at it, and I don't know if I've
[SPEAKER_01]: used, I've used this example a bunch
privately, but I think one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: important bands in America and like in my
lifetime in America was Nirvana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, check it out, dude,
because I'm a little bit older than you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot older before Nirvana came out,
everything in pop pop, everything in rock
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything on the radio and everything
on MTV was poison, Def Leppard,
[SPEAKER_01]: warrant, winger, enough's enough,
hair bands out the wazoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was all it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cinderella, you know, Bon Jovi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like great white shark striper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Winger, warrant, you know, and they're all
variations on the same theme.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Nirvana comes out and every
single one of those motherfuckers lost
[SPEAKER_01]: their job except for Bon Jovi and maybe
one other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They literally like Guns N' Roses and Bon
Jovi survived.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody else died.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were like, this isn't cool anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: Motley Crue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't forget Motley Crue.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did survive some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Motley Crue survived.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm saying is it went from
literally dozens upon dozens of bands that
[SPEAKER_01]: were basically variations on the same
theme to two or three surviving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the entire nineties post Nirvana was
different musically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can not like them, but it was like
after Nirvana, every music executive went
[SPEAKER_01]: to Seattle and signed every single band
they could find.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everything after sounded like Eddie
Vedder.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like because they realized that like the
mood had shifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You weren't going to be able to get a big
hair band in acid wash jeans and an entire
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle of Aquanet playing a huge heart
shaped guitar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would have a rocking tune and then
a power ballad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like that formula was done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They needed a new formula.
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of new formulas, I wanted to get
into this before we like totally forget
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see how I bring it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but hold just one second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me let me just finish that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what cookies needs, OK, is cookies
absolutely needs to step out of its
[SPEAKER_01]: comfort zone and be like, what are the
qualities in this weed that we could add
[SPEAKER_01]: on to totally different weed that would
then be the sum of its parts because or
[SPEAKER_01]: better than the sum of its parts,
because for the last 14 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: they've been inbreeding and trying to
create various variations on the same
[SPEAKER_01]: theme.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's all cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all runs, which is cookies and
gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all just it's all the same incestuous
family.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a million different names attached to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to fade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what people need to do is they need to
take the useful parts of cookie and be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, genetically, what can we add?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like because cookies is so dense,
maybe we can add it to like some really
[SPEAKER_01]: larfy stuff and like solidify it a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can add it to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can do this with it like they
need to step out of their box.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to be able to keep just
rebranding the same weed for the next 20
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly when people are going
to move on from cookie, but they will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they've moved on from every other
fad or phase that we've ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, imagine if imagine if like we were
still listening to warrant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, some people do.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like but most people listen to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like that's what they were listening
to when they were in their teens and their
[SPEAKER_01]: 20s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just reminds them of their youth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like that's kind of how music goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes like, you know, like it becomes
for old people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the new kids into?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So taking that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You and CSI have been working on some
things, and some of them, some of them
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been working on with, like the F1
Derb stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been trying to go in and figure out
some things with the F1 Derb because it
[SPEAKER_06]: was so lauded by some.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then some just basically said it
didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_06]: We wanted to see what happens when you
frost this to your Flowrida OG cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he took that and you guys crossed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to see what comes from
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have the 56 day headband cut
cross.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cross to the F1 Derb to see how that
direction goes with some kind of headband
[SPEAKER_06]: derb.
[SPEAKER_06]: But mainly with you and CSI, you had given
him your your L.A.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kush headband cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've talked about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think there's a whole episode
maybe even on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you want to talk about some of
these crosses and how it will cross to say
[SPEAKER_06]: the Bubba Kush, the different Tams,
the Bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you take a second to go over a few of
these?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just so just so people know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been sharing some of my, you know,
CSI is so prolific that I've been sharing
[SPEAKER_01]: some of my cuts with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've been doing some,
you know, some intentional breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just like with every other
breeding, you throw in some other stuff in
[SPEAKER_01]: there that you think will work well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so it's it's a mix of like,
you know, making some cool seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's also a mix of of like,
well, I wonder can we recreate certain
[SPEAKER_01]: things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as people as people know or don't know
the 56, which a lot of people don't call
[SPEAKER_01]: it that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people just call it straight
headband or the murder cat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was made by somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I despise that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but it's basic story is that when Kush
was really tightly controlled and worth a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of money and so cow, there was this
cut and there was because it was worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was worth so much money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: is L.A., there was some violence around
this cut and it ended up going to the Bay
[SPEAKER_01]: and they wanted to like work with it in
the Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they didn't want to bring a bunch of
heat that was occurring in Southern
[SPEAKER_01]: California up to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they decided to rename it headband to
throw people off the trail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people called it the 56 because it
was done in roughly eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's kind of one of those cuts
that a lot of people know as headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it was it was one of you
know, now you ask different people,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what it is and they'll be like,
oh, well, it was the Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why people get so upset.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that while it doesn't have my
favorite Kush flavor, it is by far the
[SPEAKER_01]: most potent Kush cut I know of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got it in 06.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other people that have it that got
it from basically the same crew,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's floated around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different people call it different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of Matt's buddies has it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few other people that have had
it and worked with it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is it is a really good,
extremely potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people find it too potent to smoke,
which I know sounds like a lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has this thing which is strange for an
indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Matt experiences this sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives people extreme anxiety.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I call it the fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fucking, you know, it gets people high
enough that they get nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, the so we have that that was
crossed the F1 Derb.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the Flowrider OG crossed to the F1
Derb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are basically what that is,
is that, you know, since the Flowrider,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know for sure it's the it's the Kush and
Cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because of when and who I got it
from and what happened after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Flowrider crossed the F1 Derb is
sort of like an attempt to like mix some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the some of the earlier generations of
strains that led to Cookie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's not the exact the claimed
generation, the claimed lineage to see if
[SPEAKER_06]: it really pans out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, or it's you know, it's it's a
little bit more it's an attempt to do some
[SPEAKER_01]: intentional work where you get a where you
get a chunk of seeds that isn't just like
[SPEAKER_01]: one bag seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's it's a way to look at.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know CSI argues me on this all the time,
but really it is a way to check out the
[SPEAKER_06]: parentage, whether you like it or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see the expressions and traits of
parents in those lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: So technically you can see what the
sisters and brothers would look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so I will say that, you know,
I mean, I could I could explain some of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The F1 Derb is is the way that it was
named and what it is and how it all works
[SPEAKER_01]: is it's been created intentionally
mysterious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it was kind of the secret sauce that
they didn't really want to let out what
[SPEAKER_01]: was part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, that could be a way to
get some cookie like stuff there and and
[SPEAKER_01]: see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, now what's cool about the F1
Derb is that it has color and it has
[SPEAKER_01]: turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has unusual stuff like that going
on, hopefully by crossing it to the to the
[SPEAKER_01]: float to the flow rider and to the 56,
you'd get some potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and some of that, like,
ding, ding, ding, ding, ding classic look
[SPEAKER_01]: to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll we'll see what happens with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 56 is at the very least a very early
or the or one of the earliest push cuts to
[SPEAKER_01]: come out of L.A.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the flow rider is, you know,
it's it's it's another one of my favorites
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's another early one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it and it's it's definitely the one in
cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: How about your your L.A.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cush, Bubba Cush, the headband?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the L.A., like I've I've talked
about it intensely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my favorite diesel cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what the bubble would probably add is
it would probably shorten up the flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times some of these hybrids that
people are running of the L.A.,
[SPEAKER_01]: they they can run 10, 11, 12, 13 weeks
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by crossing it to Bubba,
you're crossing it to something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would hopefully maybe add a little
density, maybe shorten the the flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both cuts are pretty potent in
different ways on their own.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have we have one that we've seen quite
a bit of, which is the Indiana bubble gum
[SPEAKER_01]: reversed onto your L.A.
Cush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, the Indiana bubble gum,
it's kind of a weird one in the sense that
[SPEAKER_01]: it smells strongly of bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say it's pretty fair to say
that the taste doesn't translate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the hybrids tend to not be as pink
bubble gummy, depending on what you cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the main thing about the bubble gum
that's really nice is it seems to be it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a really good indoor and outdoor plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extremely resistant to mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just the way that it stacks nugs on
itself and the way that it it's structured
[SPEAKER_01]: structure, it's it's both in branching and
buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as a production plant goes,
it's a it's a big winner.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a killer production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so hopefully what it would do is it
would make the L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit more into a production plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you would get some of those turps and
some of that weird zippy high that comes
[SPEAKER_01]: along with the the L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So then we get into let's let's just put
these all in one kind of category.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or even those three different cuts that
may not even be sisters.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chem D, Chem number one and the dog,
Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll start with D because it's been
thrown out a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes me happy that a lot of a lot of
people have tagged me and stuff or sent me
[SPEAKER_01]: or sent me tales or pictures of their
experiences with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there are two of my favorite cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like it produces a whole
bunch of gassy, highly potent plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: have a decent amount of variety within.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, you know, I would say turps,
you know, gas gassy type, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhat a little bit skunky turps tend to
come out quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And potency seems to be very common to
find, which isn't surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're two of my favorite smokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that one we've seen actually quite
a bit of and I'm pretty stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about the Chem one?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Chem one curious about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people would find interesting
because it's by far the least circulated
[SPEAKER_01]: surviving chem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never went very far.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a 12 to 13 week, very sativa looking
[SPEAKER_01]: long spheres, big spheres, chunky,
takes a long time, 12, 13 weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by crossing it to the L.A.,
which also takes anywhere from 10 to 11
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks easily, you're probably going to get
a big, stretchy, long flowering plant with
[SPEAKER_01]: a good amount of potency.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it's it's most people don't
get to try the Chem one very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of uncirculated to a large
degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so that's kind of that one,
I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the dog, 91 Chem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the dog is pretty famous for
making things look like itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would expect some phenos that look
dog like to some degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also is one of the most consistent
things that passes potency.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: is is is probably in my top five as far as
potent effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one, I can't I can't easily
imagine this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and but they have very different potent
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of has like this zippy, somewhat
uncomfortable, like sometimes confusing or
[SPEAKER_01]: slightly nervous buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the 91 has like a very warm
relaxing, energetic buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see how that one combines.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mendo perps cross to your headband.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, this is a very not so cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is very I mean, both of those things
I've had for a couple of decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're two crosses of two of my oldest
oldest longest held things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would expect that one would be extremely
variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mendo perps itself has a very wide
variation even within the s ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would expect a wide variety of
colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: What Mendo perps has in spades is terpenes
of a wide variety of types and a wide
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of different colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: has potency and is very diesel like.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would also add that there is a good
chance if you grow out enough of these
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds that you can find what people would
classify as skunk skunk because inside the
[SPEAKER_06]: Mendo perps s ones at about a 10 percent
range, that expression is in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's skunk at about a 10 percent range.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's skunk and cushiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mendo P. Out of anything we've
mentioned so far, I think that one might
[SPEAKER_01]: have the widest range of phenotypes,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But within it, you could probably find
some real gems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Obama Kush, a famous cut up in Oregon and
Humboldt area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obama Kush is Bubba Kush by Mendo P. Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it probably won't be as crazy wide as
the thing we just talked about,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it'll probably do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's it's you could probably
take my comments about L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: by by Bubba and L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: by Purple and sort of combine them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it in itself is a high hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would expect, you know, the Bubba kind
of breeds like Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, but boy, there's a lot
of purple Bubba diesel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple Bubba diesel would be a good way to
look at it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the crazy thing about Mendo perps,
I will say, is that it's not just perps.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you grow out the s ones, you see
everything from black to purple to
[SPEAKER_01]: lavender to burgundy.
[SPEAKER_01]: To green.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a lot of different, you know,
like when I see burgundy, there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that are straight red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like very red.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who knows what kind of looks could get
mixed into there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the last but not least, certainly not
least, is the the headband triangle,
[SPEAKER_06]: which has also been grown out of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I spoke a lot of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I people have sent me stuff of that,
you know, not not like I don't think I've
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten any actual samples, but pictures
and various things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a super sour OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's you know, it's that's basically going
to be like a, you know, a sour Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a way, you know, but it's probably a
sour Kush that's made out of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the triangle has kind of a wider genetic
base than a lot of Kush's do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: is probably a different sour than most
people are used to smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's probably a different take on those
flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like sour OGs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I put those up there with blueberry is is
probably my top favorite smokes of
[SPEAKER_06]: something I get smoke all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tend granted sour and OG combined in
many different ways, but I tend to like
[SPEAKER_06]: most sour OGs that I've come across as far
as the heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's two of the, you know,
the it's the two lines that were the most
[SPEAKER_01]: famous in terms of like fads prior to
cookie, probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sour and the and the OG era.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of overlapped.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were, you know, who knows how many
different hybrids we would have gotten of
[SPEAKER_01]: all that stuff if it would have been
during the prime of the reversal era.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because it's prime was a little
bit before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't mean it still didn't happen on
occasion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but but but, you know,
on this note, I was curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you all talked about the 56 day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that one hard to reverse?
[SPEAKER_02]: And would it be interesting to see the L
.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: and the 56?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All OGs are hard to reverse and all these
are hard to reverse.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just is like pure OGs, OG types that
are very lanky.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's why that's why
thousandfold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see on the market a bunch of
diesel type S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because often it fails or people
don't get what they consider to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: sellable amount of seed commercially
viable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so it's like they're like,
oh, I went through this whole effort to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it and I got 200 seeds and I actually
don't want to sell any of them because I
[SPEAKER_01]: just went through all that effort and I
want to see what's in them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you wanted to sell them to make your
money back, you'd have to sell them at
[SPEAKER_01]: five hundred a pack and people just slip
when you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, a lot of times I'll
interject this to what also drove a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the early reversal seed sales when the
thing boomed, like I was talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe an hour ago on the show,
is people couldn't get a hold of certain
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie cuts or the Skittles cuts or this
cut or that cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so people were able to reverse
them and sell S1s and sell hybrids and
[SPEAKER_01]: sell them for a lot per pack because it
was the only way you could get access to
[SPEAKER_01]: the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, think about like when think about
Matt, when Dying Breed first was selling
[SPEAKER_01]: at EC and nobody could get a hold of
Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, they were selling literally
everything that they could cross the
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles for three to five hundred,
three to six hundred a pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they wouldn't have been able to do
that if people would have been able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the cut itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so it's like.
[SPEAKER_02]: He talked enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say I only brought it up
because I think you were in the chat
[SPEAKER_02]: yesterday as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so when someone was like, oh,
why have it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why isn't there like an L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: sour?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I think historically those two
have not been able to be reversed for,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, I mean, even like take CSI,
all the all the seeds of TK that he sold
[SPEAKER_01]: were his third try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He completely failed the first two times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even the third try was a failure by
his standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got about 10 percent, maybe 15 percent
of the amount of seeds that he would
[SPEAKER_01]: normally want to get from a project like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now one thing I keep pointing out and
I want to want to stress on this was that
[SPEAKER_06]: these projects that you guys worked on,
they weren't they weren't done all at
[SPEAKER_06]: once.
[SPEAKER_06]: Each of those reversals was done
individually at different spots.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a project done over years and
lots of space and lots of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just like a hit him one and done
project.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's there's a lot of time and energy put
into this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So mad props on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm stoked we're finally able able to
make it available.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to start the drop on
Friday at four p.m.
[SPEAKER_06]: for Patreon Pacific and on June 23rd.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for everyone else, eight p.m.
[SPEAKER_06]: if there's anything left because they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say one more thing, too, is when it
comes to breeding, breeding projects that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm involved in, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that I lean much more towards
things that interest me or things that I
[SPEAKER_01]: think people might be able to take into an
interesting direction rather than like
[SPEAKER_01]: what's very popular in the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think might just sell out really
fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as a result of that, you know,
like I'm always looking for stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: people could take in a new and different
direction and especially mostly the
[SPEAKER_01]: primary thing is like hopefully stuff that
people will like the smoke.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Effect the effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you have any problems with
this drop with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, definitely not.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anything else we wanted to get in
that we had written down thousand or is
[SPEAKER_06]: this a wrap?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think we are more or less there.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anything else you wanted to get
in?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not so it's been a few weeks since we've
had you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Glad to see you again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, but we are going to put him back
in until we reach 10 K.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to see him and keep seeing
him, subscribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it is I will say that,
you know, it is one of the things about
[SPEAKER_01]: doing content that Matt and I have learned
is that when you start doing weekly
[SPEAKER_01]: content like anything else, it's a grind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're trying, you know, you know,
it's like you've got X amount of subjects
[SPEAKER_01]: you find interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get into this mode of like,
well, what do people want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do people want to hear about?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's new?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, talking how we talk about
Canada history and trying to bring out
[SPEAKER_01]: truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it causes ripples in the force.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I, Matt has, you know,
I generally speaking, avoid most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: ripples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt is the one that gets crashed by the
waves, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did some stuff recently where I
bore the full brunt of said ripples.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's not as easy or
painless even to talk about all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different subjects.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a wider amount of people out there
who just want to hear truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, or they want to hear versions of
stories or this or that or whatever else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt and I think it's really important to
get that kind of stuff out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're always dancing this line about
like, you know, what's public,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's private, what's appropriate to be
said, you know, what history is pertinent
[SPEAKER_01]: and what's more salacious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get people that want to just
drive the narrative in a way that is what
[SPEAKER_01]: we consider to be inaccurate, but benefits
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we fight against pushback.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, we appreciate you both
very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think over time it becomes more and
more obvious to people just how complex
[SPEAKER_02]: and scary some of these politics can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I will say in addition to that is
that for all the bull, it does make me
[SPEAKER_01]: think that some of what we say matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that we are having an impact on people
and that people are nervous about our
[SPEAKER_01]: impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because if it was, if we were
totally irrelevant, it wouldn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just be words in the wind.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, and we're growing and growing big
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, it's, it's just,
you know, it's, it's, it's, it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: like, what's funny about it is that I'm a
naturally diplomatic person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like, people get mad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people get real mad at me about
certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, man, what if I just wanted
this, just vented it all out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I learned a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people think I'm just completely
unfiltered and just say everything that we
[SPEAKER_01]: discuss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is it on so much?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this pertinent to the story?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it fair?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it okay to let that out?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like, does this person deserve
to be air hold, even though they're
[SPEAKER_06]: probably good people and, you know,
maybe lied about a few things like all
[SPEAKER_06]: these things go into account and we don't
just air hole everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's, it's like really,
you know, and it also is, it's also a
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult time in weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for people like Matt and myself who
have dedicated basically their entire
[SPEAKER_01]: adult life to this, this, this subculture,
there's been a lot of rapid changes
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of good people in Kana
right now who are looking around,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to figure out how do I fit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do I fit?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I navigate this weird new place?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you guys are holding up,
you know, a beacon and it's.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is a wrap.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, um, not so thank you for,
for coming and joining us on, on quick
[SPEAKER_06]: notice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with that, I just have one,
one quote from cookie fam that I think
[SPEAKER_06]: deserves to.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with that, it's a wrap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you everyone for joining us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be sure to check out the drop is in our
Patreon discord.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to get in early on the drop,
um, cause there might not be nothing left.
[SPEAKER_06]: After that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was double negatives,
but I mean it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, yeah, thank you thousand for,
for helping us scoot this along and keep
[SPEAKER_06]: it on track.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause we are so ADHD tangent prone.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this has a ton of help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an honor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, Matt treated me with kid gloves
today because he didn't mention any weird
[SPEAKER_01]: truck stop humor, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to, you know, he's like,
you know, not so it's been gone for a few
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be kind, you know,
I'm sure they've been building up inside
[SPEAKER_01]: of him, you know, like, and he had
probably had to bite his tongue multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: times during this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just letting you feel safe,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm letting you feel safe before,
before the trap snaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
