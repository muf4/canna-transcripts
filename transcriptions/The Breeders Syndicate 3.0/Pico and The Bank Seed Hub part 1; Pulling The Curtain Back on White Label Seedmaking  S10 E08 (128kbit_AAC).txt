[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_02]: counterculture that is Canna.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_02]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be joined by members of the Canna
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_02]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_02]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our mission is to combat the narrative of
the corporate cannabis industry when seed
[SPEAKER_02]: posers are obfuscating for their own
financial benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, here with our co-host
Thousandfold, and today we're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: talking to Patrick Pico.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been a good friend of mine since I
think we first met at Emerald Cup 2017 in
[SPEAKER_02]: person, and ever since we stayed in
contact.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a fascinating tale through the
seed world and a lot of experience in the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed world, making seeds at scale and
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thousand, you want to kick it off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess first I wanted to ask
everyone how their week has been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was the new year?
[SPEAKER_00]: New year was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Family man, so super mellow, which I'm
grateful for because otherwise I'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling like shit right now and every day
since the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did absolutely nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the slower pace these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really gratifying, so it's been a
great week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they celebrate new year?
[SPEAKER_02]: New years in Kenya, where you're from,
Thousand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's traditional to just stay up
late and watch cartoons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And watch the balls drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it sounded like chaos, like straight
up Vietnam, where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our city is very conservative,
so fireworks have always been really big
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's never really been any pushback
on fireworks, despite it being desert and
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of brush and things catching on fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it was they were they were
lighting off boom booms loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to say that word.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom booms loud enough to shake windows
like a mile around setting off all the
[SPEAKER_02]: car.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my big old Anatolian Shepherd was on my
lap the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it is usually never fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens when you get old,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have a whole bunch of fireworks out
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They allow those there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That does surprise me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bit of a wish climate, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably not as risky as it is for
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, you know, do they allow like
bottle rockets and like firecrackers or is
[SPEAKER_01]: it just like the safe ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the safe ones, I think, relatively.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's weird where we're at in
California, too, because like they import
[SPEAKER_02]: like you just go over the border over to
Nevada and people bring back like M80s and
[SPEAKER_02]: like big old monster things and like
there's no way to really rationalize like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, that legality, because especially
with online now, anybody can get anything
[SPEAKER_02]: anytime, anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really opened up that market,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like you guys were talking about
earlier before we started recording,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mostly feel sorry for all the animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to put up with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even even veterans with PTSD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that that was something I hadn't
really considered until later in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like, especially after the
Iraq war and the Afghanistan war and the
[SPEAKER_02]: guys come back, like that stuff isn't a
joke to some of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really affects them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, people need to take more
consideration to that if they really do
[SPEAKER_02]: care about the troops and all that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I thought maybe we could just ask
Pico Patrick here a little bit about what
[SPEAKER_01]: he's been doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, that's the whole point of the
entire conversation, but maybe just a
[SPEAKER_01]: little brief thing on what he's been up to
just recently and maybe touch a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: on the bank seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my most recent job is in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left California last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got laid off at the end of the season,
which I'm sure we'll get into a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just prices plummeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we had a great year,
but it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through luckily some good networking,
I was able to find a job relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something I kind of passed on
earlier because I didn't want to give up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was running an outdoor operation and
didn't want to kind of give up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of the season and go take a job
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So circled back on that and currently
doing that, which is in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hundred thousand square foot
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing indoor, which is a back to
indoor for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't been in that in a couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like any other aspect of working with
the plant, I just learn new things every
[SPEAKER_00]: single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really drives me to just continue
on this journey and keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been the most recent iteration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, you like you've told me and I've
read, I read your interview in skunk mag
[SPEAKER_01]: that you've obviously been working at
scale for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be quite cool for us to
get into later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we can, we can talk about the bank
if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, that was a really cool project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good thing to segue into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially when I got the job at the
bank, I was kind of doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was out there looking for work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had gotten a license in Sonoma County,
had fallout with a partner, had to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the building that we own.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time and the license and made a
partnership with an extract company to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That partnership just fell, fell apart
really, really quickly and ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving that position and then was pretty
much freelancing for a little while,
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some sales and some other things in
the industry and then was looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an outfit that I had interviewed with
prior due to some other, some good
[SPEAKER_00]: networking and try to get in with as far
as just a grower, any job working in their
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery ended up circling back on me and
interviewing me for what they were looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for at the time, which was just someone
who could come in, make seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow seeds at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were doing 32 acres the first year I
was with them and they wanted to plant all
[SPEAKER_00]: of it from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a series of depth crops that
were getting planted and there was also a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're talking like, you know,
one farm would have 170,000 seeds twice a
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So massive, massive amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first part of the job was making
all the seed, which I was tasked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the interview, I told them,
you know, I haven't done this at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had only done one reversal prior and
they wanted all femme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was like, I was very honest with
them and telling them like, I know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: do this, but I've never done it at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was lacking a lot of confidence to
say the least, but they basically were
[SPEAKER_00]: very supportive and told me, look,
if you will come in and take this job and
[SPEAKER_00]: try it, we'll learn together, you know,
and fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, it all worked out really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reversals were extremely successful
and we made 3 million seeds in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the rate, at the rate of,
you know, growing a couple hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand a year and making millions in the
first year, I had essentially somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: worked myself out of that job because we
made so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I ask you, just, can I just interrupt
you and ask what did you, what do you feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like you learned from this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, from that job?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the entire reversal process,
I'm very analytical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, for what we were doing with
STS reversals, just the proper amount,
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking it per strain, tracking it per
specific varieties and looking at lineages
[SPEAKER_00]: to see if there were going to be
correlations with other strains I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to reverse and how successful or
non-successful they would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many plants per seed you're going to
get per square foot, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how big the receiver should be those
timelines of staggering the donors and the
[SPEAKER_00]: receivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the ideal timeline is depending on
those genetics and their finishing times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's also a,
there's a graph as far as for seed
[SPEAKER_00]: maturation, how long you want the seed to
actually continue to mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's four, I believe there's four
carrot, like four data sets that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for that all hit their peak at a
different time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the germination rate,
the storage rate, and there's two others,
[SPEAKER_00]: one's vigor and one's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ideally, you're going to have several
timelines to where you hit all of those at
[SPEAKER_00]: their peak before you start to basically
get diminishing returns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you overdo the seeds, they'll have
the crack shells, which obviously nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They germinate just fine, but nobody wants
to buy those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So isn't that wild?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that they still grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, like, I remember what line was the
first time I saw that Bodie did it with,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was one of the G13 hash plant lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem 91 G13 hash plant was the first time
I saw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like he sent me a bunch and they were
kind of cracked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think they still grow and they did,
which blew my mind, you know, considering
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought air was getting in and get to
dry it out, but they did crack pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: well, but nobody wants to buy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to buy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, honestly, they, they crack a
little bit easier because you there's the
[SPEAKER_00]: water will penetrate, you know,
into the embryo right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they don't have to actually break
through the shell to get up above the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, depending upon what substrate
you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using like, you know,
little Excel plugs or something or rock,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those things can be challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can make you it easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, nobody wants to buy those and
they look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's certain strains that just that
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even when you take it to the number of
days that you would want to go to for all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the other things that you're looking
for in a great seed, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some strangers got to take them a week
earlier, two weeks earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that crack doesn't actually happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learning things like that, I was doing
crop registration on all this acreage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that came a lot of other plant
diagnosis that was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time I saw a beet curly top virus
and thank God.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, creating to be able to identify
that in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it's very wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, it runs its course fair fairly
quickly, like 30, 35 days and it's out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes from wherever the bite site is
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything below and on any other branch
is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't affect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many times it got bit by the leaf
hoppers that carry it will affect how
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible the plant is in yield and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it'll take a plant that's
about to be 10 feet tall and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven feet around and turn it into a tiny
little squat bush that is like two feet by
[SPEAKER_00]: two feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yield impacts are tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to run its course, but you're
not going to get good viable bud off those
[SPEAKER_00]: branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a great learning experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just everything at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up running the farm ops on that,
you know, with that outfit, the prior year
[SPEAKER_00]: or the next year rather, because I made
all the seed and we didn't really need
[SPEAKER_00]: that as much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it was just about growing the seed
and running the farm ops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They liked what I did from a plant
diagnosis standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a lot of videos, again,
shared a lot of information, would give
[SPEAKER_00]: reports back on all the crops and where we
were at with the acreage and then would
[SPEAKER_00]: try to map out the harvest plan,
which was insane because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're running that many acres,
it's all the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you need so and you need a place big
enough to dry it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're talking about another episode
that people really don't take that into
[SPEAKER_02]: consideration, especially when they're
new.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like that is a major, major
consideration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you dry it all?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're making seeds, how do you
store it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the seeds start falling out bit
by bit, like how do you catch them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Identify with what plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's so much it goes into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the seeds were made and kept in a
totally different area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a 10 acre nursery that would be all
seed production, nursery operations,
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning, seed making.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was just in that in that
nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was like independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of the growing acreage was
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was across multiple counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like putting a lot of miles on
the car and doing a lot of driving,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was also awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was it was like the ideal job.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that I had a job just to make
seed was the world to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, I'll do whatever it takes
to keep this job.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a seed maker's dream to be able to
grow at scale, pop a bunch of stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to see and get paid to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never found that, you know,
and I've been doing this a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that that that is something special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something for those listening
that aren't really that keen on what goes
[SPEAKER_02]: on in the seed business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a common thing to be offered that
kind of job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anyone had it before or
since.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was super lucky, super lucky to be in
that position and right place,
[SPEAKER_00]: right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Networking has been so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything that I've been able to do,
I mean, just with you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like even being in this chat right now is
because of good networking and keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with so with that, with that job,
with its unique challenges and with what
[SPEAKER_00]: we basically want, I had to put any of my
ego and any of my prior work kind of to
[SPEAKER_00]: the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was working for someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to fulfill what they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would sell for them wasn't
necessarily the stuff that I was making.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for those years, that I was with
them, I was really doing a lot of O.P.W.,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is other people's work, which I was
fine with because, again, I had my dream
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go do crop edge and I'm still doing
the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was all good from my perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, the challenge that we had
was genetics, sourcing genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: always having good genetics and always
having the next thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I was doing it, the way I was
being asked to do it was using other
[SPEAKER_00]: people's work from the previous season or
the previous cuts that had come in and
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing and matching and doing all that
kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was always catering to a very
fickle market that wants something new all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, there's no like actual line
breeding or learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not really getting heritability of
traits and the things that are really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting, except for the auto flower
work, which was probably one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest learning experiences because.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I started the Bank Seed Hub
with the partner who was the owner of the
[SPEAKER_00]: company, which the idea that that was so
many great breeders who had amazing brands
[SPEAKER_00]: already had been left out of legalization
for one reason or another, whether it was
[SPEAKER_00]: they were in a garage and they were never
going to get the zoning correct to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to have their seeds enter the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is before the 2018 farm bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was still a lot of like very,
very gray area as far as how anybody would
[SPEAKER_00]: get seeds anywhere on this scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two facilities that were being opened
up across the country that were totally
[SPEAKER_00]: legal and compliant, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I started the Bank Seed Hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea of that was to basically be a
conduit or a bridge to all these other
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing breeders who are out there to come
to this 10 acre facility, make your seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: here or give us the plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us what you want us to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make the seeds for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will sell them back to you at a certain
price if you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go hit the market with
them, we'll grow out a shitload of them as
[SPEAKER_00]: many as you possibly want us to grow out
so that we can do the crop registration,
[SPEAKER_00]: phenol hunts and keep building for the
next season and basically just offer the
[SPEAKER_00]: resources that we had to all the amazing
breeders who are already out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the whole idea with the Bank
Seed Hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked for what it was designed for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you guys know, many of these
breeders are very hard to kind of get in
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very guarded.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I come with an opportunity like that
from someone that they don't know and have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough business with before, it's going to
be very skeptically, which it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had developed relationships first with
the people that I knew and had
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships with that I thought would be
a good jumping off point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that, I knew that in the short
term, it would quickly kind of start to
[SPEAKER_00]: snowball and grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if we had another year or two,
we would have seen that really start to
[SPEAKER_00]: become a roundtable kind of coalition of
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I envisioned and I called it was the
Sunday Mass, which was the Mutual
[SPEAKER_00]: Admiration Society of Seed Makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would all someday we would come
together and we would be able to form this
[SPEAKER_00]: group where everybody is gaining in the
same amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take away the competitive element a
little bit, even the playing field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could have a very real brick
and mortar or some type of actual bank
[SPEAKER_00]: where all the brands represented,
all the breeders are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all 100 percent legal and compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do business with anyone we want to
do business with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the whole idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to say that we have heard
different people's attempts or initiatives
[SPEAKER_01]: to collectivize in different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've heard from Little Hill,
Matt, obviously with the Breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: Syndicate, and now you with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of you has a slightly different take
on collectivization, but it's super cool
[SPEAKER_01]: to see and hear about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's not common for breeders to
even get along to accomplish a goal like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is something that takes years and
years and years to build with trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, you're well on your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's got a little like bone to pick
with everybody else, it seems so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's myself included.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and some others with you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you know, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But things change quite a bit when you all
are in the same room together,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're all physically talking and
have the same absolutely the same thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that ego gets stripped away and
things become what they should be about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was about the plant, about sharing,
about the community, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just about weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it should be about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last the last thing that we did
with the Bank Seed Hub in the last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: things were pulled back quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a lot more from Clone and we're
running less and less of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did an acre hunt and I got like
five or six friends that all had fenn
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to throw in with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did an acre that was just going to
be all of us together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't really work out the way I wanted
with being able to produce some content,
[SPEAKER_00]: give everybody on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has different schedules.
[SPEAKER_00]: People had moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was harder for them to get back to
California to kind of see the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was documenting it all and trying to
share it as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was like the beginning of the
fruition of all the goals to have even
[SPEAKER_00]: half a dozen breeders that would throw
their work in together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I could have gotten them all
together to that site, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we're viewing each other's work and
like making selections together and
[SPEAKER_00]: picking out the little nuances of what we
liked about this cross or that cross or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was that was really what I
envisioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we almost got there at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, California ended up,
you know, prices of outdoor went down to
[SPEAKER_00]: like sub 500 and it was a total shit show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you got to pay excise tax and you
got to pay all these other insane bills,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the county of Sonoma was like just
trying to really bend us over and just hit
[SPEAKER_00]: us for these ridiculous fines all the time
and just crazy shit, constantly crazy shit
[SPEAKER_00]: from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I unfortunately was let go from that
position and had to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: do the new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was great while I lasted in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dream is still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that I can continue to kind of see
that mission through and exciting that
[SPEAKER_00]: where I'm at in Arizona, they're giving me
pretty much carte blanche to do any
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing massive seed hunts there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just fill the room with twenty five
hundred plants all from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's six different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a couple hundred of each one
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be the first like being
seen on project on that site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I am doing a reversal in the
greenhouse right now, which should net
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a few seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really exciting projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I hope to kind of be able to
bring other folks back into that fold and
[SPEAKER_00]: continue the same idea and offer that
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like now I have indoor space, which is one
of the biggest complaints about the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that was we were doing all outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wanted to take pictures and content
of their outdoor flower because for
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever reason, they think it's bad or
they can't sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I have the basically the same idea
that I think I can replicate, bring it
[SPEAKER_00]: inside and hopefully make a mutual
admiration and a mutually beneficial group
[SPEAKER_00]: of people that would want to take place
and take part in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the company I'm working for,
it's all good for them, too, because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting access to all these
genetics and all these different things
[SPEAKER_00]: for their sales that they wouldn't
otherwise have or they'd have to pay for
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you let us know if we can help in
any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously we have a platform of
sorts and have a certain kind of reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you should just hit us up if you can
think of anything that we can help with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I definitely like to deliver
completed ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me continue to work on the mission
right now and make sure that I want it
[SPEAKER_00]: now, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have to make sure that I can
execute and be successful for everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: else, you know, before I can before I can
really just open up the floodgates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is the long term goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if anybody's interested in
having those conversations, I certainly
am.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you're working, you know,
your previous gig working on that scale
[SPEAKER_01]: probably forced you to systematize a lot,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I always have, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Operations are a big just part of my flow
with anything with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I thought we could kind of go
backwards in time a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you could talk to us about what
the early period for you was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: making season growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what drew you to those things?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you get into it to begin with?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how did you learn about those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so I'm from Ohio originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Ohio, the first grow kind of group
that I was a part of, they were growing
[SPEAKER_00]: all from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was no clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that was even happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was all DJ short, sensi,
just a bunch of old school stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: White Widow, Blueberry, Super Silver Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that with that early sort of
introduction, like seeds were the first
[SPEAKER_00]: thing for me, you know, so when I ended up
returning back to them around like 2010 or
[SPEAKER_00]: so, it was like a it was like a
homecoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, oh, this is the way we were
always supposed to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we like kind of lost sight for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those early days back in Ohio,
all from seed, everything was selected in
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just because it was a very
closed group and didn't want anybody to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what the hell we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't have friends that had clones and
probably wouldn't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like was parked the car like two miles
away and carrying grow equipment down the
[SPEAKER_00]: street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seemed like a better idea than parking
your car after Green Merchant,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, I carry this fucking light
and these ballots and everything else and
[SPEAKER_00]: try to make it in one trip, which was
ridiculous just to not have my license
[SPEAKER_00]: plate in front of that store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of the, you know,
that was kind of the viewpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very it was very stigmatized in
Ohio in my area, even from my close
[SPEAKER_00]: friends who now are totally cool that it
was it was still like I was kind of off to
[SPEAKER_00]: the side and on my own a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, from there, I ended up one of
the guys who was part of that group who
[SPEAKER_00]: was really just more of a he was more of a
scammer kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was more like just in it for the money
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't have a nice letter kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't even really smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, he did eventually,
but he's he's like the reason that people
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, he's got to like out of
pocket and was doing stupid shit and
[SPEAKER_00]: acting a fool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't have him around anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but that was his whole thing was just
sort of like I'm just trying to make
[SPEAKER_00]: money, you know, which was fine,
too, because it gave me a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up moving out to the Bay Area
to do some trim work for him and just help
[SPEAKER_00]: out because it was exploding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, the O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds were 58, 57 down in L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, fuck yeah, I was getting
paid a shitload just to come and trim just
[SPEAKER_00]: because he didn't want to have to hire
some randos to come trim and he reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So relocated from Ohio out to California
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything was from clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from there, it's we're growing O.G.,
Snowcap, Blue Dream, Blackberry Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: Nightshade, you know, some other random
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually that whittled down to like,
you know, maybe 10 percent anything but O
[SPEAKER_00]: .G.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everything is O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: all from clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a long time, you know, and everything
was going to L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what year was this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was I moved out to California 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right around there, 2007 through 2012
or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what became pretty apparent,
like, you know, right away was if we it
[SPEAKER_00]: was always like, oh, we need the next O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, now we need Skywalker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we need King Louie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we need this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, well, we can just get
this from like we can just go backwards,
[SPEAKER_00]: buy the seed, make selections and have
something totally unique that nobody else
[SPEAKER_00]: has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's and that's where I was starting
to look in other lines because O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: was really boring at that point because it
was like, that's all we fucking grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's splitting hairs between the cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people don't realize,
like some of them, they could be the same
[SPEAKER_02]: cut with just two different names.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get real boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ninety percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ninety percent of them were the same cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just little conditional
differences from inviting the plant.
Shared whatever the cut would be,
that's one of the things I was really
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in, is how to show the
environment that would really change the
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance or what was expressing in the
plant was more so based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental changes based on these
people's grow rooms and how they built
[SPEAKER_00]: them, which is kind of an interesting
thing, like your signature is kind of in
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of an interesting concept.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but yeah, it was just really boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, fuck, I need these flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was in love with the banana flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had banana O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to find that in a seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted I couldn't get a cut anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to seeds and I think some of the
first seeds that I bought when I was in
[SPEAKER_00]: California were off of seed Bay,
you know started with some of that Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: growing stuff like the ogre 99 that we
talked about and that's the that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-roll that I gave you that was that
super remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah So still talk about that I still talk
about it when people ask about banana
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like and I did a lot of banana work
myself So I I've got a pretty good working
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge of that line and how it reads if
that was exceptional And yeah people ask
[SPEAKER_02]: me about banana flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, well, there was one very
specific one That was the most extreme
[SPEAKER_02]: banana bread turps that it was just
unmistakable Like anybody who smelled that
[SPEAKER_00]: would smell that and that was like a
seven-weeker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like it's so And and the ogre 99
was made probably years prior and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: not kept in great condition So yeah by the
time I even got those seeds it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: they were probably I don't know five years
old six years old I don't know when she
[SPEAKER_00]: made them but they were old and to only
two germinated So the one was a female one
[SPEAKER_00]: was a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has 11 that one Female was what I
called the banana 99 cut that was just the
[SPEAKER_00]: most phenomenal banana Seven-weeker
yielded the fucking beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect doesn't have to love the odds on
that Yeah, I know I know not only that but
[SPEAKER_00]: then I used the male because I'm like,
well shit There might be some banana in
[SPEAKER_00]: this guy, too So I used the male in my
earliest breeding work just to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue that and and he put out amazing
work I mean that's still the backbone of
[SPEAKER_00]: what I grow today and what I breed today
and those lines is still rooted in that
[SPEAKER_00]: ogre 99 cut and the male from that pack
Those are still like the basis is and then
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some What was the other one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet tooth number three from I think
deluxe had done a remake or something I
[SPEAKER_00]: got that because I was just fucking head
over heels for the tangerine haze that
[SPEAKER_00]: came from the Devil's Harvest crew Oh my
god, that plant was so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like nobody the Flavor was just
unbelievable with the tangerine NYC DG 13
[SPEAKER_02]: haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, exactly and It was like the flavor
was so fucking good and the high was
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely up extremely zippy and up and
Everybody who smoked it who was looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for like a downer couch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Locky weed hated it because it didn't do
that But I had a very specific experience
[SPEAKER_00]: where I was down in LA vending I'd always
go to Malibu to first point to go surfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had smoked some og with my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had come down there with Me and we were
just like fucking floored, you know after
[SPEAKER_00]: a day of surfing in the ocean here It's
like already kind of drained and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked this og and it was like I was like,
oh my god I'm so fucking lethargic and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I remember smoking the tangerine haze
after that and being like right back to
[SPEAKER_00]: like Just you know cognitive lucid
everything was fucking good again And I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, this is the fucking like this is
more powerful than that og It's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different effect that you're
not feeling from like a sober to high
[SPEAKER_00]: state, but it's like If I was already high
and too low man, that thing brought me
[SPEAKER_00]: right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, this is fucking amazing So that
was that was a magical one, but I used the
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet tooth to try to like preserve that
flavor as much as possible So those are
[SPEAKER_00]: the two earliest breeding project I did
really was using the banana oger and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: male and I made f2s but I did all sorts of
other work with him and then trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve the tangerine haze as much as
possible by using the sweet tooth F2 the
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet tooth number 3f2, which I don't know
how many times that's in crossed but um,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was pretty much the earliest stuff
and the result We're fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be it be it luck be it whatever like we
got fucking great plans from every single
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that got touched by the pollen and
Nobody was really complaining at that time
[SPEAKER_00]: until I accidentally seeded an entire room
and then and then Then I got a little
[SPEAKER_02]: pushback on that's when they stopped
liking seeds as much as the entire room
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly when they stopped liking
seeds so much at that point They got
[SPEAKER_00]: referred to as art projects and I was no
longer Which is honestly what ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: being the impetus for me leaving that
outfit and starting my own thing was based
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% on that I was like, well,
this is the ticket like we got to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this and they're like No,
we got to do none of that and just go back
[SPEAKER_00]: to growing blue dream and I was like,
alright this I have a different vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a different vision than what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So That's when I kind of broke off on my
own and left You know the safe haven of a
[SPEAKER_00]: very tight-knit friends group that I had
and it had moved across the country For
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody that was working with us at
the time was from Ohio for the most part
[SPEAKER_00]: so that was sort of the impetus for
leaving that group was the souring of
[SPEAKER_00]: popping seeds For them, you know not for
me Collateral damage man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just ended up with more seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean I Wanted to take a little
tangent here and I want to throw this bone
[SPEAKER_01]: to Matt as well, which is the forums You
mentioned I think in one of in that
[SPEAKER_01]: interview in skunk mag That the forums
played quite a big part in your early
[SPEAKER_00]: stages Definitely and and a great great
point to mention or a great place to
[SPEAKER_00]: mention that so that was really I was on
IC mag the guy that I had initially
[SPEAKER_00]: learned from whose nickname is cool white
by the way, which I fucking love because
[SPEAKER_00]: he He burned down a house by not putting
an anchor and in a light and putting it up
[SPEAKER_00]: in drywall So when he went to jail all the
all the guys In jail call them cool white
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, he'll probably love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out cool white Super egomaniacal
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he'll definitely enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah use his name for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but so He was on overgrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was big on overgrow I'm sure he was an
asshole because he was an asshole in real
[SPEAKER_00]: life so I can only imagine how bad he was
on overgrow but But I was on IC mag mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the seed bay linkage and that's
just where I was buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was Super paranoid still,
you know, the same mentality had followed
[SPEAKER_00]: me through and was a lurker I would like
put my fucking laptop on private mode and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe go somewhere else That wasn't my
regular IP address and go even surf it and
[SPEAKER_00]: look around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah But but yeah watching some of the
threads on IC mag, especially the Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayhoff or stuff Which which is I think is
Ivan right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and and it was like the early cocoa
beds that they were doing I just and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're real quick you're referring to
jungle boys Ivan for the people who don't
[SPEAKER_00]: Know right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Jack Mayhoffer so Jack Mayhoffer's
threads were epic as far as just like
[SPEAKER_00]: scale growing and and What they were doing
now, I'm sure or what they're doing then
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't do it all now But my my idea
and sort of what I was following was fully
[SPEAKER_00]: soil organic growing living soil And so
his idea of these giant beds In your room
[SPEAKER_00]: was just like right in tune with what I
was trying to do so I used the tech that
[SPEAKER_00]: he was kind of providing on IC mag and all
the other information about nutrition and
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil and all the other stuff that
was available on there and really just
[SPEAKER_00]: just ran with it, but it gave me a lot of
confidence to Kind of know what to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: learn from other people's failures,
especially And and that was that was
[SPEAKER_00]: quintessential and then so much strain
knowledge and and now I really I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: gone on there in so long but Just so much
information and the thing was that all the
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshitters got called out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have that anymore like Instagram
is such a step backwards from the sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: of information because agreed and I don't
think Twitter does it either I'm not on
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter, but I would imagine that doesn't
do it either But the power is in the words
[SPEAKER_00]: the words are the knowledge the pictures
support the words But the words are where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's at on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the facade Here's what it looks
like the words are almost meaningless You
[SPEAKER_00]: throw a couple emojis up there and then
you know cute conversations that are also
[SPEAKER_00]: meaningless, which is usually just a
circle Yeah, well Instagram for me is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of just such a huge step back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a necessary platform I think because
it's the only one that we really have but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just such a step backwards as far as
like sharing information and sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: Reality because none of it is steeped in
reality whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Think I think that's a common sentiment
to among people who've been around and
[SPEAKER_02]: made it through the forum air and stuff
Being able to have that and that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: community and then going to Instagram It's
just totally it's a night and day
[SPEAKER_02]: difference and it's actually pretty
depressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah It is I mean, I just appreciate it
was policed a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it was just it was generally
really solid information You can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: tell what wasn't and what was but
generally really solid and if you needed
[SPEAKER_00]: verification of a cut or something you
could get it pretty easily and Or people
[SPEAKER_00]: will just call you out and tell you how
fake your shit is which also can be
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable just to know Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there I see Meg was really really
awesome I really enjoyed it and the first
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the first few people that I met up
with And you know became like in real life
[SPEAKER_00]: friends with were from I see Meg too and
that was cool because that sort of opened
[SPEAKER_00]: up more of the networking gateway to like
Sharing information getting stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know sharing weed sharing concentrate
sharing tech Sharing opportunities,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that all of those things really
came along with I see Meg So I'm super
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful for that forum and all the forums
that proceeded it as well Yeah Are you
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna jump on the can of Cabana?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will yes, unfortunately time is so
restrictive for me right now between the
[SPEAKER_00]: job and the kids that it's just I just
Have the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean I don't have the time to do I
don't even have time to smoke as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like honestly or a place to do it I'm
in my kids room right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was telling thousand fold before it's
like the only place I can get away That's
[SPEAKER_00]: what quiet and not in the garage looking
depressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I just don't have the time for it
right now I wish I did but I'm so I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in my own forum world So to speak in
the in what we're doing because the
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred thousand square foot is perpetual
I've got nine different grow rooms that
[SPEAKER_00]: are all going at the same time And it all
a week apart so I can see very much the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire like week one through nine of
What's happening in a room at all times?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is really cool to just try progress
and and kind of make my new changes and
[SPEAKER_00]: see the results of those types of things
So I just get so much value out of that I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really go to the forums quite as
much anymore It was really a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: a crotch a lot of information and and now
it's because it's there's so little
[SPEAKER_00]: activity there It just wouldn't be as
valuable for the things I would probably
[SPEAKER_00]: use it for today, which would be more like
Verification of cuts and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: provenance and things like that And we
have our discord to where we can all jam
[SPEAKER_00]: on that which is really nice I mean that's
been that's been a great thing Honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: the discord has been awesome and I've and
that's been the main type of forum thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've interacted with in the last Six
years, I think I've been on that thing now
[SPEAKER_02]: with yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's been a long time, bro Yeah,
I remember messaging messaging Denali the
[SPEAKER_00]: night I was in the hospital and he just
turned five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Wow Wait, so did you two cross over on
the forums?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no No, we met an Emerald Cup Yeah,
so I remember exactly how we started
[SPEAKER_00]: talking You had said something on a post I
posted something at the time I had my
[SPEAKER_00]: company was called the moody and I was
running that Instagram and Your bio had a
[SPEAKER_00]: stone roses Love yeah, and I love the
stone roses and so few people know about
[SPEAKER_00]: the stone roses that I was like He's
already in me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking love that dude The first time I
sent you something I sent it to cinnamon
[SPEAKER_00]: girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude So nobody even listens to them
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're the best man music and we
those are the unifiers Those are the
[SPEAKER_00]: things for me that I've always like
brought people and made friends has been
[SPEAKER_00]: like if there's two icebreakers for me
It's music and weed and those have always
[SPEAKER_00]: been true even to this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I still use that quote.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's in my profile still to this
day I figured you were cool when I saw
[SPEAKER_02]: that man It creeps people out though,
like cuz they don't get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a quote from stone rose a song It
just sounds like a my evil Satanist
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else on the forums, uh No,
I enjoy I wish I would have done more
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, I was more of a lurker I wish I
would have interacted more with people and
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish they were still as used as they are
today Yeah, I mean going back to what you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys are talking about between say the
forums and Instagram or Twitter the
[SPEAKER_01]: architecture, you know, obviously lends
itself to Different things so on Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: and Twitter It's very hard to sustain a
conversation for more than a few days,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because just disappears into the timeline
the abyss of noise and you're so limited
[SPEAKER_02]: on what you can say It's not like you can
really express yourself very well kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like Twitter, you know You're limited to a
certain amount of character sets And
[SPEAKER_02]: people don't want to read long sentences
So you'll find that most people just
[SPEAKER_02]: respond to the first few things you say or
the image and not read what you wrote So
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of miscommunication that
goes on Yeah, and it feels like also
[SPEAKER_01]: people are encouraged to like spit out
zingers like, you know, witty one-liners
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff rather than actually a
thoughtful You know articulation of
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just about like you were
reflexive knee-jerk reactions Yeah at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely agree with you I definitely
enjoyed the linear nature of the forums
[SPEAKER_00]: because I would wake up in the morning Go
back to wherever I left off catch up on
[SPEAKER_00]: all that, you know the chit chat whatever
was going on and Just follow along with
[SPEAKER_00]: the conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I Once it got it got ridiculous to a
point I remember the slow nickel lounge
[SPEAKER_00]: had like 800 pages or something and it was
like, holy shit I went to bed and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: were at like 528 I wake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at like 600 and something I'm like,
holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even catch up So I guess there's a
downside to it too when it gets that much
[SPEAKER_00]: use But yeah, I miss the forums man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that was a good that was a
good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: San Diego's fine It's got so big they had
to blow it up into like a second and third
[SPEAKER_02]: I think now it might just still be on
second But yeah, that was one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorites Yeah when threads become their
own forums Right and they lock it at a
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep Well, I thought we could kind of segue
to Pico's I mean obviously people you've
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about some of the work that you
have done yourself You talked about the
[SPEAKER_01]: banana stuff Can you tell us a bit more
about some of your own recent work,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know nightcap hazes Yeah, so um,
so from that initial project with the ogre
[SPEAKER_00]: 99 I crossed out to Blackberry Kush,
which was a staple for us at the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: From those found some really cool plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called it gargamel It was an interesting
plant nothing like too crazy, but it had a
[SPEAKER_00]: very very good look got great color had
good flavor It was kind of like pretzels
[SPEAKER_00]: with like a hint of licorice on the back
end which I really really liked and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: Ended up getting a cut from a buddy that
was supposed to be gorilla glue for I
[SPEAKER_00]: checked it on the forums You know I hit up
that that that group and I think Marlo was
[SPEAKER_00]: the dudes name who called me out and told
me that's bullshit That's not gorilla glue
[SPEAKER_00]: for and I was like, well, whatever it is
It's fucking awesome and it might be
[SPEAKER_00]: better than gorilla glue for because like
I never even experienced anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: this That one we ended up taking it to
market before I knew it was not really
[SPEAKER_00]: before we took it to market And you know
taking it to like Oakland and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: like now this to saying it and and their
best guess at what it was was grease
[SPEAKER_00]: monkey, which was gorilla glue for and
Something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget what the cross was on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a exotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that was exotic Yeah,
it was exotic genetics and and regrettably
[SPEAKER_00]: we ended up taking that name and calling
it grease monkey 2.0 We didn't we couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: confirm it was or wasn't sure the guy who
but it but if that was what they wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: call it and that was one of those,
you know We could sell to the club because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was super dank then I was fine with it,
you know So we end up calling that grease
[SPEAKER_00]: monkey 2.0 for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Ended up making some s ones of that
which may have been an s1 already because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was the fake gorilla glues I don't know
what the hell it was But the s1 of that
[SPEAKER_00]: that I popped I popped one seed every time
I'd make something I just throw one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two, you know in in just to kind of see
and get a look under the hood and this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant pops and it was like the the first
set of true leaves after cotyledon was
[SPEAKER_00]: like Covered in trichomes like covered in
the the sessile type, you know the type
[SPEAKER_00]: without the glandular stock and and it was
glistening and it was like Amazing and I
[SPEAKER_00]: could smell it right out there was like
fresh pine and coriander is unbelievable
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant continued to grow up and veg and
it just kept having these trichomes on
[SPEAKER_00]: every single leaf Like the fan leaf is
covered in trikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so fragrant I knew it was gonna be
like fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just meant to be So that's what
ended up becoming boss frost For us boss
[SPEAKER_00]: boss frost like ruled the day for us for a
minute We went to the 2016 high times cup
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was the only thing I've ever
entered into a cup It hit six point six on
[SPEAKER_00]: the turps and 33 on the total can it blew
everything else out of the water the the
[SPEAKER_00]: norcal cup was The lab was steep hill that
did the norcal cup and they were they were
[SPEAKER_00]: very very rigid And so they had to test it
multiple times even to to to confirm that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what it had tested at but that's
what they Ended up finally releasing for
[SPEAKER_00]: the test results So that thing that I
entered didn't place didn't do shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very disappointed I thought for sure
because of this the test results and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else that it was gonna kill it
Didn't really matter But that crossed into
[SPEAKER_00]: the gargamel ended up being nightcap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I just did a small seed run You
know like one plant couple hundred seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing big threw two of them into pots
just to see what was up right away and one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those two became Nightcap, I never even
went back to the seeds again nightcap was
[SPEAKER_00]: better than boss frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like danker more earthy Heavier,
you know it boss frost was like very
[SPEAKER_00]: ground coriander really bright like really
bright flavors and the nightcap was just
[SPEAKER_00]: way way danker and That one we ended up
hitting eight point one percent turps on
[SPEAKER_00]: super high in alpha pining But does have a
backbone of myrcine to it's like kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: one two or two to one alpha pining to
myrcine in that and was the turp champ for
[SPEAKER_00]: SC labs for a couple years till I think
Those guys up at the ridge ridge farm
[SPEAKER_00]: ridge something they they ended up
usurping me with a couple like tenths of a
[SPEAKER_00]: point You know on that and at the time we
were putting out in the living soil We
[SPEAKER_00]: were putting out amazing stuff our own
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my own genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I had some help and everything
was killing it in the turps from SC labs
[SPEAKER_00]: like boss frost I never saw go below four
and a half and that was on like the
[SPEAKER_00]: shittiest shittiest grow and Nightcap was
always just killing it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cool thing about nightcap is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpene profile this is where I
started really getting a terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_00]: like around 2014 2015 when I started my
own outfit was doing this living soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else I opted in to lab testing
immediately because I wanted the data,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to pick the best labs I would use
T pillar SC and I just wanted to keep one
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I keep it as simple as possible
so that I would get as true a data set as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible Through all the different things
we were doing in the grow trying on
[SPEAKER_00]: different things and running different
strains and whatever so at the time I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: the boss frost and the nightcap were super
high in alpha pining and were the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: things they would ever see it would take
me weeks to get my turp test back because
[SPEAKER_00]: they kept having to retest it to confirm
that these numbers were accurate enough
[SPEAKER_00]: for them to put out and at the time SC
labs was was Making public all their test
[SPEAKER_00]: results if you didn't ask for it to be
private They would make it public and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could go and you could Scrape all the data
off of their website and you could pull
[SPEAKER_00]: tens of thousands of tests so after that
and I had a pretty decent relationship as
[SPEAKER_00]: like a client to Alec Dixon one of the
founders of SC labs and He would shout us
[SPEAKER_00]: out all the time and we had a lot of
conversations because my test would take
[SPEAKER_00]: so long to get back I would always be
calling him like what the hell's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: and we would have a lot of conversations
and he was just like You know really
[SPEAKER_00]: impressed with the amount of turps we were
getting off all the strains that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing especially these unique lines and
And what he shared with me and we could
[SPEAKER_00]: see from the data was that all of the
cannabis that was tested was falling into
[SPEAKER_00]: these like seven Categories, you know now
that's what the Emerald Cup is using as
[SPEAKER_00]: their groupings for it to get away from
the sativa and indica Designation and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're using these, you know,
I forget what the words are dessert
[SPEAKER_00]: something whatever the words are kind of
tacky but the exotic dessert dreams Yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: in dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right So the I mean they're trying
to simplify it and that's a corporate
[SPEAKER_00]: movement I'm sure but regardless of that
the idea that we now had we take this vast
[SPEAKER_00]: super plastic genome plant that can do so
many different things and we Make it
[SPEAKER_00]: finite right and we have seven categories
now that like almost all the weed fits
[SPEAKER_00]: into these seven categories That became
super interesting and my idea was that if
[SPEAKER_00]: I play within these categories Then I will
be able to breed homogenous strains much
[SPEAKER_00]: much quicker because I'm going to be
replicating this chemo type over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: and over again and so at least the
expression of the chemo type is gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: the same now there was a lot of
misinformation about the Like integral
[SPEAKER_00]: part of terpenes on flavors, you know,
which I kind of could tell right away
[SPEAKER_00]: because of that banana 99 cut I was
searching like okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the terpene that's giving us this
banana flavor, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a cookie at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it's it's amyl amyl acetate
That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an ester, you know same thing You see
an alcohol production when you drink and
[SPEAKER_00]: you get that banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amyl acetate and I had a background
in brewing beer as well just for fun But
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how I knew about that ester and so
other light bulbs starting to go off But
[SPEAKER_00]: the idea was the same that I follow within
these terpene categories and do my
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding work within those To add or take
away certain traits that I wanted and
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping other ones intact Mainly the
flavor and what I knew for the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles is that they would have a similar
effect for me anyway So I would what was
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting about the nightcap is that
it's the same flavor as all the
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-terpenaline hazes or the piff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if was something I was searching
after, you know as much as I possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: could at that time And again, this is like
2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was circulating cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't nobody had to keep black It
was like a total legend, you know lost to
[SPEAKER_00]: the times or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't find the shit There was some
work here there, but I ended up going to
[SPEAKER_00]: JJ I got a bunch of his stuff at one of
the animal cups or one of the high time
[SPEAKER_00]: shows and Started running through all his
stuff that was supposed to be you know as
[SPEAKER_00]: close to that as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got a man Go cut that was super
insensely from somebody else on the IC
[SPEAKER_00]: forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget the dude's name and made a bunch
of stuff I ended up finding some really
[SPEAKER_00]: nice very insensely non-terpenaline haze
expressions from his stuff Use that bread
[SPEAKER_00]: it down a couple generations to get what I
wanted out of it And then I paired that to
[SPEAKER_00]: the nightcap because it had the same
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to basically Take the flowering
time and reduce it tremendously Increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the bag appeal and the actual like density
the bud from what the haze that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: growing at the time was and and increase
the increase the Terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids by like a shitload.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was basically Allowing me to have
sort of a secret weapon in nightcap to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed hazes and shorten their flowering
time and do everything But it did affect
[SPEAKER_00]: the high, you know, the effect was
affected the flavor profile stayed the
[SPEAKER_00]: same but the effect was effect was
affected so nightcap was super influential
[SPEAKER_00]: in with my work and From that line
breeding with JJ's into the nightcap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made night piff Which is like a true
eight week flowering, you know haze type.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effect is a little stronger,
but it's still very heady It's very up and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's incense as hell when it when it burns
in the room And it just hit all the traits
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wanted right away So that was kind
of some of the idea of well one that was
[SPEAKER_00]: the nightcap and like what the nightcap
has become now I've worked that down
[SPEAKER_00]: several generations since then I have a
nightcap exotica line where I added an
[SPEAKER_00]: exotic in At the time that I made it I
didn't want to sort of piggyback off of
[SPEAKER_00]: the success of cookies and what they had
done But now with the cats out of the bag
[SPEAKER_00]: because other people had already leaked
the lineage So it is nightcap Gary Payton
[SPEAKER_00]: and then from there I bred that into
another exotic which I will not actually
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that one was the purple calves which
nobody can get anyway because that was a
[SPEAKER_00]: Cazadero strain that I was gifted by like
a family that wouldn't let anybody else
[SPEAKER_00]: have it So that's the nightcap exotic of
season two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I continue to do to do that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really high quality hypionine it's
the the pining the other thing that's
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting about the pining is that the
effect for me for high pining strains is
[SPEAKER_00]: very It's very lucid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get I don't get the inner
monologue I don't get the backseat driver
[SPEAKER_00]: where like I'm behind myself kind of
observing and commenting on myself or what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing or whatever, you know,
I Call the dumb mouth the dumb mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I don't get the dumb mouth from it
and and it's also extremely potent and the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason I called nightcap nightcap is
because that terpene profile for me with
[SPEAKER_00]: the potency with the high THC allows me to
drift off to sleep without any inner
[SPEAKER_00]: monologue or like My voice inside going
which is one of the things that gives me
[SPEAKER_00]: paranoia and stops me from falling asleep
So for me it was super easy on the
[SPEAKER_00]: nightcap to fall asleep because that
terpene profile it allows a very smooth
[SPEAKER_00]: transition from Sober to high or you know,
whatever you want to call that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like it's not as noticeable
that you do get the head effect you get
[SPEAKER_00]: the rush but It's not like holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I overdid it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm too high, you know, it's like I can
maintain the same train of thought And so
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time that this was 2016 I think
that that one popped and we were doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of work still with medical patients
and they were giving me the best feedback
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were Able to sleep through the
night didn't have to get up and go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bathroom getting restful sleep which if
you're ailing from anything like getting
[SPEAKER_00]: restful sleep is Like one of the two best
things you can possibly do regardless of
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else that you're taking you're
doing so Talking to cancer patients and
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to people with true medical need
who were impacted by that plant was And
[SPEAKER_00]: still is like a highlight for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're super amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nightcaps been on its journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I continue to use her today I continue to
breed her today and she's a magnificent
[SPEAKER_00]: plant again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was two seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So recently on my own discord I auctioned
off the the half of the remainder of those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that were left and Some lucky
gentleman picked them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's really good I kept half I
need that but you know, I just with her in
[SPEAKER_00]: the stable It's like if there's almost no
need to go back in and then and there was
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit of variance even in the two
that I popped it was like one was super
[SPEAKER_00]: squat and The one that I kept was really
tall lanky and had more of what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for So yeah, I'm happy to let some
of those things go and I have so many
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like what's you know, if I'm not
gonna get around to it Let's let somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: else grow it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about where I've gotten with a lot of
my collection too after a while you just
[SPEAKER_02]: start to realize like these things do have
a time limit and And I want to see him
[SPEAKER_02]: grown out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's either you get greedy about it
and let him die with you or you get him
[SPEAKER_02]: out there and be able to get data points
at least Yeah, I mean, it shouldn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: be a collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it's a perishable good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right Wait, I always bug the shit on
me when I see people these Matt like
[SPEAKER_00]: flexing with their massive collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I also learned to on the forums The people
who had posted their massive collections
[SPEAKER_02]: were always the first to get shipped down
and like Scammed and it was just setting
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself up so bad bad to do stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah This is a very FOMO driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm guilty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I did the same thing like I had
early on I think that's what we saw was
[SPEAKER_02]: cool You know, like the cooler guys were
showing off their killer, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever they had their big seed
collection So, of course, we'd follow suit
[SPEAKER_00]: as younger guys, you know Well,
the endorphin the endorphin experience is
[SPEAKER_00]: like in the person
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I honestly the psychology of it is
really interesting to me because seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves are obviously not plants and
they're not flower They're not end
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of promises of something else
And then when you even even the purchase
[SPEAKER_01]: of a seed is like a promise of a promise
and it's like these little gambles that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're kind of getting high on really When
we do this massive hunts now and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to like the crew that's working
under me That's what I never have used the
[SPEAKER_00]: term promise, but I'm going to now but I
always say If you let one of these seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: not if you let it dampen off or you don't
you know I mean, it's you're not like
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the seed properly or doing justice
if you lose seeds in a germination run
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you might have just lost Michael
Jordan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of his brothers did shit You can't
lose Michael Jordan man You got to see all
[SPEAKER_00]: those to their true potential to know and
that's the FOMO for me now It's like if I
[SPEAKER_00]: lose a plant or a plant is I'm like it's
not doing as well as it should I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna see its true potential That's like
where the FOMO is for me now and I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: like I need They have to be perfect It
could be missing that blue that beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: blue Funny because I found I found really
great things in really small runs I found
[SPEAKER_00]: really really amazing things in massive
runs and You know, the potential is there
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to lose is the potential I
was just trolling my buddy here who is
[SPEAKER_02]: popping some blue I X All right,
and that's gonna be our show for today I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to thank Pico for coming on
thousand of course for always helping
[SPEAKER_02]: setting things up being there with me to
ask some of the harder questions that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really good at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm only good asking bringing stuff Also
want you to go check out our patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you get access to our discord.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where we hang out all the time
We've been doing more live chats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'm gonna go run one today It's
really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get to interact with the whole
community Everybody gets to put their
[SPEAKER_02]: input on on what they want to see in shows
Gives us ideas for different topics
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's you know, I'm running out
of ideas over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am trying to take it back to more
breeding centric type show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So expect that definitely expect that We
have riot seeds calm with our seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the diesel drop the diesel
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the blue dream drop from goat farm
We're gonna have some new a new influx of
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff from high and lonesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe some mango haze hybrids coming
up shortly Going through testing right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also find our seeds at right seat
Co Europe for European people in Central
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe We have Gert by seeds for our
people in the southern hemisphere of
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia and New Zealand and then we have
lifted seeds Also here in the US but they
[SPEAKER_02]: can take like direct credit card payment
stuff and they're awesome people They're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing a great job of carrying extremely
good breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not every seed bank cares about that Even
if they say they do I don't know any other
[SPEAKER_02]: ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've really truly don't so with that Just
thanks for showing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for caring It means a lot to us
that we can keep doing this show and
[SPEAKER_02]: enough people give a shit about this topic
to keep it going There's been a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: times where it's almost Ended so thousand
deserves a lot more credit than I think a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people have been giving him in the
comments because without him the show
[SPEAKER_02]: would have been dead after the whole
Explosion, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not everybody knows about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to go into too much detail,
but We talked about it in the patreon
[SPEAKER_02]: crowd with everyone as it was going down,
you know, there's a reason that co-hosts
[SPEAKER_02]: change It was necessary, you know,
we hold each other to high standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: We absolutely do and sometimes Life gets
hard people slip up things change morals
[SPEAKER_02]: change moral fluidity as we talk about it
none of this shit is easy choices and Just
[SPEAKER_02]: know that like It's a good group of dudes
all holding each other really high
[SPEAKER_02]: standards And if someone falls back we put
them aside for a while, you know,
