[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_04]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_04]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_04]: seat.
[SPEAKER_04]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_04]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_04]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Syndicate is a collection of seed makers
that want to push back against all the
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_04]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Matthew here with my cohost,
Thousand Fault, and today we're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be talking to our friend Farmer Dan from
the Canna Luminati.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is an operator, a part of an MSO.
[SPEAKER_04]: He does the growing and breeding there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the growing, a lot of the
breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And today we're going to be talking about
a number of topics from the legal market
[SPEAKER_04]: to breeding to reversal sprays.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go all over the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you guys are going to enjoy
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good chance to get a bird's eye
view into one of these MSO that are large.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you start how we normally do start by
me asking, you know, how did you become
[SPEAKER_03]: involved with the plant, you know,
in your life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I think I started smoking weed
when I was like 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a buddy that had some like older
siblings and they would just rip us off
[SPEAKER_00]: for small sacks like constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just really shitty weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like nothing had names back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like the mid 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm 32 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to be 32 in a few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, my high school era was like
mid 2000s to 2009 and got ripped off on
[SPEAKER_00]: weed for just like, I don't know,
four or five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I met a buddy who he,
he grew some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would go up during the summers to
Medford and he, him and his like older
[SPEAKER_00]: brother, I think like grew some really
great blue cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why Matt, like I think it was the
first thing I ever bought from you was the
[SPEAKER_00]: blue cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to refine that plant has been a
pain in the ass, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause cheese is like so dominant and so
variant too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like so unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I remember I was telling you that
whole run, like fucking rebedged under
[SPEAKER_00]: 1212 right at the end of flower ruined the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fucking a on that front.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was like the first like good weed
that I ever really got that I knew like
[SPEAKER_00]: where it was from and like what the name
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kind of started like showing me all
kinds of shit about weed and like started
[SPEAKER_00]: selling me ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like 17 or 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I dropped out of high school in my
junior year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just like went on to try and do
my own thing and like figure shit out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I started smoking at 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like now, God, I've been smoking
for like 20 years every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I've seen, I've seen a lot of
weed just because of that duration,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though like I've only been a grower
for like, this is my 10th season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but that was the first time I got
good weed was from the, the homie Tim,
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever you're at nowadays, somewhere up
in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last I heard fucking a man, you guys had
some good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Tim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, he showed me like the,
the first vaporizer, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the box that not so I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had one of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what they call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even remember, but yeah,
it's the wooden box.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the heating element and the fucking
tube that you just got to like rip out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They figured out, Oh, you pack like
individual little, you know, one hitters
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and fucking, and that way it
doesn't taste like popcorn all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took me all the way till the last party
to learn that I would pack it full,
[SPEAKER_04]: like a normal bowl and just waste waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tastes like ass all the way through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets you something fucking high though,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a stronger high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes on slow too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just kind of like realize how
fucking lit you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always find vape highs so much stronger,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, and like you're saying, like for a
lot of people, if they just do it once,
[SPEAKER_04]: they may not understand the high cause
it's not familiar to them yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it may not feel the same and they may
not understand that they're higher,
[SPEAKER_04]: but once you get used to it and you could
do like some comparisons on, on actual
[SPEAKER_04]: like flower of the same flower to
different devices.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is like night and day, how,
how much different the high is and how
[SPEAKER_04]: much more impactful.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later on, I figured out the same
thing with the volcano.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I had a buddy who was a little
wealthier so he could afford that like
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking thousand dollar volcano or
whatever it was back then and did the bags
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we figured out the same thing,
straight line that thing with the tube
[SPEAKER_00]: from the other vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And just straight line it right from the
volcano.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get so fucking lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the guy that had the volcano,
this dude, he was the first person that
[SPEAKER_00]: ever showed me you could like grow weed
and like the one that I'd ever seen really
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: From start to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like, he had this place out in the
country and he had two or three plants of
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, you know, and it was fucking
fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just helped him water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he traveled a lot and no idea what I
was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I had some like a Fox farm,
like bloom, the tiger bloom, and then like
[SPEAKER_00]: the rhizos, whatever their root thing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Bush doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea what any of that shit did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, I'm just going to add
more and to start pouring more in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to press on this bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like where were you getting your
information?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, I didn't, I like, it was all
available and I was just dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I wasn't like, I was raised with
computers for playing fucking command and
[SPEAKER_00]: conquer and starcraft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I didn't know that you could like
seek out information on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like I was in that generation that
was right on the cusp, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like there was a lot of elements of
how people older than me like grew up and
[SPEAKER_00]: went to school, like looking up shit in
the library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, cause like they wouldn't let you
use sources from online yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you had to go and look up books and
check them out and like write the
[SPEAKER_00]: bibliography by hand and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like we had computer class on just
like computer literacy, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then by the time I graduated high
school, they were on like iPhone two and
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook was out and you know,
and so like I was in that weird generation
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of had like the full nineties
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also like the full like a 20
teens and being an adult for all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you grew up fucking just raising sheep
and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I remember the first student in high
school that had a cell phone at my high
[SPEAKER_04]: school.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there was one guy that had a cell
phone and it was like this big.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to pay him 10 bucks to use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you wanted to use it from school,
but like that guy was like a gangster,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like the one dude that had the
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in like middle school for like my
space and the razor flip phone and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that was like the first time camera
phones were around and like people were
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Oh, look at this girl's titties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's like pixelated, like 200 by 200
pixel image.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I see a boob in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kids getting their like phone stolen
during P you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to steal those phones, dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I was a poor kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: At like a pretty affluent like city.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: In high school is a nice school for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you don't want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a total fucking loser.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like anyone that knew me was just like
such a fucking loner kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I had friends and stuff, but it was
all the other kids that didn't fit into a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain group.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we became the stoner kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And uh, um, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually I had a homie whose dad grew
some weed when we were in high school too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he had like a little indoor with like
two or three lights in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw it like one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, do you actually let
you see it as a kid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were some fucking deadhead types.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they also were like my first view into
like the actual culture behind the scene
[SPEAKER_00]: too, because like they were from that
whole touring deadhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they had both been on tour for,
I think like a couple of years at a time,
[SPEAKER_00]: like him and his wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And um, um, they were also like addicts of
other tour or ex addicts of other types,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were, they were a little looser
with the liquor cabinet and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, fucking letting us smoke weed
there and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's favorite parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like not even my homie's favorite
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had it so good, but acted like it was
so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a friend like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: His parents would let us do whatever the
fuck we wanted, but he acted, he was so
[SPEAKER_04]: spoiled.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just like, eh, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had another friend like that where we
actually partied the most and like his
[SPEAKER_00]: parents were like, they're really nice
people, but like they, I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: why the fuck are you buying liquor for
like 16 year old kids?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just super overly permissive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like a broken person in your own
right for, for doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a chill dad, but I'm not going to be
buying fucking liquor for 16 year olds.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is that divide of like when you're,
when you're like 16, those kinds of dads
[SPEAKER_04]: are super cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, as you get older, you realize,
man, what a fucking delinquent,
[SPEAKER_04]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was his mom too, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so, it was a, it was a weird whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you pound her out?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not permissive.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she, she was like a really,
really nice lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was in kind of like a shitty marriage
and like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a whole backstory behind that
shit that I was like only kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: recognized more as an adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh, that was fucked up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, while you're looking back at this
point, like, you know, you mentioned to us
[SPEAKER_03]: that school was maybe not the easiest
environment for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but you know, you encountered like
your friend's parents and they had,
[SPEAKER_03]: they kind of like, you know, you got
introduced to this culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're looking back at it now,
do you, are you surprised that you came
[SPEAKER_03]: down this path?
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense to a certain degree,
but there's also like so many fork in the
[SPEAKER_00]: roads that like, or forks in the road that
I like, like have recognized looking back
[SPEAKER_00]: where I'm just like, Oh man, my life would
be so different if I had just like gone
[SPEAKER_00]: that way instead, you know, like my first
like real industry job for like a place
[SPEAKER_00]: that was quote unquote going legal,
you know, like I also had a, a lab manager
[SPEAKER_00]: position at a UC campus in a tissue
culture lab, like on the table ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, it's your job if you want
it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh, but I could make the
same amount of money, which was not
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like being a nursery manager for these
other guys in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was just more glamorous,
you know, and I was dumb and fucking,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, everyone in weed gets that main
character syndrome where they like think
[SPEAKER_00]: they're the same center of the fucking
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like with the circles that I ran in
for a long time, like it was, it was just
[SPEAKER_00]: bound to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's kind of like one of the
things that I talk about with the guys on
[SPEAKER_00]: the server is that it's just like,
you can become like a real piece of shit
[SPEAKER_00]: if you follow that rabbit hole far enough,
you know, cause there's more of them than
[SPEAKER_00]: there is good people in this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, there's always plenty of people
to shine your balls.
[SPEAKER_04]: There really are.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're willing to give people stuff
free or they're there, they have this
[SPEAKER_04]: impression that that you being your friend
will take them far.
[SPEAKER_04]: There will always be people in line to
tell you you're amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second you or someone comes along that
they feel is more advantageous or anything
[SPEAKER_04]: like that, you will get dropped like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's an experience I wish
everyone would experience because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: super humbling and it is some of the best
perspective to be, to really, really have
[SPEAKER_04]: your ego dropped hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was one of those idiots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went out to Oklahoma and tried to like
make it big because we thought we were so
[SPEAKER_00]: smart and like we got, we got out there
earlier than other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: This first year and a half, I was fucking
really good money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like we ate it hard after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really humbling because it was
like when you, when you're at the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: your game and you're making bank and
pulling those fucking multi-thousand pound
[SPEAKER_00]: grows off and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everyone wants to be your fucking
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sucking your dick and just like,
Oh, you're so fucking cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like, when you fall, like you
realize you have no fucking friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get to this like juicy bit,
tell me a bit more about your like earlier
[SPEAKER_03]: grows just to get us warmed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's so much more, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I did the grow with my buddy in my
hometown out in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then afterwards, the next season that
was like the two 15 era.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could just go into fucking
Sacramento by tray o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'd have like a bunch of clones
go right back out to your grow and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: them all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows if it was real or not,
but like I bought like 30 or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were like, well, we can do three,
let's do 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we plant them all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like wrote it till this patch and I
way over amend it with dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I literally take these clones from the
tray and I just stick them right into the
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt and it's open field and farm country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I leave for the weekend and he's
supposed to be taking care of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get back and he's like, Oh,
they all died.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but I didn't know anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was like fucking 20 years old
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I literally just took a clone and put
it in the soil outside and didn't think it
[SPEAKER_00]: would fucking die.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I had that same kind of logic.
[SPEAKER_04]: A green thumb to me was hard earned.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like nothing came natural to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I suck at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I've had to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's what's funny is that I like try
and do like, you know, be a mentor.
[SPEAKER_00]: To some of the younger guys to see coming
up in the industry and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people that want to make this their
life for some stupid fucking reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was at least glamorous when I
fucking got into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see what these young people see in
it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but I at least.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to talk about how you got from
that like early stage, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: towards like where you are now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, just give me, give me some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brother, I got plenty of stories to tell
you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then like I did my community college
thing as like, you know, high school
[SPEAKER_00]: dropout.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got all my transfer credits and shit
took way too fucking long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think by 22 or 23, I moved up to
Humboldt and then I stayed up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I transferred to Humboldt State and I did
some stupid shady shit with just like
[SPEAKER_00]: changing majors last minute once I got
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I'm in the botany program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I don't have any prereqs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I'm going to study botany and
went into that because I didn't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to do at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't like that into plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I knew I was into agriculture,
but like I didn't want to do all the work
[SPEAKER_00]: to get into like UC Davis or like Cal
Poly, because it's like you basically have
[SPEAKER_00]: to do like all your college like at the
community college.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just do your last year there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, what am I really going
to get out of that if I'm just spending
[SPEAKER_00]: like one year on campus actually learning
from these people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Supposed to be networking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still don't give a shit about
networking, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just wanted the info and like I
didn't, I wasn't savvy enough to just like
[SPEAKER_00]: go out and teach it to myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had just gardened like a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew those few plants, but like I was
not like horticulturally inclined at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I moved up to Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start the botany program and I got a job
at the Hydro shop up there in
[SPEAKER_00]: McKinleyville because that's where I was
living.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyone that's lived up there knows
North Coast Hydroponics, NHS, I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Steve Geerter and all those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of like my first intro
into like the real industry because like
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd lived in Humboldt for like six months
and I was like, there's no fucking weed
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what everybody's talking
about because like I wasn't in any
[SPEAKER_00]: circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was an outsider in the college town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I wasn't keyed into anything
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like getting into the Hydro shop,
really just like I learned what it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: really about, you know, what I mean and
started meeting some like actual growers
[SPEAKER_00]: and like people that did this for a
living.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, so fucking scary back
then as like an outsider.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just like, whoa, like that dude
just bought like fucking $20,000 worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and he paid for it in tens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to have run a money counter
like there on the register and just like
[SPEAKER_00]: blow through these fucking bricks of tens
to fucking that this guy gave you to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: for fucking soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember one time I questioned a
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, why is it all tens?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, money's fucking money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was a dumb question, like to someone
that just gave you $20,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a dumb ass question to be like,
why is it in tens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just so inexperienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I grew, I started slowly
piecing together like a little mini home
[SPEAKER_00]: grow set up, you know, and I like really
tiptoed my way into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I bought a little light and I
started growing house plants on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a four bold T five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got some stupid all in one
where like the ballast is like in this
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking metal housing with like a 400 watt
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just hot as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember I took all my student loan
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I would get this big chunk and I
lived with the girl that's now my wife up
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would give, I would get my student
loan money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would fucking pay the rent for like six
months just right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be like, this is rent money set aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had like 1500 bucks left.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just supposed to be like all my
living money for a few months for the
[SPEAKER_00]: semester, you know, and I took it and I
blew it all on fucking growing equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I, I think like, for those of you
who started on this so early, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: when you're so young, like going back to
what you were saying earlier, the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the feeling of power must be really
intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent, especially as like a
poor, fucking nobody that was like never
[SPEAKER_00]: popular and like never cool for any good
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you like start pumping out like
some decent weed even back then,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, yeah, you made a lot of friends once
again, like shallow ass friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, you see, you feel cool for
once, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is intoxicating and it ropes you
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start seeing other things
that are like a bigger version of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, well, I'm going to do
that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, I, I fucked around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew some like organic quote unquote
organic, like running some like roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole side story because I ended
up meeting that guy when I lived in
[SPEAKER_00]: Eugene, the guy that like founded that
company and shit and like shopped at his
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro shop and like talked to him pretty
regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another classic fucking guy in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just made a fuck ton of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he sold to some, some big
agrochemical company or to sunlight supply
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he just cashed out, but I grew actually
some really good weed at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just getting clones from HPRC,
which is like the, I think it's one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: oldest collectives in California that's
still running.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an Arcadia and it's like right around
the corner from this barber shop that my
[SPEAKER_00]: wife used to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where a lot of people got the train
wreck cut from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got quite a few clones from
there that like looking back and like
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing the same thing later on,
I was like, oh, that was the real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I didn't question provenance because
like in humble to that point cuts were
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty free flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in like the mid 20 teens,
like you could just ask for it then I grew
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like when I first fell in love
with blue dream and that's way after its
[SPEAKER_00]: era ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it had already like midst itself out
of oblivion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 2010, it was already like a wrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is like 2015, 14, 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I started growing it and I was
bringing it back down to the Sacramento
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like we were selling like 250,
$300 ounces of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like people were already a little
nostalgic about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, just like really good
small batch blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I didn't know that at the time I
thought we were just the best growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we had it all figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just add a little bit more Buddha,
Buddha bloom and it's all Gucci.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so fucking dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm working at this hydro shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing my little fucking one lighter,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: 600 watt tent and I'm fucking the whole
thing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every time I go away from blue dream,
I fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I grew Bubba once and I harvested it
like fucking 50 days and it was just like
[SPEAKER_00]: a larve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it wasn't that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was worse ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even blue dream, I was taking way too
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was taking it at like 56 and little did
I know I could have gotten, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like 30% more yield, getting it,
letting it go those last few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just no fucking clue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really blue dream though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you can get it really early and
you're growing it real well, it can come
[SPEAKER_04]: out super berry and it's so nice when it
gets the berry notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I even liked the high from early blue
dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas I also liked the high a lot from
like a 10 week blue dream, but like the
[SPEAKER_04]: berry flavors are all there at seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what I noticed too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, it looks full and it
smells amazing and it's coated in resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm just going to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how much more is it going to get by
day 56 or 63?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you have no fucking idea
how this actually works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm getting like three quarter
pound a light and I'm like, fuck yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: crushing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a few more days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I ended up meeting this dude that
became my like business partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I worked for him for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the end I was like one of his
business partners and he brought me into
[SPEAKER_00]: work on his like working out of a clone
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was just like a condo in one of
the towns up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, like two sides and one a
dude lived in one and had a bedroom,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was like a mom room in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the whole other side was just
like mom rooms and fucking a clone racks
[SPEAKER_00]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I think I was making like $15 an
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like cutting clones in this illegal clone
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they pumped them out, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, they were just feeding guys on
the Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, I think we had OG sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had this cut that the monk called
platinum Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to you about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just some unknown baby shit smelling
resin coated, super easy to grow plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm never going to see again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few, and the girl scout,
because that had like just started
[SPEAKER_00]: trickling through more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, I was for sure the forum
cut looking back on it now, but it was so,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was actually a really nice
cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Easy to grow again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's why we have so many seed
makers using cookie stuff, because anybody
[SPEAKER_04]: can make crosses of stuff and it looks
like cookies and it's all super easy to
grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody looks like a pro,
you know, and everyone says it's low
[SPEAKER_00]: yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, well, that tells me you
fucked it up because you gave it full
[SPEAKER_00]: strength light, full strength newts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it still looks beautiful and it still
smokes good, but the yield is like half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's, it was still nice though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that would be like, that's why I
never knew about like the hype era of cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: while I was up there is that like everyone
I worked with and knew was just like
[SPEAKER_00]: wholesalers and like, like wholesale
farmers and like they were selling shit
[SPEAKER_00]: that had to go back East.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like they would have their gardens,
like when they would sell their clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we would sell clones of them,
it would be like half OG half sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe like they would save like
10 or 15% for the cookies, just to like
[SPEAKER_00]: feed that local California Bay area market
and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, it wasn't a big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, it was just another offering
that people would put like at most like
[SPEAKER_00]: 30% of their garden, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I never really thought that much of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like another cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that there was this like,
wave of shit happening down in the Bay
[SPEAKER_00]: that would like dictate the industry till
today, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know about other OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that there was like other
versions of cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was just one OG Kush and
the crew that I ran with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen it again since.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they called it a Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I pressed at some point,
I heard it was a Florida OG and that's all
[SPEAKER_00]: I ever learned about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe Florida, I've never actually
seen that like verified and in flower in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, great sour cut, a good headband,
which was probably the Loompas when I
[SPEAKER_00]: think back on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when I had them all side by side,
I remember thinking that it looked like a
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect halfway point between the sour and
the OG we had.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, it's like a cam OG or sour OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just right down the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big yielding, big colas.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does the leaf cannibalism thing that
Cam Nutty one does too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always kind of looked like shit on
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: On like not good farmers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even on the best runs, it didn't
really look amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just something that threw down like
colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got you weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potent too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sold, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just one of those things that it
was just like, Oh, if I grow a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred pounds of this, like I have a guy
that'll buy that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which lines did you take to yourself
personally in that period?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew a lot of the cookies too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a chocolate hash berry cut that we
grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's from that, that dude,
purple caper or whatever down in the Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember it fondly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a chocolatey strawberry type
nose, really easy to grow, like purple
[SPEAKER_00]: frosty weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made great hash, but it just smelled
like chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as it aged in the bag, like it was
just like, what does that smell like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyone you put it up to would be like,
Oh, that's chocolatey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like milk chocolate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like milk chocolatey.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really nice, but like a milk
chocolate strawberry, like blended
[SPEAKER_00]: smoothie or like a milkshake kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like what I got from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I actually really liked three
Kings when it was going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an OG sour headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how it was mashed together in
what way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anyone does, but it was
fucking fire and it was way easier to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: than any of its three components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could pass it as like a few,
you know, you could pass it as a headband
[SPEAKER_00]: or a sour type kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was way easier to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I actually really missed that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the things that I've like
wanted to pitch to certain people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: crew to be like, Hey, you want to remake
this for me?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I just don't think like,
if it was remade, what I, what it reminds
[SPEAKER_04]: me of some of the stuff, elite genetics
released, not cannabis, but elite genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of that stuff was not quite what he
said, but some of it was so fucking dank
[SPEAKER_04]: that nobody really cared, you know,
just cause it was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That cut does still go around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll keep an eye out for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was a good cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a really good cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: One year I brought it to the done cup for
an OG entry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it was, it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really liked that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't like a, I couldn't get anyone
else to fucking grow it around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I was trying to sell clones of it
and I was like, this is like not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, while I was working for the
clone guys, like we did this whole thing
[SPEAKER_00]: where like we had more orders than we
could fill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started cropping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them franchises and like,
we would just like set up in another
[SPEAKER_00]: person's house and their gross set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as you sold them to the guy I
worked for, you know, he would cut you in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like five out of the $8 a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he would take the other three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was a great way to just like
move bulk cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't have your own market,
but you could set up a clone room for like
[SPEAKER_00]: 800 bucks, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I remember one year or one,
one month in particular, I fucking blew
[SPEAKER_00]: out like 10 G's worth of clones out of my
fucking back bedroom while I was in
[SPEAKER_00]: college, like full time student working at
the clone house, doing all the things like
[SPEAKER_00]: taking whatever work I could pick up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like it's fucking broken supporting
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up pulling together like 10
grand in a single month just from selling
[SPEAKER_00]: trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was fucking epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hooked like instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like, Oh, this is the type of
money you can make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even like selling clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, if I had a buyer for clones and
brought them to like the guys I worked
[SPEAKER_00]: with, they were like, Oh yeah,
I'll fill that 300 clone order and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: give you two bucks a cut, you know,
to just like do the sale and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, you could literally take an
hour, go load up some clones and drive
[SPEAKER_00]: them across town and make like a thousand
dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was just easy money for me back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I got into that whole lifestyle,
just like easy, come easy, go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you just start blowing money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what everyone around you does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, like bought a bunch of cool
guns and like bought a bunch of fucking,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, bought a nice truck eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all the stupid shit that you waste
money on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Oh, trust me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know high on lonesome calls in my boner
toys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing with your boner toys?
[SPEAKER_00]: One side question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that reversal bottle so fucking
black on your desk there?
[SPEAKER_04]: So because these are super concentrated,
it's not like ready to spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I've learned is over time,
the plastic bond or the silver bonds to
[SPEAKER_04]: the plastic to some degree.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I always like account for it,
but yeah, what's weird is they can be
[SPEAKER_04]: sitting next to each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could have two bottles sitting next to
each other, the same temperature for a
[SPEAKER_04]: month.
[SPEAKER_04]: One will do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: One won't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so bizarre to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a highly constant.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like a thousand X bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That explains it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was, I've been looking at it while
we've been talking and I'm just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of my sprays are so highly
concentrate like with silver that this
[SPEAKER_04]: isn't uncommon to see it super dark like
this, even in the normal ones,
[SPEAKER_04]: but this is a thousand X.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got accustomed to that lifestyle,
accustomed to just having cash in my
[SPEAKER_00]: pocket and like fucking being like,
like even just being like middle-class as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as like, like 60 grand a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made me feel fucking rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is like what your early twenties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still in like my mid twenties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think I'm like 24, 25 by this
point, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like we did that for a few years
while I was in school, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and like I would help out on outdoor
farms, like just being extra laborers,
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking digging holes, being a water boy,
as Caleb calls it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, yeah, man, like just fucking
putting in my dues, just trying to make
[SPEAKER_00]: money and meet people and like get
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I did like, uh, I had a friend
who was like building a legal grow because
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt County legalized before the state
did like the year before, cause they kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of saw the writing on the wall that like
the state's going to legalize soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, well, we're going to get
the county licensed ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're ahead of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it like puts all everyone at like an
advantage over the rest of the state that
[SPEAKER_00]: like, we already have county
authorization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now all you have to do is do your state
paperwork, get your licensing and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't fucking work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't work out that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it basically made everyone dry snitch
on themselves and just like, or just not
[SPEAKER_00]: even dry fucking full on to snitch
yourself out to the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you didn't register your illegal
grow with the county by a certain date,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would never give you a license on
that property ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically most people that like
wanted to go legal went and outed
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves to the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're just like a map,
a dot on a map that they like know to fly
[SPEAKER_00]: over, know to fucking check in on,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it kind of put all those people,
it like expedited the slow, like exodus of
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers from that whole area, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like a deep irony to that,
isn't there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well that's honestly like the industry
in a nutshell is all the people that like
[SPEAKER_00]: went above and beyond, um, like kind of
got fucked early on, especially the
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller mom and pop grows that were like,
we want to do this right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to come out of the shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they kind of all got made an example
of by like people like fish and game and
[SPEAKER_00]: the water board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, um, a lot of people are going to
say, you know, they didn't want people in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, you got to move your farm to
the fucking bottom lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, bro, you know how expensive
that is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some small farmers living in a cabin
off grid and humble, they're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to fucking do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I was going to say like,
if this were a movie, I imagine that would
[SPEAKER_03]: be a point of like serious foreshadowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be like the ominous moment of
everybody like reluctantly coming up and
[SPEAKER_00]: putting their name on the fucking ledger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that it's just like,
you're on the fucking list now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was just like bad times up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like my buddy that was building
this legal grow for these rich dudes out
[SPEAKER_00]: of LA and that whole thing ended up
falling apart after like a few months,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like I worked there for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut clones for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and just like did my whole thing that
I was already doing just like nursery
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I wrote, I ended up writing a like
ag management contract for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I didn't know anything about how
to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like went online and like pulled
some contracts together, found some other
[SPEAKER_00]: like publicly listed contracts that like
real ag companies use and kind of just
[SPEAKER_00]: like hodgepodge together this like ag
management contract for him to present to
[SPEAKER_00]: these people that he was like building
this farm for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it caught the attention of this
one dude that I ended up working for who
[SPEAKER_00]: is doing all their compliance work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this is my homie, Jason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason's still out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to that dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking working his ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a, runs a private consulting company
with these people and humble helping out
[SPEAKER_00]: weed grows all over the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fucking Jason, you're still my boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Jason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got me my first like real gig in the
industry that wasn't just like water boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking clone cutter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, all that, all those kind of lower tier
jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got me a gig managing the nursery
work, um, for this group, um, down in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they want to be named or
not, but they're, they're a current legal
[SPEAKER_00]: brand now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not like a huge one, but you know,
like known and, um, they had just fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors all over LA, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a few dispensaries,
like they were these like kind of older
[SPEAKER_00]: dudes that I think they had set up one of
the first dispensaries and, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: the San Fernando Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like they had, they had money,
you know, and they had these big ass
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors all over LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I think the smallest one I think
was like over a hundred lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and then the larger ones were
like two to 400 lights and, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, maybe two to 300
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, that was like my first time,
like operating at scale and like a more
[SPEAKER_00]: management type position where it's just
like, I got all their genetics in check
[SPEAKER_00]: cause they were having a lot of bug and
infestation issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just went in there with a little
TC tech started washing plants and bleach
[SPEAKER_00]: before I cloned them out to kill all the
mites, kill all the aphids and all that
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit, like get a system together to
like clean up the clones and the mons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then like, we can cycle out all the
rooms and start filling them with clean
[SPEAKER_00]: clones instead of all these rude aphids
and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just like help them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were like a serious pro by this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like, and how old were you
again?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, I was like fake it till you make it
pro, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was dropped way in over my head and
they were like, we need help.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, if you can do it, go for it,
you know, the whole industry, like
[SPEAKER_04]: realistically, when, when commercial came
about, think about how many of us like
[SPEAKER_04]: really knew how to run more than 20
lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some, but not enough to fill up
all the grows through Oklahoma,
[SPEAKER_04]: Michigan, like all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So realistically, there were a lot of
people that had to stick up their hands
[SPEAKER_04]: and just have the faith in themselves to
get this done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of them couldn't, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just following in the footsteps of
the guys I saw in Humboldt and I like
[SPEAKER_00]: stole their recipes and are not stole.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I already had them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd given them to me, but just like use
their recipe, try and modify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were trying to do a bunch of a led
grows with like the first gen fluent
[SPEAKER_00]: spiders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were like pretty challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like, I didn't really understand
like what cannabis wanted for like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, PPFD or like how many micro
moles of light, you know, coming down on
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canopy that it actually wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like the, the old Gavita six,
seven fifties, they're all, you're only
[SPEAKER_00]: getting like 400 at canopy height,
way less by the time you hit the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, there was a lot of older cuts
that still like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Bubba and OG, they like that range
still, you know, from everything that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen with our experimentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like those like make a new comment
here, which is that you constantly hear
[SPEAKER_03]: people say that like there is a target
there's just like a PPFD.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like a magic number, like a
thousand for all plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my experience has really strained
against that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever I've tried to do that,
some of my plants have just suffered
[SPEAKER_03]: really intensely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was just really nice to hear someone
just be explicit and just say like,
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously some plants are not going to
enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it at scale in a million
different ways now that like certain
[SPEAKER_00]: plants do not want like a modern amount of
light as far as like how grow rooms are
[SPEAKER_00]: set up and just grid it out with luxe
thousand watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants don't respond well to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want the three OEC from Athena.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually makes them larvier and like
shittier overall than it ever even does
[SPEAKER_00]: like dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I saw Bubba recently grown like that
and it was larfy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had it at a different facility
in a different whole different setup and
[SPEAKER_00]: circumstance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like it was shaded out by this canopy
and I was doing this breeding project and
[SPEAKER_00]: it came through so fucking nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was so fucking perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, dude, it doesn't want any
light at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you guys heard of Bruce, Bruce Bugby?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's his name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds familiar.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like this kind of academic,
I believe, who kind of got big on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the main things he's known for
is kind of like trying to tell people that
[SPEAKER_03]: there is this one DLI, this one PPFD
number that you should always hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like with anything in growing,
people are just like, yeah, that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: answer now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got actually some good anecdotal,
like just a good anecdote about this is
[SPEAKER_00]: that like I've met quite a few like PhD
students and stuff that are like doing
[SPEAKER_00]: research in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've talked with some of these people
and they have all these claims and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: make claims like, oh, freeze drying
doesn't affect the quality of the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, well, did you smoke it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in all measurable ways, it's
identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, yeah, but you didn't
fucking smoke it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's literally the only point of all of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you like negated that whole thing
because it's not proper or measurable in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way that you can like make, like make and
show is statistically relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's like literally the whole goal
is to have it be enjoyable smoke and have
[SPEAKER_00]: the consumer want to buy it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the fuck are you telling me that
you did the research and you didn't do the
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing that everyone's going to do with
the product that you're presenting me?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, yeah, go fuck yourself
where it's like, I guess, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in science, like you construct the model
and then you make hypotheses based on that
[SPEAKER_03]: model.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then later on, you actually need to
check the fit of the model to reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even see junkie.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just posted on this the other day on IG
about like what's like trying to like set
[SPEAKER_00]: up a debate about pros and cons of freeze
drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, bro, you trying to outsource
your thinking to the fucking public?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's been getting shopped or
someone's been shopping for fucking freeze
[SPEAKER_00]: dryers recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't know what call to make,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, man, there is no magic quantity
of fertilizer in any quantity or like
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no magic DLI that all plants are
all strains want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're all if you think like that,
you've only been growing since the modern
[SPEAKER_00]: kickoff of everything being fucking the
same because like gelato hybrids don't
[SPEAKER_00]: mind those high deal eyes and fucking high
EC feeds at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will give you more weight and like a
real expression and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's easy when you have a plant
that like you give more gas and it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like some plants don't fucking respond
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that's the way they acclimated to
commercial growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was selected under those pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I always tell people is
that like, bro, OG doesn't want this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was selected in the fucking 90s under a
600 watt adjust a wing in like an 85
[SPEAKER_00]: degree fucking room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone will be at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone babied the shit out of it to get
the expression that they wanted from it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how it was selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, that's obviously what it
fucking prefers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whenever people tell me they're not
getting the OG expression they want,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I don't know, throw it in some
fucking black gold potting soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: feed it some diner grow or some cutting
edge and just leave it the fuck alone and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't touch it and don't try and add any
like magic sauce to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like give it the bare minimum and it'll
come through for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody believes me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it just takes time with a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when people ask me when you select a
male, like what are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, like how you answer that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you really know how it's done,
like depends on the project, but people
[SPEAKER_04]: want solid answers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you give them something more open
ended, they'll go to someone else to get a
[SPEAKER_04]: solid answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, before we get too off topic,
I got more stories to tell me and I got a
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like 27 when I'm in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I turned 27 out there because I,
uh, I moved in January.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so I'm working with these guys at
this just like Epic scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making good money, not for LA though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was paying like fucking three grand
a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to ask you what your mindset
was at this point as like a young man,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, Oh, I'm going to get rich and famous
growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like I, I had so many job offers by
that point, just because I was working in
[SPEAKER_00]: a place and was like publicly advertising
that I like did cannabis at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting job offers fucking
constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had people wanting me to like move to
fucking Columbia at that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause things were just kicking off down
there, which is like a total fucking scam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had Canna bros from fucking Canada
coming down with their fucking funny
[SPEAKER_00]: money, offering me a bajillion dollars in
stock and like 60 grand a year to come
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking move to Panama and like manage
their grows worldwide and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like company didn't exist like eight
months later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like so many fucking pump and dump schemes
going on at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, um, I was just like honing the
blades, but I had a big old fucking ego
[SPEAKER_00]: just that like, Oh, I've made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be fucking rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be this famous fucking weed
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all these bros I see on IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like, I had just discovered like the
jungle boys and like at that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: like symbiotic genetics was really big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like purple punch was making the
rounds of banana punch and all those,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I actually popped those seeds when I
first moved there to LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, I bought these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys want to grow them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, yeah, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I found it like such in one pack,
I found such a nice cut of mimosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I still have pics of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can post it up on the server,
but, um, just like gorgeous purple weed
[SPEAKER_00]: coated in resin smelled like grape candy
and tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like, it was like a perfect
middle of the road between purple punch
[SPEAKER_00]: and tangy or whatever he used in that
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, um, yeah, I was just kind of like
fumbling my way through like modern
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I met so many people down there at
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That were just trying to like hand me
fucking clones of so much shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had no idea what I had on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all the shit that all the modern bros
would just like fucking die for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it was just all around and I
didn't know any better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they had so many old different cuts
of OG from NorCal and like, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I don't know a bunch of stuff that I'm
still not that keen on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, what's that fucking cut called?
[SPEAKER_00]: The star fighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a buddy that had like the star
fighter, all those star fighter cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, he actually had like a ton of
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried to reconnect with this one
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause he was a, he was like the first
genetics nerd that I ever really met.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was this dude, Jimmy down
there and he was one of the growers for
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, he brought in so many gorgeous
fucking cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was totally up to date on all the seed
junkie shit and was like growing gelato
[SPEAKER_00]: packs that like seed junkie had really
released and like, uh, um, cause I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty sure he released a line called G
33, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember that, Matt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did see junkie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't, didn't he take those cuts and like
work them somehow and just release it as
[SPEAKER_00]: though he very well could have,
I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to put that on him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that dude gets enough shit as it is,
but yeah, he works with pigs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you didn't listen to first smoke of
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cover all that, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to turn that shit off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was just like, do I really want to
listen to these dudes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just suck these guys fucking dicks for an
hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just product placement fucking
podcast though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like literally here to promote a
brand, promote a guy, build the hype.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, that's what high times was,
and it was successful for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's paid advertisement in the
form of a magazine that people think isn't
[SPEAKER_04]: paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that's why like some people
think that this podcast is this giant like
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue creator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, sorry to bring it to you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, this is a passion project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned in this industry,
like real information does not pay the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like hype fucking lies and just like
renames that pays the fucking bills.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, being where you're at and I mean,
you understand you've had the journey of
[SPEAKER_04]: the smoke and mirrors and maybe you could
talk about like through your stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a story about like one of
those experiences early on when you first
[SPEAKER_04]: started seeing some of the smoke clear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was too dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was way too dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the smoke didn't clear for me until I
crashed and burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, and like, it literally like the
fire stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when the smoke cleared and I was
like, Oh, I've been a fucking idiot for
[SPEAKER_00]: like eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the LA guys were cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like, wasn't making enough money to
live down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like going into debt, working for
them kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were both working full-time jobs,
me and my wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, we weren't married yet,
but like, we were just like not doing well
[SPEAKER_00]: financially there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same guy I used to cut clones for
was like, yo, I'm working with this dude
[SPEAKER_00]: now and he's fucking blown up big time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, why don't you come grow outdoor for
us up in Oregon?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything to get me out of this shit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like I lived in East LA and silver
Lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: My apartment was fucking so expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just not the vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I came from fucking McKinleyville to
East LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like wearing car hearts and beat up
jeans and shitty clothes and just like
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking driving my old beater pickup and
like fucking everyone around me is just
[SPEAKER_00]: like BMW's mansions fucking like the
glamour of SoCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, I'm not into this
shit, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to see shows every weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go to fucking art exhibits
all night and like hang out with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't fucking know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I want to smoke weed and drink beer
and talk shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's all I really want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're doing that in the fog belt,
like that's just all the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, so I go up to fucking Eugene,
like on a fucking whim.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I met these dudes one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I flew up there to, they flew me up to
like make a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm like, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll run your fucking outdoor grow and
we're quote unquote growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the 2018 era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon legalized hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I basically hit every fucking like
douchey bro state and move.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done every single fucking one of
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I know so many people that did
though, like that's not uncommon for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I, everyone I knew was doing the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was just like, it seemed like
the move to make money and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you can't grow weed in the woods of
Humboldt anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they fucking, they're just flying
like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using GIS to like just
automatically find the fucking weed farms
[SPEAKER_00]: with a computer and automatically send
notices to your fucking gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like you're in $10,000 a day fine
for you not being in compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the writing was on the wall for me,
you know, there were still a few years
[SPEAKER_00]: that people managed to make it work,
but like I kind of moved on and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, we did the whole thing out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just, Eugene was fucking
scandalous times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like the beginning of the end
ultimately, but I didn't know it cause it
[SPEAKER_00]: was still a few years out, but like
working for those guys, it was just like
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking big time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work fully illegal, fully black market,
like, you know, interstate shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like it was, it was big time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I'll not, I'll spare the details
on this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I don't think that, uh, that a
statute of limitations is up, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, um, but like we got flown so fucking
hard, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I cut down an acre of hoops and like
fucking one, one afternoon and transported
[SPEAKER_00]: it all to the separate facility to fucking
dry it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, we pulled off this fucking like,
I dunno, it was like a meager,
[SPEAKER_00]: like 1200 pound fucking season,
but it should have been like fucking like
[SPEAKER_00]: 4,000 pounds if we had actually let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, you know, when you've got a heli,
a blacked out helicopter with a giant
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking camera flying 50 feet over your
greenhouses, ripping skins off of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know that the, it's,
it's just a matter of time before they
[SPEAKER_00]: come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll harvest 10 or 14 days early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give a shit getting something's
better than nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, uh, we did all right that
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality was like not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of like the beginning of my
decline in growing good weed and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of just being like a mids guy that
just like grew at massive scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we took all that money from
fucking Oregon and, uh, some other shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause sorry, ice cream cake, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck tons of ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know if anyone else caught it,
but I was talking to local on one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: channels and, and uh, we had our long lost
plug connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like, uh, uh, we used to supply a
lot of shit out to where he's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I was like, Oh, did it look like
this when it came?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, they all came like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, it's cause we,
we made all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like long last plug connections,
you know, like, yeah, it comes to weed
[SPEAKER_04]: movement, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, especially when like you're with
like people and like, I wasn't in this
[SPEAKER_00]: side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like a guy that grew a flower,
you know, they had this whole other oil
[SPEAKER_00]: side of it, but like, bro, they were
pumping out fucking weight, like flooding
[SPEAKER_00]: cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, they were doing some serious
fucking work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, um, we took a bunch of money
and I knew some guys out in Oklahoma that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd met in LA previously because like
through some fucking weird thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, one of the guys that was a grower in
LA, he, they, they was, those were all
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican dudes, right down in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was this whole Mexican family,
a bunch of dudes in the family worked for
[SPEAKER_00]: him growing and doing different things for
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, one of them, when they first came
over, um, for Mexico, they landed in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, he knew some dudes from school
that were, um, this one dude drew and this
[SPEAKER_00]: one dude Pedro, and they all knew each
other from school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, uh, they were coming out to LA
to see how weeds grown at like scale so
[SPEAKER_00]: they could set up their own legal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like Oklahoma was about to like vote
in medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were getting all their ducks
in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they were like smart ass fucking 20
year old kids, man, like 21 year old guys
[SPEAKER_00]: just like scrape together 50 grand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, we're going to start
growing weed, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, they're still operating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They run this company called high rise
cannabis out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're honestly, I think the best growers
in Oklahoma, they're fucking like they're
[SPEAKER_00]: bad-ass guys and they, they have their
local dispensary and they'd make their own
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, they're one of the few examples
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few more like resident coal and
a few others, but like, um, high rise and
[SPEAKER_00]: those dudes, they're fucking super legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're ever passing through,
definitely stop at their dispensary and
[SPEAKER_00]: Bethany, cause they'll hook you up with
some fucking fire for cheap too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're, they're still some of the
guys from out there that I've like made
[SPEAKER_00]: friends with in the industry that like
they, they stuck by me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were fucking solid dudes,
um, trying to help me out all the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, I haven't talked to them for a
minute, but fucking shout out drew and
[SPEAKER_00]: Pedro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so they kind of tipped us off
about Oklahoma because I was still talking
[SPEAKER_00]: with them and he would hit me up for just
like little questions here and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Oh, how do you do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what's your dilution for this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just like little mentor type
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, Hey, I'm trying to figure out
how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I kind of just coach them along
the way, just giving them little bits of
[SPEAKER_00]: help here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just fucking ran with it and came
some bad asses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but they tipped us off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go out there just like fucking first
boots on the ground, take a, fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: flight out there with a fucking bag of
money, start renting houses for the crew,
[SPEAKER_00]: find a property to buy, like set up this
whole fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, uh, I'll leave out all the
fucking details of that one, but it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: like the whole thing fucking blew up huge
in my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, um, you know, I ended up holding
some assets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the fucking property sale I've
been talking with you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and like, didn't get totally fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it, did it get off the ground before
blowing up or did it kind of go up like on
[SPEAKER_00]: that first year, man, weed was worth so
much fucking money in Oklahoma that first
[SPEAKER_00]: summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause nobody, everybody had set up some
like pretty small indoors and was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like slowly growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I set up a 12 lighter next grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to double it all back in set up
24.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's what Drew and Pedro did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they fucking made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They filled that warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I think they have like 150,
200 lights and they're this nice
[SPEAKER_00]: self-sustaining unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but like we just went out there and
blew it out immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like from the first 10 weeks I started
building, like I started with a raw piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of dirt and within 10 weeks I had a
greenhouse lit up with fucking Gavita is
[SPEAKER_00]: filled with plants, like fucking ready to
roll flowering, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, we made really good money that
first year, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was selling some light debt wedding cake
pounds for fucking 16 to 1800 each and
[SPEAKER_00]: like people lining up to buy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the weeds sold itself that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I made great money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was a fucking brutal season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like one of my first like full
start to finish outdoors at scale besides
[SPEAKER_00]: like Oregon, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, I had a pretty big learning
curve of just like not being the most
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced outdoor guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still not really done it a bit,
but like, you know, um, I fucked my shit
[SPEAKER_00]: up this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had that surgery right once in
the beginning of August.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my fucking outdoor came out like
absolute trash bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it started getting care in like week
six, you know, before that it was just
[SPEAKER_00]: like straight water from my wife,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had that long ass recovery,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Better love like shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, my energy levels are just like zapped,
you know, how long that's supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had another buddy who, um, that I work
with now, he had a kidney that just like
[SPEAKER_00]: ruptured for some weird reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a birth defect and a blockage
and, um, he had the same exact surgery
[SPEAKER_00]: just to remove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, I donated mine for context to
the people listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, he told me it was about six
months and that's what the doctor say too
[SPEAKER_00]: is like, you're going to just feel weird
and off and like not a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you'll start feeling more normal
around six months in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like your kidney, your other kidney
literally has to like swell up and grow
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger to accommodate the workload.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That can't feel good either.
[SPEAKER_04]: That cannot be a fun feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like a lot of expenditure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's like a kidney is like,
you know, like a filtering vessel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just like packed full of like
really thin capillaries and vasculature
[SPEAKER_00]: and like it literally has to enlarge
itself at like where it normally never
[SPEAKER_00]: would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like supposedly like I'll go from
like, you know, 50% kidney function
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately after surgery or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should go up to about like 80% by
the time I'm healed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maximum though is 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the high end of what the,
what the, what they expect your single
[SPEAKER_04]: kidney after donations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, you're a brave dude for doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I, I'm sure we didn't mean to more
dumb, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I just, I just wanted to say that
though, it was a really brave thing to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like a lot of people talk about it,
but like sitting down, going under the
[SPEAKER_04]: knife to donate part of your organs and
knowing that it's going to affect your
[SPEAKER_04]: life in a certain way, the rest of your
life, that that's, that's brave.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I applaud you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I appreciate it dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it was fucking scary, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you like, you don't know what
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had this crazy health
screening and so like I was perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was like absolutely nothing
wrong with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like, I have a thing that
brings me back to the doctor once a year
[SPEAKER_00]: for the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's not like there was no
cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like people can live perfectly fine
on one kidney, but it's just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it came at a pretty big cost to like my
personal life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, like my, my like,
uh, work distribution that I do with my
[SPEAKER_00]: wife with a kid and shit and like,
cause she had to just take over for like
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking, you know, almost over a month,
you know, where she's just like basically
[SPEAKER_00]: a single mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's me just fucking out of my mind
on opiates and weed, fucking laying on the
[SPEAKER_00]: couch, watching another episode of fucking
kitchen nightmares.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking raw.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking raw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love watching that dude yell at people
and throw food across the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that Gordon Ramsey?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hella dramatic.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's so funny, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those garbage TVs that I'm
like fully invested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want his beef Wellington,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: For real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen that meme that Endo made of
Matt with Matt's Gordon Ramsey?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's doing the idiot, the idiot
sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oh yeah, that one's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one is so good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like a week on that fucking BS
memes channel that was just like pure
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking gold from Endo where I was just
like, dude, just keep pumping them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm getting so much enjoyment out of
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the last two days has been pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some liberty to an otherwise pretty heavy
couple of days.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That late one that I slapped together for
you and booze, I was like, I wish I hadn't
[SPEAKER_00]: missed the moment because this would
fucking land if you're like your comment
[SPEAKER_03]: was still like in view.
[SPEAKER_03]: For context, Dan is making fun of me and
booze and our accents and affiliation with
[SPEAKER_03]: sheep and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just the way that you said it,
you were like we were we were so much
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler and nicer and smarter than those
Australian settlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like says the man that wasn't colonized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I love when white dudes start
comparing like colonizer debt to like
[SPEAKER_00]: where they live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like, we're all fucked and we're
all from the British like and we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking weird because of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like once I started learning about like
weird British nuances of like religion and
[SPEAKER_00]: culture and stuff, I'm like, oh,
the whole white world makes sense to me
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were like, you guys may be like prison
colonies and all that shit, but like we
[SPEAKER_00]: were the weirdest religious people out of
Britain.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, we're going to go make our
own fucking country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that like sums up America in a
nutshell, you know, why we have all this
[SPEAKER_00]: evangelical Christian nonsense and just
like a million different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: Christianity that are all like so
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God, guys, let's not go here for
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting controversial on this topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, I agree that all these all
these colonies are just like weird
[SPEAKER_03]: quarantine mutations of British culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: One hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had to like genuinely look up famous
people from New Zealand because I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, I know, like Lordy, but that's
not going to land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I found out that I was like,
oh, like fucking Russell Crowe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I found out he's a fucking
kiwi romper romper, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, that's a controversy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have like a controversy.
[SPEAKER_03]: People get angry that you mentioned him
because he was like born in New Zealand,
[SPEAKER_03]: but he's living.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought he was an Aussie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for booze, I threw up a fucking image
of like Steve Irwin when he was young,
[SPEAKER_00]: like bottle feeding kangaroos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, obviously, that's how they all
live, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last side tangent on this note,
I was watching this fucking weird ass
[SPEAKER_00]: video on YouTube about like permaculture
in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just this dude in like super
short cut off jean shorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's just like this outback rancher
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every single scene of where
they're interviewing him, he's rolling a
[SPEAKER_00]: cigarette with his hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single fucking scene, he's either
smoking or rolling a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, it must be booze.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like the guy on Trailer Park Boys
who always has the scotch and coke or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got I've got too many things to say
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll keep it to the private chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we won't we won't start railing on
the accented whites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comments are going to start going on
railing on the religious cults.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it's why America is so cult prone,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big cult.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, like the timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma, like we're at twenty twenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twenty twenty one rolls in like fucking
the dude that owned all this shit starts
[SPEAKER_00]: getting real paranoid because like he's
rolling in like serious fucking money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like, yeah, really, really next
level life changing amount of money for
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone involved to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and the type that people get fucking
hurt over, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like he starts getting real paranoid
about me and shit and like that I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to fuck him over because he fucked over
this like guy that I really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still friends with.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a mentor of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like he's the one that fucked him
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I'd already started this out with
my boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we're cool because he will pay you
like that was the thing that everyone said
[SPEAKER_00]: about this dude is he pays his debts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He may be late.
[SPEAKER_00]: He may be a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he pays his fucking debts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, just wait, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a year late, but like you'll get
paid the money he owes you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like he fucking came through and he
did it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like the whole reason that we split
up and all that drama and all that
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit, like it never even needed to
happen because what he was paranoid about
[SPEAKER_00]: was that like I was going to fuck him to
get back at him for my boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, I'm not that petty,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, but that's that's to me,
that's more him projecting and showing his
[SPEAKER_04]: inner soul.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's where his mind is at,
that that would scare me to be real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, and it just like that was
the beginning of the end for him to was
[SPEAKER_00]: all that paranoia because like he started
making bad moves and doing shit with even
[SPEAKER_00]: shadier people than us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, he ended up getting
fucking murdered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a hard lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was like a dude that I like worked
with and talked to like every day for
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I didn't like him at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still don't think that he deserved
what he got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like he was still a family man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I've eaten dinner with his
fucking wife and kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now his kids have to grow up without a
dad just because of some stupid fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: funny money shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, that's going to happen a lot
to more as we see cannabis like the
[SPEAKER_04]: downfall.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see a lot of people whose characters we
thought were very sound kind of make
[SPEAKER_04]: decisions that are out of character.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And man, that's hard to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was enough money flowing
around that like we always made jokes of
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, this will be a fun part in the
movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's like that main character
syndrome bullshit that everyone gets
[SPEAKER_00]: caught in is just like we thought we were
the center of the fucking world,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because like I didn't know anyone as
big as us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they did, they kept their mouth
shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, yeah, man, it was just a
weird time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just like led to me doing like a
lot of like being a lot more introspective
[SPEAKER_00]: and just like having to like fucking eat
crow hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like I had to clean up that entire
mess, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like everyone dipped and I was just
like the one with my name on shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I had to stay and clean up and
like it took every fucking dollar out of
[SPEAKER_00]: my safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fucking like put my relationship on the
rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had my son and my son had just
been born.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like my wife was pregnant for this
whole last year of like bullshit and drama
[SPEAKER_00]: while everything's breaking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like the type of thing where it's
like, you know, it's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you still have to go through the
motions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that whole fall was just like,
yeah, we're going to grow weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not worth anything, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like we went from eight sixteen
to eighteen hundred dollars pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: wedding cake and shit to fucking six
hundred dollars pounds of the some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: best weed I've ever grown at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you see me post like debt photos,
it's from that last fall where it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: like fucking like really, really insanely
good quality because we just made the call
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're like, well, it's too hot here
during the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The summer run depth in Oklahoma is
fucking not even worth doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll all look like shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like waited till September to flip
the greenhouses September 1st and like
[SPEAKER_00]: some of it like the GMO went to like
fucking December 14th and still didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: People who call that cut 11 weeks had do
not know what finished weed looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to local about it and he's
like, oh, it's 13 by my estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And funny enough on the GMO topic,
the same dudes at high rise when they
[SPEAKER_00]: first started, they got this cut of GMO
and it was supposedly through some
[SPEAKER_00]: roundabout source directly from Skunk Tech
and like his selected just got Master
[SPEAKER_00]: Flex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Master Flex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a much shorter flowering way
nastier cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was like fucking cat piss and baby
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his warehouse for like two weeks,
even after he trimmed it, moved it out and
[SPEAKER_00]: sold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked into his warehouse and I was
like, dude, I can still fucking smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a nine week or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was much, much prettier,
like fucking dense cookie bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was the high?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like KMD style.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fucking great weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never seen it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dropped it because there was not that
much demand for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like they're much more like
modern hype boys and know how to play in
[SPEAKER_00]: that market and not like triple over their
dick and fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came from a staples era of like
wholesaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the people I came up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I like growing whole hoops of
one fucking cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's how it should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really experience it and see it in all of
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't dial it in if you're growing
fucking six cuts in every room or every
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse every exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're cycling through for the flavor
of the month and flavor of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you just never actually get
that true genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I don't want to say master a cut
because I don't think anybody's truly
[SPEAKER_04]: ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, maybe some people do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never have mastered anything that I
feel.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like there's no way you're going to
get to truly have that relationship with a
[SPEAKER_04]: cut where you get to grow it to its best
expression unless you're constantly
[SPEAKER_04]: growing at each round and learning it
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's acclimating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're acclimating to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I came back to California
after I cleaned up that whole fucking mess
[SPEAKER_00]: like last every dime I had drove back with
like my fucking dog in my truck and my
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking dog died out there, too,
like right when my son was born.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this dog I've had my whole adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like my business in one year,
my business failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dog got leukemia and died like my
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: For real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my I was drinking a lot at this
point, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: My relationship with like a dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this is only two, two and a half years
ago now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You must still be like recovering from
that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, 100 percent, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a therapist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, and I realize how fucked up I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like I've been like,
oh, that's not normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Six years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just I couldn't find someone that
was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I found someone my age and like
apparently I like talking to women more
[SPEAKER_00]: than fucking bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty typical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I found this great chick who I
fucking talk to like every two weeks to a
[SPEAKER_00]: month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like it's just nice to not have to
listen to someone else talk to you about
[SPEAKER_00]: their shit afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just like, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just help me with my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the call ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super selfish and I feel bad about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like I'm paying for this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to feel that bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, man, I've been starting to
talk a little bit about like mental health
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff and like taking care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, especially in in this world,
we were like mostly dudes who don't seem
[SPEAKER_03]: to know how to take care of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, worth shouting out, especially
in like Western culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you're supposed to be this like
fucking stoic, role with the punches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing bothers me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can overcome everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like it's a tiring face to put on
every day, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I just want to be like it's hard
to be vulnerable as like an American man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what you end up becoming is like a
brittle, like repressed mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, like he's got issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like anyone that tells you that
you have daddy issues like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably do, too, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's like I had someone try and
tell me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, you know, like I don't
have the best relationship with my dad,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, but I know he loves me and I care
about him, too, even though we're not like
[SPEAKER_00]: always on the same page or tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think that's it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's more just that like I've
never felt like I like belonged anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I was like so ready to like
hop on board with these people that like
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't in retrospect ever really treat me
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They paid me well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They let me feel slightly part of the crew
and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like it's that get like me game
that every husband counselor from every
[SPEAKER_00]: industry has is that it's just like,
oh, well, if you do what I'm doing and
[SPEAKER_00]: become my bitch, then like, yeah,
we can fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get like me and fucking be rich,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have all this glamorous lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like it's a classic hustle that I like
see everywhere now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to point out as well,
like what you were saying earlier,
[SPEAKER_03]: like most people, I believe all they want
is to be accepted and to fit in somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of the time people get
confused and they confuse that for like
[SPEAKER_03]: getting more power or like getting higher
up in a hierarchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, a lot of these people just
want to like feel like they belong,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I spent so long trying to
become this guy that made money and like
[SPEAKER_00]: was more like the people that I saw
because like they would full on tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, you're just weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't figured it out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you haven't fucking sold your soul
out enough to like be like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you just got to do this,
that and the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be so emotional, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't like tell the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I went down this whole rabbit
hole where like I've been spending the
[SPEAKER_00]: last two years just like trying to figure
out who like I actually am again as an
[SPEAKER_00]: adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've just been circling back all
the shit that like I liked doing when I
[SPEAKER_00]: was younger and like when times were good,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I've just been playing a lot
of guitar and like spending time with my
[SPEAKER_00]: kid, trying to be like the dad that I
didn't have kind of grown up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like being available and around
and just like not not that stereotypical
[SPEAKER_00]: hard ass dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just trying to grow better weed again
for once.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you can feel glamorous growing
fucking a thousand or a couple thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like I've realized that I
suck at growing weed now, as far as like
[SPEAKER_00]: my home setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, God, I fucked up the last like three
runs in a row, you know, because like I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not used to not having my toys in my setup
and like, you know, like home growing is a
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different skill set than
commercial growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually, I think, much more
challenging because you have such unideal
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions in certain ways, depending on
how you built it, where you're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like where I'm at, it's just the heat
during the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like once the heat's off,
it's fucking cold, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like you're going from running
AC to fucking running heaters inside your
[SPEAKER_00]: tent kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and like I've just had a bitch
of a time controlling my environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've fucked up a bunch of runs now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've learned from a bunch of runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's the whole thing is that it's
just like, I'm realizing more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: that I got lucky when I was younger home
growing and I had some easy to grow cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wish I still had.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like the other day, you know,
like I'm growing some testers right now
[SPEAKER_00]: and like I sprayed some Dr. Zynes at the
fucking four ounce a gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my plants are all fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little seedlings got fucking fried,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this these small?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're still they're teens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're all like eight inches
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to grow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for whatever reason, those genetics
just got like fried by the Dr. Zynes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really like Dr. Zynes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I remember when it came out and I was
working at the Hydra shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never really liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nukem is a better product if we're
plugging specific shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Nukem a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make my mistakes and buy Dr. Zynes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy Nukem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that in the server as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is quite a random interjection.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I was saying this to Matt like
yesterday, maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I met Farmer Dan on the server,
I think I had no idea that you had all the
[SPEAKER_03]: all of this experience behind you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't either.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember we just had some like quite
like nice talks in like just the DMs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't I didn't really know who you were
or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when I found out from Matt later
on, like where you're actually coming
from.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, my God, this guy knows so
much stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I talked to Matt for like six months
before I like dropped that I actually had
[SPEAKER_00]: like any experience in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like some of those early replies,
I've scrolled back and just like you talk
[SPEAKER_00]: to me like I'm just such a fucking idiot
on the server.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like last year, this is how I got the
name Farmer Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working on this vegetable farm out
in the Napa Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to fucking Long Meadow Ranch and
the farmstead crew out there and Jess
[SPEAKER_00]: Arness, who runs that place, runs the
farming operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking great company, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the few jobs I've ever had
that I was like truly sad to fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I just didn't make enough money to
live in Napa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was making like twenty five
bucks an hour with a fucking son and like
[SPEAKER_00]: living at my grandpa's house because like
we were couch surfing when we came back to
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I couldn't get a fucking job
because I've been like a weed bro for so
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just happened to find this organic
vegetable farmer attached to a restaurant
[SPEAKER_00]: in like wine, like, you know, Vineyard and
Wine Company in Napa, who was just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: You seem like you know your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I do like I know a lot about like
growing vegetables because like I've
[SPEAKER_00]: always had a vegetable garden and like,
you know, like that skill kind of just
[SPEAKER_00]: like accumulated with the rest of my
growing experience slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But dude, fucking epic summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got like two gallons and bags worth
of fucking vegetable seeds from like
[SPEAKER_00]: twenty five different peppers and a dozen
different types of tomatoes and like
[SPEAKER_00]: different herbs and all kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we met.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of like our first like like
real exchange was I was just like like you
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing your health kick and you
started losing weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, oh, I'll hook you up
with a bunch of vegetable seeds if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just sent you a care package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wow, he's an actual
farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, actually like a grower grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when I that's all I thought at the
time, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he grows he grows vegetables,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've always been a seed guy of all
kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I love seeds of flowers, vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have a massive collection in my
refrigerator that I'm like constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to read up on.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's super cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I just wonder, right, like
especially after you've been telling the
[SPEAKER_03]: story of like some of your major
realizations as you got older and
[SPEAKER_03]: especially encountering some of these like
big failures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I wonder if that impacted the way you
presented yourself to us on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was definitely did not come in here like
big dick swinging at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm a fucking failure because
I was in like I was like fucking depressed
[SPEAKER_00]: as shit when I first got on the server
because I listened for probably the first
[SPEAKER_00]: year or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is this going now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like three years now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, for the actual show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think two or three years, two and a half
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two and a half, three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I listened for the first year and a
half or two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like I got on the server and like
probably only like October of last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some, somewhere around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it was like right before I like took
this job and like moved to like work for
[SPEAKER_00]: this MSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but anyway, I go, I'm working at
this vegetable farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, they have these like private dinners
and stuff that you pay like $200 a plate
[SPEAKER_00]: to sit at and like, yeah, hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking worth it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go back when I got the,
it sounds like it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like the whole experience is so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like you go out and there's like a
meet and greet and they've got like
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking hemmony barico that they've like
aged on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've got like all this local
fucking honey and cheese and shit that
[SPEAKER_00]: came off of our properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you drink wine with the locals and
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you sit down and you have like a
three to five course fucking meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like most of it's come from like
our, our, their fucking a cattle ranch
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have on the coast and all the
vegetables that we grew down in the valley
[SPEAKER_00]: in Napa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was so fucking cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I wish I had the money to do that
regularly because like you meet all kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of cool people that are all obviously very
wealthy and successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you run in those circles,
but they loved, they loved just like
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like I'm a pretty like fucking clean
cut looking guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I was in weed, people are always
like surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, you're not what I expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm not covered in tattoos or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just look like a nice little white
boy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and so, um, they, yeah,
they ate that shit up when I was in Napa,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, you're a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a handsome young blonde kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they were fucking all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go out there to one of these dinners
and like, they want me to like sit and
[SPEAKER_00]: like talk about all the courses and like
what's provided by the farm on each,
[SPEAKER_00]: on each course and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the placard just says, meet farmer
Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like what the icon is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, that was the first time that
anyone called me that, that anybody like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just like snapped a photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have the, I have that exact frame
photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stole it from the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I'm taking this shit home
with me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that's how I became farmer Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I, I'd never had a good handle
before like on, on IG I'm like five three
[SPEAKER_00]: O underscore DC, like super anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like one photo of me on the,
in like, you know, six or seven years of
[SPEAKER_00]: being on IG, like, um, you know,
and that's just the, that's the little
[SPEAKER_00]: breadcrumb for people to like scroll
through and be like, who the fuck is this
[SPEAKER_00]: guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, Oh, I know that guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never, I've never, I don't think I
even know what you look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen that picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a scroll.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a fucking, I think I sent you a
photo when I was in like, um, when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: in, uh, in the surgery prep or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, I was DMing with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was just like, I had to chill at
the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like when you do a kidney donation,
normally the donor goes in first and they
[SPEAKER_00]: take it out and then they prep the other,
they're prepping the other guy and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they open them up and immediately put it
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my dad's health was like really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had had to have like a double bypass
for his heart, um, in the December before
[SPEAKER_00]: the surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like six or seven months before,
and just like really poor general health,
[SPEAKER_00]: just from being in kidney failure,
you know, and so they actually had to open
[SPEAKER_00]: him up first to even make sure that they
could actually do the surgery,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because they have to basically
like find a vasculature and like find
[SPEAKER_00]: veins and arteries to match up to that'll
actually supply adequate blood flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were really worried that they
wouldn't have that, that it all be like
[SPEAKER_00]: right after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just worried to be like really
atrophied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, I had to like sit there and
wait, not knowing if I was having surgery
[SPEAKER_00]: or not five to like 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was just like scrolling through
the fucking, uh, um, the server and shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bullshitting on general chat and like
fucking trying to keep my mind off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, started doing like a little bit
of writing that I've like continued doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, because that's like, I have a lot to
say, obviously, you know, like I have the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking gift of the gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can talk for fucking ever, especially
about weed, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, oh, if you're so
fucking opinionated and nobody wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: like listen to you say it in person,
like that's kind of like priming material
[SPEAKER_00]: for being a writer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can encourage that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to hear my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so and that's like what I thought,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I started talking to normal
people, like, like talking to nurses and
[SPEAKER_00]: like fucking nurse practitioners when like
I was doing all this and they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just fucking roll my eyes and I'm
just like, I'm a weed guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know, it's going to spark like
fucking hundred run on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just because they have no fucking
clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, then you have to like try and
summarize your entire experience in the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed industry and what it's like,
and like a few sentences in a casual
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation, like it just doesn't fucking
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like, I don't think that I had
any like unique or like amazing or like
[SPEAKER_00]: scaled once in a lifetime experience,
like in the, in this industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like it was definitely just like an
uncommon experience for normal people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I have no skill in writing,
you know, like I can write decently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to college, like, but I'm much more
on like the scientific side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we can talk writing another time,
I reckon, because that I'm also sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_03]: At this stage, I think we did want to ask
you about some of the tech that you got to
[SPEAKER_03]: play with and some of the projects that
you got to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt mentioned something about you scoping
pollen grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been a big thing with like the
reversal research is just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: why are, why are, why are certain times
it's a failure, even though you have like
[SPEAKER_00]: a good pollen drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started just like doing the base
science behind pollen, seeing what other
[SPEAKER_00]: people do for like pollen viability and
like number one, you just scope it,
[SPEAKER_00]: see if it looks normal or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can start doing things like
starch staining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like you just put iodine on it
because like a live pollen, it's basically
[SPEAKER_00]: a miniature plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people have this misconception.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pollen is sperm cells from a plant
and it's not, it's like a little
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this thing they call the alteration of
generations and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I definitely did not know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like pollen is not a sperm cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a miniature plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a small clump of cells,
like maybe 15 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has the ability that once it
germinates, it creates sperm cells in a
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen tube, but then fertilize the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ovule itself is actually a separate
plant and type of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the gamete.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gametophyte is what they call it in
botany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the plant you see and that you're
growing is the sporophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically supposed to multiply
itself, but the gametophyte, which is like
[SPEAKER_00]: the big thing in flowering plants that
like make flowering plants, what they are
[SPEAKER_00]: in like a separate lineage is the
retention of that ovule onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: sporophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in primitive plants that used to
drop the ovule, like in seaweed,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, it drops the ovule into the
water current and the other sporophyte
[SPEAKER_00]: that's or the other gametophyte that's the
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drops the sperm into the water current and
they all just meet somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So pollen's not sperm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to bust anyone's fucking bubble.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's funny because we use that,
that like illusion for people who don't
[SPEAKER_04]: understand like how males and females
reproduce, but you're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's not the same method of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, I guess I never mentioned at all
that like when I was at Humboldt's or I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess I did say I was studying botany,
but like I studied a lot of like seaweed
[SPEAKER_00]: and phycology too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that's where you really get into
the nitty gritty of like how plants
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved because it all happened in the
water to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all modern plants come from like,
you know, in the, in water first,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they come to land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you get into like
mycorrhizae and their coevolution with
[SPEAKER_00]: plants because plants didn't have roots as
we know them when they first evolved and
[SPEAKER_00]: made it on the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they actually needed that relationship
to absorb nutrients and minerals and other
[SPEAKER_00]: things they need from the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why we have that like
symbiosis, you know, it's not just like
[SPEAKER_00]: mycos powder that we figured out works
with weed plants, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there was like a time that I didn't
know that all this shit was applicable
[SPEAKER_00]: either that it's like for all plants,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Oh, mycorrhizae, that's just like
something we have from like forestry and
[SPEAKER_00]: like knowledge of trees and mycology that
like we've applied to agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that we like discovered it in
agriculture first, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, you can get this like closed
view that it's like, Oh, this is just a
[SPEAKER_00]: weed thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, no, man, it's just a thing
for plants, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get really deep in your Canon
knowledge, you'd be surprised how much of
[SPEAKER_00]: it like crosses over, you know,
as just general knowledge about plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also think that it's a bit narrow minded
for people who grow these plants to just
[SPEAKER_03]: look at resources about growing these
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like even doing the research for some of
the breeding episodes that we did,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was so cool to go and look at like
apple trees or like citrus, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and look at what they had done and like
the history of the breeding development
[SPEAKER_03]: for those kinds of crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much out there that like,
yeah, you know, people shouldn't be scared
[SPEAKER_03]: to go and dig through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and one thing I've noticed too,
is that like getting an education in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, it's not really going to help
you in cannabis because all the tools you
[SPEAKER_00]: get used to using, they just don't fucking
exist yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there are for private industries
with shit like chimeras doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But like beyond that, man, like fucking
nobody has this shit as like public
[SPEAKER_00]: information to learn from and do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like a lot of, a lot of advanced
genomics are predicated on like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, well, I know every fricking allele of
every gene in this entire genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, we don't even have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we had to try and like drive
home when we were doing our seed making
[SPEAKER_03]: and breeding episodes to kind of like draw
the line between where the science can
[SPEAKER_03]: really apply for people at home or like,
you know, smaller scales and being like,
[SPEAKER_03]: look, there's a lot of this that's
idealized that just doesn't work for us.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, people get scared about like,
you know, CRISPR technology and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like, it's, it's just not quite
there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still going through the basics of
like really old school seventies and
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties tech of like making polyploids
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's still not a general consensus
of like, whether that's like even valuable
[SPEAKER_00]: to do or not, you know, like there isn't a
certain aspect of like, oh, a triploid
[SPEAKER_00]: plant can't be pollinated by like a
diploid or a tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, but it's, it's for like midsy field
grown weed that doesn't need to be perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who gives a shit if your field grown weed
has some fucking seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to blast it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, sit it in the dirt anyways while
you're waiting to stack it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw some weed that was like field grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just covered in clay and just like
disgusting, absolutely combine harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking horrific weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like they were packaging it for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was just like, you think you can
sell this as flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, we know we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they probably did, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they're probably doing too
well anymore though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's funny is the everyone talks shit on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's this midsy ass place for weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma has more fire weed on the shelf
than California does because of a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: small groups that operate with high
integrity and have been allowed to like
[SPEAKER_00]: carve out their local niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually support small local
companies out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like California says they are,
but the second they got the chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking go Dick ride some dude and get a
cookie hoodie, you know, they're lining up
[SPEAKER_00]: out the door, but you know, literally,
yeah, yeah, literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like it's the, I've seen things in
Oklahoma, like fucking small local boys
[SPEAKER_00]: who started off with nothing ascend to
like the top of the industry there to
[SPEAKER_00]: where like their shit sells out every time
they drop it, you know, like they're
[SPEAKER_00]: making good fucking money for themselves
and like surviving this whole fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom out of the industry because they
have a good solid business and a good
[SPEAKER_00]: solid base of customers that support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't really see that in
California unless it's a giant corporate
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I think just consistency
overall, you know, Oh, I go and I get
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking permanent marker from Doja.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, okay, I can respect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's how products should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be consistent, especially if
it's going to be labeled as medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at sun grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a vintage though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, this is the 2018 or the 2023
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have its own unique nuance
to it, even if it's the exact same seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: or cuts that I grew the year before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, I don't think that there's
like a lot of these large companies want
[SPEAKER_00]: to like extrapolate to the nationwide and
worldwide and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, dude, I don't think you
really can because even an indoor that set
[SPEAKER_00]: up the same in the same city, and you can
barely tell which fucking facility you're
[SPEAKER_00]: in because the rooms are so identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put out a different fucking product
than the one down the road a few miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's noticeably different in quality
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where like they can spot it and tell
you where it came from kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh, it did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of like what I see from this
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's like, okay,
and like consumers know to where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I'm looking for jars that say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I've heard that echoed even
on the first smoke of the day from seed
[SPEAKER_00]: junkie and those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, people know and the
consumers like start recognizing what
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities they want weed from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan, I wanted to bring it back to some of
the other products and projects that you
[SPEAKER_03]: may have done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know how much detail obviously
you can speak to these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know you mentioned like tissue,
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's interesting to me because
obviously most of the time when someone
[SPEAKER_03]: brings up tissue culture, I kind of roll
my eyes because yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like some kind of they got scammed
and they bought some stupid home kit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you are someone who's probably
actually seen on the ground, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in a commercial industrial
context, what it actually is where it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on it at the
moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is still so fledgling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think that the bros with a science
background like me have figured out a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe based on success rates,
I've seen that people are accurately doing
[SPEAKER_00]: Maristem cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't fucking believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you can do 12 perfectly executed
Maristem cultures, but only one comes up
[SPEAKER_00]: actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean and virus free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is a numbers game associated
with it's not the technique that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that I think that there's more
people kind of scamming other people by
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching them techniques that are
technically proper, but they don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the success rates that they claim they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: People make it out like that if I Maristem
something and then throw it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: thermocycler and like keep that heat amped
up that it'll like force the virus to
[SPEAKER_00]: express and like, oh, it's free and I
tested it and it's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like if that was the case,
then why is HLVD still such a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: industry's ruining crop for not just us,
but for hops too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's massive losses reported worldwide
over HLVD and hops has way much more,
[SPEAKER_00]: way more money and traditional ag behind
it than we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still haven't figured it out for
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have kind of like two different
questions because I know people are
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in tissue culture for a couple
of different reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is just the preservation, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's its key feature and then
that's its only feature and then the other
[SPEAKER_03]: one and then the other one being like
clean it up, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cleaning up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a third.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of the, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the third one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Third is actually commercial propagation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's unnecessary though.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like with that, like what they found
out was they cannot insert these,
[SPEAKER_04]: these tissue culture clones immediately
and then grow them because they had so
[SPEAKER_04]: many hormones that they were all just
firing off nuts and fucking balls
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not only that it's like,
there's a long turnaround time from
[SPEAKER_00]: turning a micro plant into like a full
sized team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that veg time is fucking consistently
or like, like genuinely a lot longer than
[SPEAKER_00]: if I just cut a clone and grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the main application that I see is
like tissue cultured and Maristem moms and
[SPEAKER_00]: those getting cycled out quarterly and
then just doing like standard cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: protocols because like then you're cutting
off of a clean mom that's routinely
[SPEAKER_00]: getting cycled through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting tested and verified quarterly
and like then you, you're, you're starting
[SPEAKER_00]: from a clean base, but you also have the
efficiency of doing traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no market except for maybe hemp,
but hemp can is all for extraction and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can just use seed, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like there, I just per like,
I don't, there's so many techniques like
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the fucking point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I've tried to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had it almost right, but it just like,
I knew another guy in LA that did it and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's like, well, I can cryo store it for
six months like this and it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: German.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, and I'm like, so like,
but we could just do that with a tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture sample, you know, and we could
just do that with a normal culture and
[SPEAKER_00]: small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember when that passion took
that to market?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I didn't try to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was in 2009.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I might be off by a few years,
but they actually tried to take it to
[SPEAKER_04]: market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they were finding was that it,
it was so hard for people that germinate a
[SPEAKER_04]: regular seed, you know, that there was no
way, no way it was ever going to last or
[SPEAKER_04]: be, be financially viable or firstly
viable because people can't even germinate
[SPEAKER_04]: a normal seed, let alone.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A micro plant lit in this encapsulated in
a gel of fucking hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good fucking luck with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it doesn't have, it doesn't have
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it ever like without a lab,
it's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of like the three kind of like
main outcomes that people are looking for,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we said preservation,
propagation, cleaning up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we saying that like out of all three,
like not in on, on any of those fronts has
[SPEAKER_03]: not gone that far or it's not far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preservation is kind of like the main
course, as far as I'm concerned,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the other things are kind of like,
yeah, it can work.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have shown that it does work in
certain circumstances and not in others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we'll get to a point where
with like the right antivirals and proper
[SPEAKER_00]: Maristem culturing and just proper
technical like overall of knowing that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, just because I did the process
doesn't mean it's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then like, we'll get to a point where we
can clean up plants to a certain degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe get them virus free because
like, I trust that certain people are
[SPEAKER_00]: smart enough to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're smarter than me for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think it's an impossibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that like the people
executing are just not our top tier
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if Chimera told me in some giant
Canadian MSO told me that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, no, we've nailed it and we invested a
few million in this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we made it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, we're not sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it, especially if they weren't
sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were making it public,
I'd be like, no fucking way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to share info.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think that's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever you can't patent something,
they're like fucking lip sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like, if we can't profit off
it, then we are not going to allow anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: else to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's just like another sign of
the breakdown of the culture going towards
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a corporate culture is that it's
just like, even if it's industry wide,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, needed for the community and the
industry to go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one company has it and no one else
does, they're not going to fucking share
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too much money on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, the people investing in these
companies are like billionaire hedge funds
[SPEAKER_00]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like fucking black rock owns weed
companies, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, um, the everything is,
is profit motivated obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like, um, it's like, I'd like to make
a living doing this obviously too,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's just like at the cost of other
people in the community and not for the
[SPEAKER_00]: betterment of it, but actually to like
detract from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it seems it's, it's fucked in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I, I kind of do want to ask you
about like what you see in the future for
[SPEAKER_03]: the industry, but before we get to that,
I'm just noting we have about 20,
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 minutes probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I'm not being too greedy here,
but like, in terms of like your experience
[SPEAKER_03]: outside of like, say like the tissue
culture stuff and like the, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: reversal stuff that you've talked to us
about, are there any other kinds of
[SPEAKER_03]: projects or tech that you wanted to
highlight or that you found interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: that you could touch on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean like a lot of the stuff's
pretty standard that I do honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just more like the rate that I do it
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like I make hybrids constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we have, like a fully fleshed out
scheduled breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like fucking to the date.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pollinations need to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cuts need to be taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: These need to go onto the next part of the
process, you know, but like most of it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the rate that we fucking do it
at and the structure beyond that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think is really cool that I hadn't
really experienced, you know, cause like
[SPEAKER_00]: whenever I did Fino hunts, it was like one
or two things at a time, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm constantly Fino hunting,
like, fucking 20 different things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, taking notes, fucking like
crossing them together, doing all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: shit, just seeing what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when we first met, you,
you seemed a little bit like, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: hesitant to tell me like where you work
for and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think like maybe, maybe because
people do judge immediately, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I was trying to hedge
against.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get to know me first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like realistically from my point of
view, like all I would think, all I was
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking was, wow, what an opportunity to
go through a whole bunch of like any
[SPEAKER_04]: lines, just like a great, totally
advantageous.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I would have taken that job even
with what I do for a living.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have taken that job because of
what you get to see the scale of what you
[SPEAKER_04]: get to see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much to learn for anyone,
anyone at any skill.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I applaud it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you took it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I have to remind myself of that pretty
constantly because there's parts of it
[SPEAKER_00]: that I don't like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I see plants that I think should go
forward that get smashed and tossed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: side and thrown away because they're not a
perfect commercial offering on the first
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid, you know, but I'm like,
Oh, but that would be such a cool parental
[SPEAKER_00]: for this reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like this would be like, you know what
I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, that's the part that I'm
still like pushing for a lot is just like
[SPEAKER_00]: not more control, but just like more
variety of like the things that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, because a lot of people,
including our competitors and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: they want like quick mash ups to like be
able to market, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the market demands it constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's like, you got to have new shit at
least twice a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have two releases a year,
like your old news, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like realistically, like quarterly,
you better have one for every brand that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have like new cuts coming down the
pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't think people understand
that like nowadays it's not so much of
[SPEAKER_00]: like, what cuts do I have access to?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, what hasn't been done before?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's actually new and exciting?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like genuinely fucking hard to
place your thumb on because it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can cross OGs and Skittles and fucking
Sherb and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: A ton of other people already have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already been released.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cycled through the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, like where to go next is
honestly, I think the big question for
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone, like we're still riding cookies
hype to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have changed its name slightly to
see junkie or to fucking Doja or whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tony Mendo and all those dudes and
their Skittles run.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, it's really, even all of that is
still predicated on cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all predicated on cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the perfect moment for me to ask you
then, like what has been historically some
[SPEAKER_03]: of your favorite stuff to grow and smoke,
grow and consume, but also like what areas
[SPEAKER_03]: of the gene pool do you think still hold
potential for the future?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess one part is like the past
and one part is the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always gravitated towards like blue
dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously I love when we do hybrids of
that, but it's predictable, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know exactly what it's going to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to smell like blue dream sorta.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have a big chunky structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I can tell when stuff's
like 50% blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like pretty fucking obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's what was so cool about pack is
that he took both the bullies,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Train wreck and blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both bullies in the breeding room
and you got to see who who's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking overcome the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like really great that like,
they actually kind of met in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was like together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was a little more dominant with
that turpinoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that lined up with like that super
silver haze background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but like there's still noticeable blue
dream traits in there that, that mellow
[SPEAKER_00]: out that, that the harshness of the T-dub.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I'm sure someone else has already
said all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to local talk about these all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he's in love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I like, what did he pop like a
pack of 10?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, I got seven keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an exaggeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like our young bachelor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, he's not a bachelor.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's married.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he?
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys to the plant guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say what's his name,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what do I like about the past?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, where's the future going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, I always lean towards like,
OG and chem hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like where I want to smoke at
the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not much of a daytime smoker
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I have like a quote unquote big
boy job and I have like responsibilities
[SPEAKER_00]: and like, when I come home, I'm a dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to do shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to do chores.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to like help make dinner and do all
the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, I have some like dad weed is
what I call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or like, I like smoking higher right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 18 and a half percent THC,
but it's fucking tasty as all get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that sour mango candy type thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that flavor with some cheese
behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it's fucking great for daytime
smoke, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do my job all day on that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, even though most days I choose not to,
but it's, it's good for me when I like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I got to go take my kid to the park
and be the responsible one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's like, uh, papaya.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, papaya.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's some sort of a green crack or a
Betsy hybrid is guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has probably probably green crack
because Betsy probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she's got some qualities of Betsy that
I think like line up pretty decently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but like it could go either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the stuff in Betsy, I think it's
skunk one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like literally just like,
Oh, well, there are two things from the
[SPEAKER_00]: same place anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, I need dad weed nowadays,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I'm going to the park and I'm
walking with my two year old trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure he doesn't run into the street
and die, like I don't want to be zonked
[SPEAKER_00]: out on some fucking like ghost OG or some
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking high off my ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, like dad, dad weed has been
fucking key to my life being like
[SPEAKER_00]: productive lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then like, once the kid goes to bed,
man, like I'm fucking racking bong loads
[SPEAKER_00]: of the fucking OG and chem every night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and of course that permanent markers
permanent marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best weed that's ever existed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is pretty much the best weed that's
ever existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only second to zonk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soap though, obviously for the listeners
out there, it's going to be replacing blue
[SPEAKER_00]: bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best there's ever been people can hate
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I went through a jar of it and it's
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't hold the high through
long-term smoking, you know, like when you
[SPEAKER_00]: first rip a couple bowls of it for a day
or two, you are getting lit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the first cookies that like actually
had a decent high like for me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a minute, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, and it's a great Shurb
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he says it's like a biscotti BX
Shurb or some shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I believe that because
biscotti is very particular in how it
[SPEAKER_00]: breeds and like how it like profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few bags of you to do,
um, reviews with like, I got some lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry and some biscotti and, um,
I'm trying to get that soap for you and so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can try the real deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not bad, but it's that idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just like not like, the perfumey
stuff has never been like my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my forte either, but it is
interesting because you don't see it as
[SPEAKER_00]: often.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for sure coming out of that Bubba.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would assume like something called Zope
would smell soapy and it does to a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a perfumey soap that like that,
like what Bubba does, cause that's what it
[SPEAKER_00]: is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's soap, which is like Bubba kush
kushments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think cross to Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's like the actual
lineage or not, but it's what I would
[SPEAKER_00]: assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it smells kind of like Skittle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like Sherb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like Skittles and some perfume
notes behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, so it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was enjoyable, but it's just
not something that I would like gravitate
[SPEAKER_00]: towards like every day, you know,
like I like Sherb, but it's just not a
[SPEAKER_00]: daily driver for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the future fuck if I know what's
coming up, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everyone's just trying to see come
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want to see or what,
what interests you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and that's like the thing life,
like why I've kind of just like stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: doing personal breeding at all is like,
I'm in like an exploration phase right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, I've got some of these
testers from pack that I'm really excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got those, um, blue bonnet F twos
that you just sent me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are definitely high up on the list
to get pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what else?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've got some punchy punchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Punchy is going in, but that might be a
commercial run.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm stoked to see that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to, I'll get that one worked in
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to, I know who to leverage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, um, it's honestly like a really
big, huge question in the industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: like, well, what's next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everything has just been a
continuation of those original cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts and like nothing has been very
original.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was trying to explain it to,
and it's just like, well, if I take
[SPEAKER_00]: gelato, which is just supposedly girl
scout and sherbet, which is really just
[SPEAKER_00]: like cherry pie and OG and F1 derb and
Urkel all fucked together in one big pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like what are you really ever
going to find by taking something out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the later generations and doubling it back
to Urkel, doubling it back to OG,
[SPEAKER_00]: doubling it back to even F1 derb or
whatever, if that's really in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't really know what you're
going to find besides a slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: reinvigorated version of the same exact
thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I view those as just like dead
ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's really much that's
like currently available.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to make any waves anytime
soon beyond like, what we already see with
[SPEAKER_00]: permanent marker and soap and gassy candy
type strains, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you're talking about something
earlier, the big rush for OG now,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a lot of us, dude, everyone's
searching again right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've done a bunch of work,
like making in-crosses and like crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: different OGs together, which was its own
whole fun adventure and reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like, it's not the hardest reversal
out there, but it's not, it's not easy
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I got them to fucking,
dump bro after on the third attempt,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like we were working together just
like slowly honing in the recipe of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: all right, well here's a normal STS
recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's too strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's dilute that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's play with some additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so like most of the additives I'm
playing with are like, um, different
[SPEAKER_00]: metals because, um, silver is a plus two
ion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you go down that line on the
periodic table, there's a few others too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's cobalt, I think zinc is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a bunch of these heavier
metals that all kind of fit and replace
[SPEAKER_00]: that same, um, effect, not quite as well
as silver, but that's why I'm using them
[SPEAKER_00]: as like a low dose additive is like,
well, do they push certain things over the
[SPEAKER_00]: edge?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like with OGs, like the, the STS with
cobalt seemed to fucking do the trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was, uh, I'll keep my dilutions
to myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can fuck around and find out if
you want to do it too, but it took me some
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking work to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that's the reverse
triangle too.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I remember correctly, that's the one
that kind of puts it over the cobalt STS.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like we both know what type of fucking
cobalt that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I don't even understand how it's
possible that it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, like most people's recipes
are really just a fat dose of silver
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, you know, and then like,
yo, you throw some fucking South
[SPEAKER_00]: thiosulfate in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works for most things, but there's
definitely a lot of genetics that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Z Z does not like that normal ass
fucking recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I've actually had some better
success with it using colloidal recently,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I know is like a joke and reversal
tech, but like, um, with our buddies,
[SPEAKER_00]: stupid overpriced mix with a routine spray
of colloidal seem to do the trick for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Z family.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever seen a one and done spray?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it works for a lot of shit,
but it's just like, is it one and done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Debatable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, because every 14 days,
the sex tries to push back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I've noticed with,
with these one and done's what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed is that the top 30% of the plant
always goes back to female before it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually drops pollen or it drops it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all those stigma just like absorb
all that pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before it can like, you can collect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, I don't like the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: People seem to think that there's this
like one and done spray that works on all
[SPEAKER_00]: plants magically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I've just haven't seen it work
out that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't make sense to me sexually
because if they start reversing in two
[SPEAKER_04]: weeks, at least two sprays.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But two doses of a fucking gram of silver
nitrate per gallon will fucking fry your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what you see with those
sprays too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I was talking to, to one of
these guys that won't be named,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, about his reversal tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, he was basically telling me that
like, he thinks that the stress response
[SPEAKER_00]: from the spray itself is one of the number
one inhibiting factors and reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that actually makes a lot
of sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you spray silver nitrate and it
has the effect of blocking ethylene,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it also activates all of these stress
responses from, yeah, that that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck up what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we do find that plants at the
ultimate health are the best to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say what you will about that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was fucking pretty bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, um, that was one of the key
takeaways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we had like a two hour long
conversation about different reversal
[SPEAKER_00]: techs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you talked about injecting
gibberellic acids straight into the stem?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we didn't get that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, I, I got some, uh, I got some good
tips though that I actually am curious
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were the, the idea was
founded from like, you know, peer reviewed
[SPEAKER_00]: research where I was like, that is really
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm actually going to pursue that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and see if like, you know,
this was all bullshit and just conceptual
[SPEAKER_00]: or not, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of it was that I got from that dude
that sounded really intelligent was
[SPEAKER_04]: conceptual bullshit, but that's cool,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: In application though was, was kind of
interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, one of the, one of the techniques was,
and it only worked a few times,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it did work was applying GA3 late to
stretch the anthers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like, um, like one other one was like,
um, ABA, abscisic acid is like way
[SPEAKER_00]: important in seed set and senescence in
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like a spray of that followed up by an
oxygen to negate the effects beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not senescing the plant,
but you're assisting seed set.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yeah, that's an interesting
concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm going to play with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because oxygen is an ethylene promoter in
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, it doesn't always make sense
why you would want to do that when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: combining it with an ethylene blocker,
you know, there, there is some,
[SPEAKER_04]: there is some action combining certain
like IBA, IAA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the oxygen source is the key
differentiator because they don't all have
[SPEAKER_00]: the same response, even though they're all
oxens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like the avenues that I want to
look down are like two IP, benzo amino
[SPEAKER_00]: purine, you know, like there's a lot of
different oxens, um, to go and experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anyone really has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get like everything to reverse,
but there are certain plants that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm kind of thinking of it as like
groupings of families.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have my OG spray now and it works
really well for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how many times I need to spray it
and what rotation at what concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to work really well across
the board for OG types.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm slowly getting towards my Z recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to like verify that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have kind of like one-off anecdotal
evidence, but it fucking dumped twice as
[SPEAKER_00]: much pollen as it normally does.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a plus dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, CSI still fighting with it and
like, and instead go trying to go to S
[SPEAKER_04]: ones to reverse those to try to get,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've thought about that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I have a handful that I'm working
with right now that are much easier to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with than Skittles itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not dead ringers as far as the
nose department.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never quite are, you know,
that that Skittles nose is a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: one-off man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran through a lot of S ones and we
didn't find a dead ringer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to just tease that.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll keep that as a teaser.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we may be doing a Z sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keyline pie episode, uh, with local maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, me and him have been having excellent
private conversations about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to, I'm going to do my best to
also either bring CSI in on that or get
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys to write me down a bunch of
questions and things you want me to,
[SPEAKER_04]: or things you want his opinion on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll get that into the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost want like opinions of my findings
too, whether he like thinks that that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes sense based on what he's seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I didn't run his S ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Skittles is pretty identifiable once
you know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got it from the same source.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like a constructive side to this
too, for me, which is I think local is
[SPEAKER_03]: actually interested in like a little
project himself to kind of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fix them out and see how to like,
you know, do what with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it could both be quite a cool,
like history slash like info slash
[SPEAKER_03]: speculation, but also maybe like a
hypothetical breeding project kind of,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, episode as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will say this, um, in meeting Dan and
over time becoming like knowing who he is
[SPEAKER_04]: and in cannabis and stuff, and even though
he worked for, that was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when we really, really, really
connected, just when I realized that
[SPEAKER_04]: there's not a lot of people besides me and
CSI and maybe the other person we were
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's done a lot of research into
reversals, but when I realized he had done
[SPEAKER_04]: more, he'd taken the research further than
I'd taken it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when I got interested in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really did put me back in the moats for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just kind of done with my spray as
far as, okay, it's there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I finished it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does what I needed to do for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's kind of inspired me to get back
into it a little bit and get back into the
[SPEAKER_04]: science and the.
[SPEAKER_04]: The R and D and get back into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, thanks for that inspiration too,
because like, it felt very dead for a long
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's, it's just colloidal silver as
they always say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my spray is just colloidal anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, every time we bring it up in the
fucking on the, like when we're doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube live and shit, there's always some
asshole that says colloidal colloidal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every fucking time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I see it and I think of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like, I know he saw that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that fucking douchebag.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just fringed in his heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just say that I am selfishly stoked
because like now that we have access to
[SPEAKER_03]: Pharma Den, like we're just gonna,
oh man, we're gonna milk it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, I've got a lot of things to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may get redundant at a certain point,
but it's just like, I never have answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just have data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I've seen a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a lot of breeding and like,
I don't ever claim to have the answers for
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, but I can tell you what I've
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we always talk about, and like the
whole Skittles thing, it's just like
[SPEAKER_00]: whether key lime pie and green sherb are
the same cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not convinced, but certain people are,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's a problem is we've never had all
of them together sourced from the key lime
[SPEAKER_04]: pie source and green sherb in the room at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we can't source it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supposedly burning Bush nurseries down in
SF is still up and running and still sells
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, for real?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still get, order it off his
fucking website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never tried it because I was just
like, Oh, what are the chances?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: By clone, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was apparently one of the closer
original sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been able to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, um, that whole mystery is
still just like unfolding for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like I keep growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it never answers it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll find that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll find the picture of the key lime pie
S ones that I have.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it could be that too, like
realistically, like, so when I grew green,
[SPEAKER_04]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I grew green sherb as well,
it was when I was working in LA,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we did one run of it alongside the
sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we got it at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very different than what I
remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: From key lime pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was much more gelato structured.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not like key lime to me reeks like
key lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it is that exact profile,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've done a lot of breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still have a lime right now that I
have seeds of in the fridge that when I
[SPEAKER_00]: pop it, people tell me they're like,
yeah, it's fucking limey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, dude, it was fucking
lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, when people tell me other
things about key lime, like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of just like this candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe melon and mango or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of like the one that I got,
you know, also, um, another little point,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like, um, fucking Norcal IC
mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time I deep dive his Instagram because
I was just like, Oh, I know you fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: worked green sherb for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I scrolled all the way down to
like fucking like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2013 or some shit and to the first picture
and mention of green sherb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had seeded itself in that run of
his.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, it obviously had the
potential to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't look amazing, but it had the
potential to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never had any sexual instability with
key lime pie, like whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See mine wasn't gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just straight lime.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to save this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go deeper on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got so much point.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the cliffhanger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the producer of the show right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been really awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I'm pretty sure we only like had
a fraction of what Dan had to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, man, I can fucking talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just ask my wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like she thinks I'm so fucking annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll definitely have you back on dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like the crew is getting much
bigger each time for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're finding some amazing people.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are really good communicators,
like a little hill, new boots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's people that are showing up
that like people really enjoy hearing from
[SPEAKER_04]: and, uh, that I personally enjoy talking
to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a big part of this podcast,
like, and in thousands learn this with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's someone I really don't like
jive with per se, like maybe we're good
[SPEAKER_04]: friends, but like I communicating and
sometimes it just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I really enjoyed this
conversation, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I've really enjoyed getting in with
the community more, especially like,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, um, Kush of the giants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I haven't talked with him much,
but like we've been on voice chat a few
[SPEAKER_00]: times together and like here in the
fucking episode with him and seeing his
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of his fucking outdoor,
I was just, yeah, I was floored by some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff in the resin content on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am such a shitty outdoor grower compared
to this guy, a shitty grower in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, he's, he's so humble too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he's only a few hours north of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to link up with him sometime.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a great dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, all the same interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking love weed guns, hunting,
fishing, all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the good stuff from America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything you want to plug?
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out any of that stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give a couple of the homie shout
outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my lifelong best friend Lucas stood by
me through everything and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was there for fucking all it and,
uh, still a fucking standup dude still in
[SPEAKER_00]: my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just went fishing with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking what was that last weekend?
[SPEAKER_00]: So fucking Lucas, you're my boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jake out in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're having some hard fucking
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking keep it up, bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit's going to turn around and fucking
drew and pager out there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are fucking rock stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, all my boys on the syndicate,
you know, we're, I'm in the youths,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with the younger cats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like Loke fucking earns thousand
in me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids table.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is not the kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is not the kids table.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a kids table.
[SPEAKER_04]: That ain't it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally call us the youths because we
got so many fucking old timers and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love, I love the fact that like,
I can, I can genuinely feel good that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: not just a bunch of us from a certain
generation trying the hardest to reach out
[SPEAKER_04]: to the next generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have people younger than us,
smarter than us, better looking than us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like shout out to all the homies that
have been sending me seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, you know, making me feel
welcome and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I got a nice little care package from
high and lonesome and from pack and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you guys are fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad that I get to hang out with y'all and
fucking, you know, ask the million fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: questions I always do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always hit people up in the EMS and I'm
like, there's no niceties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, Hey, what do you think
about this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's how we all are.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so acceptable.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also fucking on the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking love papaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like green crack to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me what you think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to be talking about our
lives?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell no.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My life's a life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine's a long, sad story until more
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like make my own family and like
started getting some like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: homies with more like interests and just
good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've met a lot of good people on
the server.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, and what I hope to be lifelong
homies, if I don't fuck it all up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so no, I'm not a hustler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so sad that I tried to be for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just didn't work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't force what's not meant to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I mean, a lot of us did like his
kids and with other things and other
[SPEAKER_04]: substances, you know, like it happens and
you learn our way bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we found our way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what I'd do without weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't know where I'd be.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, no, this server has been great
for just like my overall mental health and
[SPEAKER_00]: just like the sense of community and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like, you know, I found my spot
in this industry as far as just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never met weed bros that I liked that
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, there's not that many nice
people in this industry and have found
[SPEAKER_00]: that like fucking 1% that's all us fucking
nerds all in one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's fucking epic, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's why it's first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, no, like I'm going to be
like the best version of myself possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I want to keep this going,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can be around people that inspire
you to be a better version of yourself,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is what you guys do for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it does make you feel more whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you guys inspire me that it's
just like, well, I may have seen a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's plenty more that I didn't see
it cause I'm too young.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's so great to have that access
to just like reference stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just like, I wasn't there
for the, for most of the fucking nineties
[SPEAKER_00]: and two thousands in the weed industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like getting that reference point
is fucking huge for what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if like, we don't know where we've
been, then like, how do we move forward
[SPEAKER_00]: and make something new?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well with that thousand, do you have
anything you want to plug?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just want to thank Dan again for his
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's been a pleasure getting to
know you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that, what do we have?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have our Patreon.

into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, oh bro, this is so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like go read the fucking 40,000 messages
on that fucking channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's insane, bro.
