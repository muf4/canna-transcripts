[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_00]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-so-Dot, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully more people show up so we can
actually give a nice treatise on the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: present,
[SPEAKER_00]: future, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we can talk about the
future of Clone Wars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clone trading, clone collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about it a little bit recently
about a little bit of where people are
[SPEAKER_00]: that have a lot of these strains archived
that are rare and old and special.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think I've really given a full
long tale of how it kind of how it
[SPEAKER_00]: developed over time, how it was when we
were breaking into the scene, like how one
[SPEAKER_00]: would even go about collecting clones in
the first place because obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a lot of it's trading and not
everybody has something to trade at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about clone circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I gotta give myself the own crowd
cheer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until we start that, anybody have any
questions yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you want me to touch on so I
don't forget?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Clown hoarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can talk about clown hoarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of clowns hoarding in the
seed industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, did I?
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, clown hoarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clown hoarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bastards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clowns are always hoarding around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clone people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is about clone people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really, it's but going to the
theory of it should... Ben Sherman fool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how I roll clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's all the same theory,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can take a theory and apply it to
fools.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you guys can use some
critical thinking and apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have to go and go and go over
every single dipshit that's pretending to
[SPEAKER_00]: be in circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a lot easier just to
explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you know what it is or on a revege.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm not doing cloning tips and tricks,
but I mean, just for that quick one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's better to take it on a
revege.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's better to take it
beforehand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes things root easier after a
revege.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is George.
[SPEAKER_00]: George from Walmart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at 80 we can be close enough to
start this bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in the day, clones weren't really
a big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people were using seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say back in the day, I'm talking,
you know, 70s, 60s on through the 80s up
[SPEAKER_00]: until the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones weren't the primary source for
people to be passing genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of it was done in seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how a lot of this started.
[SPEAKER_00]: On in through when you get up into maybe
like the Northern Lights area would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: good example of how people started getting
in these circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That had certain genetics and we're
keeping them very tight and only passing
[SPEAKER_00]: it to people in their circles and trusted
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that all kind of started because,
you know, there were different people in
[SPEAKER_00]: each market and giving someone a special
clone that was considered elite at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the definition of elite back then is a
lot different than now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is definitely morph.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you didn't want to give someone in the
same area as you the same exact clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was super special because they'd be
knocking into your market and in your and
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys had ended up competing with each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you basically set yourself up to be
competed against.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times when clones were shared,
they were they were shared in different
[SPEAKER_00]: markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were also clone crews that were
pushing out tons of weight and all pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: each other to brand a particular line,
kind of like the Northern Lights stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you got into online when Overgrow was
popping up and all that, you had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that had amassed these small little
collections of clones during that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some bigger than others, but a lot of them
would amass these small clone collections
[SPEAKER_00]: and provenance wasn't as much as a serious
thing back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you saying clone hoarding over and
over and that's I'll get to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get to it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see these people amass these small
collections and as they would speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would learn to trust who was going to
keep their word on not passing said clones
[SPEAKER_00]: and making it back into their market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people would just take the clones
and run and do their own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rename it, pretend like it's a new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we get to today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I entered, I wasn't I didn't have
special stuff, but I was in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, there were a few
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best one I found was PNC was a
dude named Ape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say at least 80 percent plus
of his of his things were legit sourced.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a strain nerd like a lot of us are
still today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did some pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good sourcing of a lot of OG cuts,
pure cushions, purples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then, he did a really good job
sourcing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just fortunate to be in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also had a clone crew that we were a
part of with the hot spread crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that circle, people were allowed to
have the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't allowed to compete.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't allowed to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was that was super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't allowed to share it with people
outside the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you ended up with people
like, you know, the P-91 crew,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hogs breath crew, the bull rider crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had ended up with all these different
crews with their one specific cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of before the OG Kush
craze when all that was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once OG Kush hit, it was it was a lot of
fronting, a lot of pretending,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of fake sourcing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the online market, the online
forums kind of blew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started to get more and more permeated
and a lot harder to verify sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, most of the people that take this
seriously take provenance seriously in the
[SPEAKER_00]: first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say provenance, I don't mean
anything more than like like the term
[SPEAKER_00]: applies to art.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you if you have a painting that you
have and it's signed by someone,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can't prove where you got it from
back to the artist, you've lost the
[SPEAKER_00]: provenance and therefore it loses value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with clones, it's very much the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could say, I got this clone from XYZ,
but nobody knows how XYZ got that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, it's broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people who are super serious about it
don't really want to trade with you and
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't want to get in on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we go to today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trust in the market is is all but
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: People today tend to have popped up in the
last few years that are big in the clones
[SPEAKER_00]: trading scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I'm noticing that keep having the
same mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because they're trading with
people that are new to the scene,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, but have them convinced that they are
legit and connected to this guy or this
[SPEAKER_00]: guy or this guy or this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to me and my friends,
we all know who we've given clones to and
[SPEAKER_00]: who those people have given clones to.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, there's always going to
be exceptions to the rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, we know who has
what clone of old shit who has given it,
[SPEAKER_00]: who had permission to get it, who didn't
all of the above.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is still a fraud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people around selling clones online
aren't a part of those circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of those people selling clones online
like that with their big ass list like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, I got all these fucking clones,
fucking source from the breeder cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are not people that would ever
be trusted with clones in the first place
[SPEAKER_00]: from any of our circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not my circle, not the other circles that
are old that I'm not even a part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's going to trust these dudes with
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I'm seeing a lot of the
problems arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out your OnlyFans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radaridge does have a great OnlyFans.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got this great picture of his
testicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know any verified cuts that look
distinctly different than in his pictures?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get to the next topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Verifying cuts through pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a million reasons why this can't
and shouldn't be done and why you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: see guys like me and Inspecta and everyone
trying to verify clones through pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expressions and micro like in micro
climates and expressions things can look
[SPEAKER_00]: totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally fucking different.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are a few cuts that have
certain traits that we know always occur
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what the what the what the
Expression is there are certain traits
[SPEAKER_00]: that always pop out of certain clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point being you guys the best advice I
could ever give anyone is if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy spend money on a clone from someone
chase that shit all the way back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they can't do that, then there's an
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just take their word for it because
I've seen people saying some wild fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: shit that they're getting past Chem 91
directly from a certain source that didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: happen couldn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's sometimes it's hard to get
those answers, but if you can't get the
[SPEAKER_00]: answer then it's not worth getting because
every time I'm seeing people get screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go buy clones from these doofuses
they get screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they cannot trace the provenance
back to the original breeder, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem and you probably I mean you can
always take the risk and try but here's
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing if you're taking a risk and
trying but you've never had the original
[SPEAKER_00]: clone how are you ever gonna fucking
verify it and and people with the Chem 91
[SPEAKER_00]: cut wouldn't be selling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, Archive Portland is a great place
to get clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Archive is as big a nerd as anyone when it
comes to provenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're getting stuff from Archive
Portland, that's a great source.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean most of these kids are
just trading clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trading with people who have no
access to anything and shouldn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to anything and then some of these
dudes are cool and like they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand this has gone on and they
repeat it and they repeat the story and
[SPEAKER_00]: now someone else has that story and they
say but this guy's trustworthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, who is the guy that you got it from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that dude trustworthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is that is the best advice I could
ever give you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chase that shit up the chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not see places like Harborside they
have people that they randomly get so back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the day at least I don't know I don't
want to speak to now but back in the day
[SPEAKER_00]: they would have random people bring in
clays or trays of clones or they'd have
[SPEAKER_00]: their in-house cloner but often they'd
have people bring in trays of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trusting some random ass that a
budtender trusted to bring in clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: vet them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you guys ever talked to budtenders?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know they know less than probably you
do even if you're a new person budtenders
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get into provenance sourcing any of
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to source something do it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the time, meet people, be friendly,
be trustworthy, don't be a snake and you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: be surprised how quickly things open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've told that to people from day one and
everybody wants to work it around the
[SPEAKER_00]: around the back end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't comment on finest because I don't
I I don't know who they source stuff from
[SPEAKER_00]: etc but they've they've been very nice and
they've done great tissue culture work but
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as like yeah I know yeah let's see
pre-19 pre-79 $500 a pop that bubba that
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-79 bubba but yeah I mean if you don't
care then you're adding to the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankly that's that's really what it what
it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't care and you're passing these
stories on without doing the work then
[SPEAKER_00]: you're adding to the problem and that
that's where I have a problem and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: why you see all this confusion in the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: People throwing up pictures of Chem 91
that don't look like Chem 91 you know
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it's just a really weird grow maybe
they over blew it but I see people
[SPEAKER_00]: commenting in these in these fucking
threads for example let me see if I can
[SPEAKER_00]: find it real quick let me see a good
example of someone oh you can't really see
[SPEAKER_00]: it commenting in a thread that has no
fucking clue what they're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: this two currents guy he's new he's
probably newer than most of you but he's
[SPEAKER_00]: telling acting like he has a way that he
can oh that might be a fucking hybrid I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know my motherfucker where did you
source your Chem 91 to be making these
[SPEAKER_00]: judges judgments and claims oh oh you
didn't oh you didn't oh did you say you
[SPEAKER_00]: sourced it from one of my best friends
you're lying so it's how it goes it how it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes you know but then other people don't
know they see this dude speaking in there
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't know that he's a noob they
don't know any of that shit and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like oh well if he says it might be real
then it might that's how it goes this is
[SPEAKER_00]: how the shit just spins on and on and on
and on how people set them up up self
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves up to be a verifier of cuts
when they have no place verifying anything
[SPEAKER_00]: and you like I said you'll be hard-pressed
to find someone that will verify or shoot
[SPEAKER_00]: something down I could give you actually
with with Chem 91 I could give you a few
[SPEAKER_00]: pointers and I know I've mentioned a few
before but a few pointers leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: cannibalization that's nutrient burn
that's not the leaves cannibalizing
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves the one trade it does seem to
have is the never-ending white pistols but
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks like someone just knew burn the
shit out of s1 or hybrid of Chem 91 but in
[SPEAKER_00]: certain micro climates maybe maybe it's
hard to say but I would feel much more
[SPEAKER_00]: confident not even commenting on this
thing because there's no way there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: way to know for sure unless it's got a lot
of the traits and it's missing one so what
[SPEAKER_00]: can you do anyway yeah I just wanted to
give a quick example you know someone was
[SPEAKER_00]: claiming to have a cut of archives moon
bow cancel I didn't want to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: someone's claiming to have a cut of
archives moon bow well archive called them
[SPEAKER_00]: out on it and then the guys like oh no no
no no no I know I mean I had the breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: cut of uh something else rainbow belts or
something so another one that archives not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to pass cuts out his breeder cuts
out of so be careful be careful who you
[SPEAKER_00]: trust run these fucks down see what they
know about about sourcing cuts see who
[SPEAKER_00]: they're dialed into circle wise ask them
then go ask some dudes in the circle
[SPEAKER_00]: likely people will be honest with you and
tell you if they're in their circle or not
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very easy to do very fucking easy to
do anyway that's that's about what I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to run down on that I think I think
that it used to be more common knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: how you did it you make friends you get
into circles you don't get shit
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately because everybody's been
ripped off to shit you know some people
[SPEAKER_00]: get mad that they can't just get that
clone immediately because clone hoarders
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not fair you know why it's not fair
it's because fucking scammers rip everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: off and it's been been that way since day
one been that way since day one so people
[SPEAKER_00]: people that do have cuts are not like
super open to just some random new guy who
[SPEAKER_00]: says hey I'm cool give it to me I promise
like that's been done for years and years
[SPEAKER_00]: and years and years and been heard for
years and years and years and it's a major
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger for a lot of people people in
these circles love to share their clones
[SPEAKER_00]: do I look way more serious people in those
in those circles love to share their
[SPEAKER_00]: clones because they love sharing dank with
people they don't necessarily like to
[SPEAKER_00]: openly share clones with random people to
bastardize the clone another good example
[SPEAKER_00]: of this have been when everyone was trying
to chase joint breath for cams you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: could I could go way further into that but
I'm not going to for the sake of my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: mad elite not gonna I'm not gonna talk
about old people blood but needless to say
[SPEAKER_00]: blind leading the blind in that situation
and people were still paying joint breath
[SPEAKER_00]: for clones because they've really had that
hope it's that fear of missing out logical
[SPEAKER_00]: fallacy and it's also the appeal to
authority logical fallacy both of those
[SPEAKER_00]: are there the authority being oh well this
guy's a breeder he says he's a breeder and
[SPEAKER_00]: and Pete bud says he's legit well that
must mean these are legit well how much do
[SPEAKER_00]: you know about how much experience people
I've had with the actual clones have you
[SPEAKER_00]: ever heard the story about him bringing
Kim for as Kim D to a cup and entering it
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly so yeah I shouldn't have probably
gotten that far in but there's a point to
[SPEAKER_00]: it you can't just trust everyone just
because someone's name is even linked with
[SPEAKER_00]: the clone it's not necessarily a good
reason to necessarily take their word on
[SPEAKER_00]: on clone provenance so yeah anybody got
any questions about that
[SPEAKER_00]: the dog bud male exactly and P bud put his
name behind a dog bud male does that make
[SPEAKER_00]: any sense fuck no and everybody else
around him was telling don't do that that
[SPEAKER_00]: dude's a liar that's gonna be a problem
and come back to haunt you but sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: money is just too much of a yank I mean I
really really like to be bud I did but I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean you know he was backing someone who
said they were gonna murder me and someone
[SPEAKER_00]: who would say the n-word over and over and
over you know I can't deal with that I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't handle that hopefully he's he's
figured life out a little better and who
[SPEAKER_00]: to run with and who not to run with why I
gotta go be going to church just cuz I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: wearing a long sleeve hmm
[SPEAKER_00]: sg said he got a male knows that and he's
also said he didn't so you know that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: back to it I have a question where is it
the start of the line to get my money back
[SPEAKER_00]: you know problem is many don't care about
history or the provenance that make Louie
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly and in a lot of people in here are
in here because they do care about that
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's a point we want to get
everybody educated on the same page that
[SPEAKER_00]: oh no this is a key lime LaCroix yeah
these are the bomb that's pretty much what
[SPEAKER_00]: I always drink I haven't tried a fire
sample of apple fritter yeah I'm not a
[SPEAKER_00]: apple fritter guy I've never really run
that stuff so I can't comment on apple
[SPEAKER_00]: fritter lumpy's given me some good cuts so
before and they were legit so there is
[SPEAKER_00]: that lumpy was a good source for the the
cookies and cherry pie early on I brought
[SPEAKER_00]: as usual I brought out another guitar by
the way to show you guys just cuz I can I
[SPEAKER_00]: brought out the black beauty today now
this is just an epiphone black beauty but
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it's still very beautiful all
gold hardware I'm actually gonna change
[SPEAKER_00]: out these these pickups I have some
toaster hand wound pickups that are going
[SPEAKER_00]: in it look a little more Gretchen sound a
little more Gretchen yeah this is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the babies though all bound it's the old
epiphone headstock which I wish it would
[SPEAKER_00]: have been one of the new ones that look
more Gibson II but it is so pretty isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: it just a beautiful I don't remember why I
got it if I was thinking I was gonna play
[SPEAKER_00]: some Mike Ness style stuff or what but
yeah I'm not usually I'm the less pickups
[SPEAKER_00]: are better but this case I went for all
three shit's pretty anyway yeah leave it
[SPEAKER_00]: up if you can this is gonna be posted on
patreon after this so if you guys run a
[SPEAKER_00]: rewatch run it through the patreon stuff
yeah this is in a Gibson case too I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember where I got the case set for that
one are you a neck or bridge pickup kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of guy neck mostly neck I like the next
sounds for punk rock and garage
[SPEAKER_00]: here's from now I bet you're glad the
headstock is og yeah probably huh I just
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's so much prettier the other
headstocks are so much prettier but yeah I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean I wanted a Gibson one but in the end
after owning a bunch of Gibsons and a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of Epiphone's I've determined I like
the next better on on Epiphone Les Paul's
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why like they have something
closer to a Gibson SG type neck from my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and I like that nice thin neck
because I've got little lady hands you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the the I'm not familiar with the the
what is the story around the two Tim
[SPEAKER_00]: there's way more way more way more cuts of
Kim D than just to going around yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: there's way more there's the sham D the
Kim D the dirty D the dead ringer the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bundy sis and some of these are the same
cuts just renamed a hundred times so yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean there's tons tons tons tons even
Bodhi said his Kim 3 wasn't real yeah it
[SPEAKER_00]: like that Kim 3 came from a person that we
know past fake cuts the incognito dude but
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I really tried with incognito he has
a good an amazing seed collection by the
[SPEAKER_00]: way like it's not just shitting on the
dude but he did interject a lot of bad
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts yeah just grab some super Kim D from
fucker Joe you just got screwed black
[SPEAKER_00]: metal he's one of the reasons we had this
little conversation sorry to hear that but
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it is what it is let's see one
strain you recommend from some recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: from you someone that's never got your
gear before I think about right Barry v3
[SPEAKER_00]: right now like with what's available I'd
say like bubble berry cherry berry any of
[SPEAKER_00]: those just because they're so easy to grow
yeah yeah black metal I mean we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about this a thousand times on this show
yeah so for the people new to it tent flow
[SPEAKER_00]: actually has screenshots if you need to
see them so yeah that dude is not cool at
[SPEAKER_00]: all not cool he's also he doxed me so I
mean he's a dry snitch I don't know why
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody fucking with that dude I made it
real clear real fucking clear about old
[SPEAKER_00]: fucker Joe no I don't an SD cat that would
be a surprise to me never heard of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dude when I was down there yeah in the J
crew to fuck a Ben Sherman man Sherman
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah I mean you know both he's one of
the archivists that I take very seriously
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Bodi radio ridge has been doing an
amazing job of sourcing legit genetics for
[SPEAKER_00]: a long time and even before they even talk
about him they run him through a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people to make sure that they have a legit
cut before they declare having any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: cut which yeah no it's the same guy black
metal you're definitely talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: same idiot another dude let me give you
another example today and this is one that
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably should have fucking slapped
down much harder earlier on where is it
[SPEAKER_00]: where's the fake bull rider oh maybe I
don't have a picture of it ready there's
[SPEAKER_00]: one dude was showing fake pictures of bull
rider is this it that this dude is dude
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody no no San Diego old-schoolers
respect this dude have ever heard of this
[SPEAKER_00]: dude before that he's a complete shithead
he had made claims that he and his partner
[SPEAKER_00]: made Afghani bull rider and he didn't know
that there was a difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani bull rider and original bull rider
so now since he's been made aware of that
[SPEAKER_00]: he's now claiming he has original bull
rider which is dead yeah there is that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is that little situation that is not
alive anymore never mind that though that
[SPEAKER_00]: just details details details yeah that if
anybody wants a real bull rider cut the
[SPEAKER_00]: closest you're gonna get is old Betsy and
old Betsy hybrids right now and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of those available so there's no
reason to even even fuck with someone that
[SPEAKER_00]: stupid heard of PNW strain hunter I have
not I have not where did skunk want to
[SPEAKER_00]: originate from us that's probably the most
known story in the history of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: most documented Sam the skunk man what is
a true DJ to blueberry people say DJ
[SPEAKER_00]: shorts I went through 23 blueberry cuts to
find the one that smells like sour milk
[SPEAKER_00]: and muffins DJ was the one who popularized
the line called blueberry but there have
[SPEAKER_00]: been other cuts called blueberry that
didn't come from his stuff from around the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time so I hopefully that helps what
else we got bullshit writer is correct
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah our ex-farmer that was the Afghani
bull riders referring to not the old bull
[SPEAKER_00]: rider that I had in my backpack back then
it was called bull gunny yeah like metal
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guarantee it's the same dude same dude
we've all been talking about there's
[SPEAKER_00]: people in here who've been ripped off by
that dude that can tell you just as much
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not on my word anyway
[SPEAKER_00]: what are some old clones that are still
around that you would like to get your
[SPEAKER_00]: hands on old clones that are still around
I'd like to get my hands on purple indica
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not even you know what like even
stuff like that via via archive to CSI CSI
[SPEAKER_00]: is super honest with clones and sharing
and it was asked not to share so I've
[SPEAKER_00]: still never grown purple indica pure so
like a clone like that I'd be very
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to think of some other one oh the
corn the corns another one I'd be really
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in see what is the relation of
old Betsy and bull rider sister stock the
[SPEAKER_00]: the the cuts came from the same person so
yeah and guys like Brandon Rust wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know that shit so but I bet after this
he'll be repeating it like it's fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: some shit he always knew see that's a
problem there's there are double-edged
[SPEAKER_00]: swords to putting info out there like this
yeah I ran some metal haze back in the day
[SPEAKER_00]: from Dutch flowers we did some metal haze
crosses it's a very interesting line
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty sure it's positronix haze 19
crossed a skunk one that positronix sold
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time and it was renamed baby
Yoda I've never even heard of baby Yoda to
[SPEAKER_00]: be selling it for a thousand I mean you
know again it's possible to buy clones
[SPEAKER_00]: that are legit but know your sourcing
always ask questions don't just assume
[SPEAKER_00]: like and I get it's very like you want to
be that one dude who can source something
[SPEAKER_00]: and and be like oh I'm the be like I'm the
one who got it yes I'm one of the very few
[SPEAKER_00]: rare people that have this rare cut but
nine times out of ten that's not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: happen it just isn't so Tom Hill haze
skunk one no Tom Hill's haze was a
[SPEAKER_00]: selection from positronix haze 19 but it
probably was nothing like the same female
[SPEAKER_00]: because there were so many different
females so but similar yes have you run
[SPEAKER_00]: much of the legends or chimeras stuff
firstly yeah that was some of my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff back in the day I ran um let's see
from chimeras sassy frass mental floss
[SPEAKER_00]: mental floss was my favorite out of the
chimeras stuff um let's see what else from
[SPEAKER_00]: legends Johnny Blaze legends ultimate
indica there's another one yeah those are
[SPEAKER_00]: the top ones from both of them that I
really really dug how about that archive
[SPEAKER_00]: post dude selling one yeah we talked about
that a little bit ago yeah it's is what it
[SPEAKER_00]: is that's what what kind of is is helping
foster these situations is people like
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know but did oh have a verified
cuts of his elites so have a what have
[SPEAKER_00]: they did was he made it into our circle
and I remember I was talking about people
[SPEAKER_00]: that get into circles and rip people off
and get booted out that's exactly what he
[SPEAKER_00]: did everybody in the circle was very open
with each other and with clones and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: got a lot of clones from everyone in the
group and ripped everyone off and
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately started selling them against
everybody's wishes he's one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: and a perfect example of someone who's a
fucking piece of shit that does that
[SPEAKER_00]: luckily he lost most of them and and some
of me was handed were fake so we can be
[SPEAKER_00]: thankful for that but yeah it's a shame
it's a shame what's the one cut that you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't worked with that you would grab if
you could I'll go with corn on that one
[SPEAKER_00]: just cuz yeah if it was hilarious until he
wasn't I agree he he damaged and burned
[SPEAKER_00]: every bridge he possibly could have
fucking had which made a lot of sense
[SPEAKER_00]: because he when he came to our crew he
didn't really have any friends corn is an
[SPEAKER_00]: old cut for that archive has you'd have to
ask him what what it actually is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: story behind it I don't remember what was
purple pain there were a few different
[SPEAKER_00]: purple pains but purple champagne was
supposed to be the the derb the f1 derb
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been called a thousand different
things so stay trippy who is who is he
[SPEAKER_00]: with the fake Death Star I don't know how
big a fairy phenol variation would you see
[SPEAKER_00]: in chem 91 s ones I haven't run them but
just from observing people pop them online
[SPEAKER_00]: and and talking to CSI it sounds like it
has a fairly good amount of variation
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that looks like sour all the way
that stuff looks like pure Afghani I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what copy genetics is double purple
Doja um I don't that was that's always
[SPEAKER_00]: been pretty rare so if people pop up at
the day I'm always skeptical but Fairfax
[SPEAKER_00]: election according to the icy mag forums
but there's more than one corn on there a
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairfax election I'm not sure it might be
four-way selection could be Jeff take make
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani bull rider I don't know I mean I I
smoked it sold it Afghani bull rider bud
[SPEAKER_00]: but I never really cared because it like
who did what because it wasn't bull rider
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have anything to do with it I don't
think how's the NFL NL preservation
[SPEAKER_00]: project going great going great Death Star
I didn't know El Jefe used a Death Star so
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't know I wouldn't know that shit
from woodshed was ridiculous he brought
[SPEAKER_00]: that to a party I was the first can of
Luminati party and he was just invited in
[SPEAKER_00]: to come to the party and he showed up with
his Death Star he'd been fucking banging
[SPEAKER_00]: on about how dank it was and I took one
look and one smell I was like motherfucker
[SPEAKER_00]: you got skunk one you got skunk one bro
and if you can't tell that you shouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: be trading cuts but yeah I don't know
that's fucking funny yeah that shit was
[SPEAKER_00]: garb though I mean it was okay for skunk
one but you know it wasn't Death Star
[SPEAKER_00]: that's for damn sure didn't Jeff I don't
want it I'm not gonna sit here talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about some fucking nobody the whole time
I'm looking forward to that project to
[SPEAKER_00]: cross the nl5 to one of those p91s well
it's not a bad idea I think that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: very nice like a older Afghani base yeah
that'd be really cool I've already talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about that like I said I'm not gonna keep
bringing up or spending time on a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody but yeah Death Star OG is great too
I'm not sure which one you're referring to
[SPEAKER_00]: or what that is yeah so that's that's a
rough treatise on how you should verify
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts how you go get these cuts yeah it's
really there's not a great shortcut I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry it's not a great shortcut sometimes
it takes years to get a cut and sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll never get it just is what it is you
can't people calling things elites has
[SPEAKER_00]: caused a lot of different ideas about what
these cuts are and how good they are
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is subjective so what I
consider elite may not be what you
[SPEAKER_00]: consider elite but back in the day it was
a consensus value given to stuff if
[SPEAKER_00]: something kept getting passed because
there wasn't thought that in an online
[SPEAKER_00]: hype system and Instagram for pictures and
what's and whatnot if things kept getting
[SPEAKER_00]: passed it was because they were naturally
hyping themselves because they were dank
[SPEAKER_00]: and after a certain point enough people
agreed that this clone is dank that's how
[SPEAKER_00]: you got an elite cut nowadays it's
anything that gets thrown on Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: that some hype schmuck wants you to think
you know is legit okay what do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: the relationship between super skunk and
chem is if any I think chem 91 is a pure
[SPEAKER_00]: super skunk that's just my best guess but
pretty pretty sure on that one first-class
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics is the number one in legit cuts
well I'm glad you know that because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't I don't I don't know that I'm sure
the guy's nice but I just he's not in our
[SPEAKER_00]: circle so I don't know anything about what
he has
[SPEAKER_00]: what's up fatty Gainesville green still
going around I've never seen a real cut of
[SPEAKER_00]: Gainesville green in my life I've seen a
lot of fake cuts of it anything about fire
[SPEAKER_00]: alien ramen that was OD rascal and it was
a seed line oh you have Cuban black haze
[SPEAKER_00]: cool that's what I was talking about like
that incognito guy that's one of the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: he brought to the table along with Ken 3
and fake mass super skunk so yeah y'all
[SPEAKER_00]: getting y'all getting skunked we got some
stuff first class I can fit you in
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely not unhappy that's good see
that's it that's a good good call as long
[SPEAKER_00]: as this stuff you know what it is in the
first place before you get it other way I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean things can be this is where some
confusion also comes in because things can
[SPEAKER_00]: be dank right you can get a fake clone
that's super dank probably even better
[SPEAKER_00]: than the clone only however does that make
it legit you know you have to know them
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to be able to identify something
in the first place before you can verify
[SPEAKER_00]: it yeah you just got to know you have to
know it in advance what's the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: in Amherst sour AJ sour ACSD Amherst sour
new to me I mean like I get like people
[SPEAKER_00]: were saying it was for Amherst so someone
smacked Amherst on the front of a sour cut
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about that sour cut
I only know ECSD the Choco same thing the
[SPEAKER_00]: AJ sour was very dank but what AJ
considers his sour now was nothing like
[SPEAKER_00]: the old AJ sour cut so yeah salt and lime
never heard of that see like the Cuban
[SPEAKER_00]: black case a lot of people like it but is
that what it is I don't know don't know I
[SPEAKER_00]: know where it came from and I know that it
I know the provenance on it and that that
[SPEAKER_00]: guy passed two other fake cuts when he
passed that cut so yeah yeah the archive
[SPEAKER_00]: cut of sour would be the same thing as the
Choco the ECSD etc so those are the same
[SPEAKER_00]: exact cuts if you're comparing archives
versus Choco they're the same cuts who was
[SPEAKER_00]: the original train wreck so the original
train wreck supposedly was nothing like
[SPEAKER_00]: the train wreck that got pushed by a e32
and the arcaded train wreck it was much
[SPEAKER_00]: different before that but the one that
gets past the most is like that lemonade
[SPEAKER_00]: or paneling one and that's what most
people yeah and Mandelkroch put the
[SPEAKER_00]: Amherst on the name and again no surprise
do I think the AJ sour I used was the
[SPEAKER_00]: original sour no I think the Choco ECSD is
the original sour I do but I mean who
[SPEAKER_00]: knows again that's not one we can take
back to the total beginning because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no true there's no true like
agreement between the original guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: had the sour on what that sour is now I
don't think any of them could identify it
[SPEAKER_00]: today by any stretch of the imagination
and we tried we tried to get them to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: so found an incredible train wreck Fino in
bubblegum breath crosses that me why is
[SPEAKER_00]: there a train wreck Fino's in bubblegum
breath crosses that's weird I get maybe I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what bubblegum breath is whole
time is an Amherst that said it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: original sour originally from New York
upstate it is from New York upstate but it
[SPEAKER_00]: was not called Amherst sour no one's ever
called it Amherst sour back then as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it was called our diesel and that's
the original name so yeah I mean people
[SPEAKER_00]: can call whatever they want but they
shouldn't if they're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: original sour it's not super debatable
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly a couple sours at first though
yes yeah yeah and the other original name
[SPEAKER_00]: for it was the Manny from those guys so
there is also that I didn't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo breath is basically a Mendo perps
and train wreck Mendo breath is not Mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: perps and train wreck bro it's OG kush
breath and probably a Mendo perps train
[SPEAKER_00]: wreck but OG kush breath being the main
part of it chem dog had fake chem 91 in
[SPEAKER_00]: high times why would you trust what any of
them say that's hard hard to argue with
[SPEAKER_00]: are there land races that get as commonly
knocked off as ties I don't know on that
[SPEAKER_00]: one I don't know your opinion what
breeders are killing it right now and why
[SPEAKER_00]: a few episodes ago I did a long list of
breeders that are are people that I trust
[SPEAKER_00]: and that are doing some cool shit so yeah
that hit back a few episodes and you could
[SPEAKER_00]: probably find that moon tide that's a good
that's another fair statement like like
[SPEAKER_00]: those those smells don't necessitate a lot
more than most of the things associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with like the skunk tiles and stuff like
that skunky tiles are hermaphroditic
[SPEAKER_00]: tendencies and low potency and that's for
for real but people want what they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know and can't have so many old elites
look like ugly ass plants I guess turps
[SPEAKER_00]: and highs were a bit more important for a
lot of them I think in modern times people
[SPEAKER_00]: equate looking good with dinkness that
would be the Instagram era of growers and
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't agree with that at all not even a
little bit some of the most beautiful shit
[SPEAKER_00]: like blackberry Kush is some of the worst
potency on earth like you know Menopurps
[SPEAKER_00]: is fucking beautiful not super potent you
know but it has great turps yeah there's
[SPEAKER_00]: any name any cookies hybrid I don't think
it's that fucking great but it's pretty so
[SPEAKER_00]: it sells yeah I'm not sure yet pyramid
haven't run any yet that's right Jean Jean
[SPEAKER_00]: knows what's up can't smoke with your
fucking eyes boys
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah it's uh it's like the people that
that run tests and think that's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: example of how to pick your weed and what
to sell by THC volume but you know they
[SPEAKER_00]: did people haven't even looked at the
entourage effect at all hogs breath is a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful example yeah it's not wasn't the
most gorgeous but it was one of those ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that hyped itself because it was fucking
day that's absolutely true name fuck a
[SPEAKER_00]: gene we're gonna get gene on here
eventually eventually he will do it he
[SPEAKER_00]: will do it and come hang out and shoot the
shit do you think microbes and fungi and
[SPEAKER_00]: soil contribute to the flavor of weed I
think the root zone is where it does all
[SPEAKER_00]: that that exchanging of stuff so sure I
think sulfur added sulfur helps with with
[SPEAKER_00]: turps and stuff like that um yeah favorite
chem to smoke I liked chem one because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was so different than the other chems and
I like uh diesel other than that if I were
[SPEAKER_00]: just saying like just chem chems well I
guess that would depend on what chem is
[SPEAKER_00]: right uh chem 91 nl5 haze chem four is one
of my other phase what's a strain that
[SPEAKER_00]: subverted your expectations because of how
ugly it was columbian black it was
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful to me because I knew its
potential but it was just an airy mess of
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny little tiny little bubbles of bud
everywhere but it was it was amazing smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah a lot has a lot of that same look
that that like the columbian black did
[SPEAKER_00]: just stringy you know a lot like what
people called grinspoon that was
[SPEAKER_00]: originally quays what happened to good
widow probably the same thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: happened with everything else in the 90s
people just overdid it got sick of it lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of renames um lots of bad impressions of
weed that was not widow stuff like that
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you feel now that tissue culture
has really started to gain momentum and
[SPEAKER_00]: become more available with honest people
ass fatty I haven't ever since I got
[SPEAKER_00]: screwed by by moony moon dog on on tissue
culturing I've stayed so far away from it
[SPEAKER_00]: and don't care because it's just a bad
experience but I know my boy fatty's been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some some cool shit with it uh dog
walker og is kind of ugly it smokes
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic I think it's kind of pretty it
smokes great though he got he did not get
[SPEAKER_00]: the cut from gray skull Brandon did not
get the cut from gray skull because gray
[SPEAKER_00]: skull doesn't have the fucking cut gray
skull will tell you doesn't have the cut I
[SPEAKER_00]: had the last of gray skulls bull rider
seeds and they weren't gonna pop so they
[SPEAKER_00]: had to take him to a tissue culture guy
not sure what's up with that since then
[SPEAKER_00]: but Brandon did not get shit from fucking
gray skull gray skull would never fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: with that kid god what a see but I mean
and again Brandon rust is a noob but
[SPEAKER_00]: people just think for some reason because
he says he's not that he isn't people are
[SPEAKER_00]: liars you gotta ask the people themselves
why don't you ever smoke weed during lies
[SPEAKER_00]: one I don't want to get him shut down two
I can't answer fast if I'm stoned just
[SPEAKER_00]: can't I've tried a few live and stoned and
that just doesn't work out well so either
[SPEAKER_00]: you want info or you want me stoned one of
the two but you can't have both yeah I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know that gray ever had bull rider
he had the seeds that we had here and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the bag seed and that was that as
far as I know
[SPEAKER_00]: so yeah know what you're talking about
don't just trust people because they say
[SPEAKER_00]: they're legit and old-school and they show
a picture of a plant and veg saying it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something don't don't just accept that is
as true please I beg of you guys don't
[SPEAKER_00]: because it all it does is is fuck
everything up where can I get some cuts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Steve Murphy Afghani I'm sure you can
find someone that'll sell you some Steve
[SPEAKER_00]: Murphy Afghani if you keep asking around
I'm sure Brandon Russ will sell you some
[SPEAKER_00]: of Steve Murphy's Afghani yeah I don't
know anybody currently keeping cuts of
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Murphy's Afghani how is the CSI nl
project going it's going great going great
[SPEAKER_00]: they over grew everything really fast it's
obviously some kind of Afghani hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what we want from a nl5 that
gives more truth to what it's supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be because we are always going to keep
making sure that it is what we think it is
[SPEAKER_00]: do you know what Steve Murphy Afghani is
yeah Afghani or actually that it as it was
[SPEAKER_00]: told to me it could be a Pakistani or
Afghani they weren't sure it was a girl
[SPEAKER_00]: who went over and brought them back to
Steve Murphy so it could be Pakistani or
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani but she was so it was picked up
somewhere along that line weasel with the
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel say sour D came from his headband
siege which is cam 91 nor lights so weasel
[SPEAKER_00]: with the diesel has told so many different
stories respect to him nice dude but I
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard too many different stories
coming out dude's mouth to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable but we do know Vondo and Vondo
has been the most reliable and consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to stories about the sour
and and yeah weasel with the diesel knows
[SPEAKER_00]: Vondo too and they were roommates but he's
been the most consistent and out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spotlight wants nothing to do with any
fame glory from northern or from sour so
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah how is golden coast vintage afghani
it was a short squat little creamy hashy
[SPEAKER_00]: afghani nothing great but uh it was pretty
anything about cause i don't even know who
[SPEAKER_00]: cosmic wisdom is sorry um
[SPEAKER_00]: would we get a shawnee kids he just did an
episode with me how would you describe the
[SPEAKER_00]: nose on instruction on pakistani chitral
kush depending on depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype you can get like blackberry the
green fino showed a lot of lemon and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of turpentine mixed in but
there's other notes too um yeah caleb
[SPEAKER_00]: would be the person i mean csi would be
the person to talk about with that
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere vondo story can be found we
brought vondo into our circle and
[SPEAKER_00]: interviewed him extensively and i just
told it to you so that's about the best
[SPEAKER_00]: place you're going to get it unless you're
friends with them so do you believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: sour cake from head sour came from
headband those guys can't even agree on
[SPEAKER_00]: who named headband let alone um any of it
i've watched several people from that
[SPEAKER_00]: group including ajjj and and maybe one of
them did name it but jj says he's named it
[SPEAKER_00]: aj said he's named it and i believe klopp
said he's named it uh weasel so who knows
[SPEAKER_00]: who knows maybe one of them did maybe one
of them didn't but sour was before that so
[SPEAKER_00]: it would make it very hard for sour to
come from headband how do you pick a name
[SPEAKER_00]: for a strain don't ask me i come up with
dumb ass names if you're if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: autism and you're trying to make friends
and be social for kids that's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty hard um find a group that
understands that i mean we're all i would
[SPEAKER_00]: be hard pressed to find a group of seed
makers that are real serious into this and
[SPEAKER_00]: real serious into collecting that aren't
on the spectrum in some way shape or form
[SPEAKER_00]: um most of my best friends have some level
of autism spectrum blackberry was a bag
[SPEAKER_00]: seeded by soma blaze correct probably
mendo perps um all of it's probably knit
[SPEAKER_00]: mendo perps you can find everything that
they described as blackberry in mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: perps so i'm guessing it's mendo perps bag
seed that they didn't want to admit
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite turpinoline dominant clone um i
really like the amnesia haze uh um
[SPEAKER_00]: columbian black that's another one fly to
portland ship yourself some yeah there you
[SPEAKER_00]: go that's there you go thoughts on breeder
love in her eyes i don't know anything
[SPEAKER_00]: about them they're very new to me i don't
know if they're new to the scene in
[SPEAKER_00]: general but they're very new to me some
pretty pictures though
[SPEAKER_00]: uh no never was blackberry was from
sonny's black russia you're backwards uh
[SPEAKER_00]: black russian was cherry aka 47 new blues
blackberry and he was blackberry was
[SPEAKER_00]: probably from mendo perps what makes an og
and og i know there's so many cuts out
[SPEAKER_00]: there is it just about there being similar
traits and a bag seed story yes roughly
[SPEAKER_00]: yes know anything about the blood derby
ncsis i do not there were a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different blackberry cushions out there
[SPEAKER_00]: uh sonny's black russian it wasn't sonny's
it was um the black russian was nibus
[SPEAKER_00]: nibus so you tried to like the chem one
yes it's very different from um the other
[SPEAKER_00]: chems it's not super what people would
associate with chemi however i think it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be great in a cross with dog shit
because they are both uh in all five haze
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant probably some skunk one in there
too um it i think you'll get more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional dutch um nl5 haze type by
running across of the two than most of
[SPEAKER_00]: what i what other stuff you could buy
right now what are you growing now uh i'll
[SPEAKER_00]: put that on a back burner for now talking
about it just because i don't want people
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that they've made what i just made
so yeah i watched your original diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: episode the other day have you ever ever
seen the forum thread of when chem dog
[SPEAKER_00]: visited subcool at his house yes headband
was one of the strains chem dog had yes
[SPEAKER_00]: and chem dog himself has told me he's
never had headband you know i guess it
[SPEAKER_00]: just depends on what day you ask i like i
like chem dog greg he's a friend i really
[SPEAKER_00]: do but um you know unless you have copious
notes it's been fucking x amount of years
[SPEAKER_00]: he was really young when all that was
going on it's very hard to keep track of
[SPEAKER_00]: any of that urinal cake that sounds lovely
come come smoke some urinal cake with me
[SPEAKER_00]: hockey puck urinal cake but yeah cook hits
that was a good name i agree i think you
[SPEAKER_00]: would really like this super glue cut
afghani northern lights yeah i mean when i
[SPEAKER_00]: see stuff like northern lights in a in a
um in a lineage like that where there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: number to it no nothing and knowing which
northern lights were over here and which
[SPEAKER_00]: ones weren't it are already i mean it
could be super dank but i couldn't ever
[SPEAKER_00]: use it in anything because i just wouldn't
can't chase the provenance on it and i
[SPEAKER_00]: can't say what it is unless it was super
exceptional you know i'd be surprised if
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone remembered anything after fitting
so cool that's true that's true have you
[SPEAKER_00]: ever seen any ethiopian strains making its
way up yeah there's people that uh people
[SPEAKER_00]: people have sold ethiopian strains before
i don't know much about it in that can you
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about do you see us uh well i can't i
didn't understand what you're asking have
[SPEAKER_00]: you smoked the metal haze bode is about to
release i've smoked metal haze plenty and
[SPEAKER_00]: bred with it but i don't know about the
one that he's using uh anything about dr
[SPEAKER_00]: atomic been trying to get him on the the
show we'll see how it goes uh did you get
[SPEAKER_00]: your f1 during back nope not yet any idea
what the harsh chemical spray paint
[SPEAKER_00]: permanent marker fumes type smells could
come from different terpenes combinations
[SPEAKER_00]: of thiols terpenes esters etc who is real
humboldt seed company hso hsc csi well csi
[SPEAKER_00]: is a humble original hsc was the first
person to have humboldt seed co but i have
[SPEAKER_00]: no respect for them for many other reasons
and hso split off i thought i think i may
[SPEAKER_00]: be wrong but as i've heard it's one of the
people split off from humboldt seed co and
[SPEAKER_00]: started humboldt seeds org where does the
african haze come from which african haze
[SPEAKER_00]: there's like senegal haze that was a
combination of two african land races with
[SPEAKER_00]: no haze in it um yeah i don't know yeah
i've been trying i've been working on dr
[SPEAKER_00]: atomic but he's not he's not a big
internet dude so it's been a little um
[SPEAKER_00]: hard but i think it would be i think he'd
be a great person to interview he's been
[SPEAKER_00]: around a long time he's you know made some
cool shit
[SPEAKER_00]: purple man mentioned the clones dot game
were covered in pm those were the days
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah i'm not sure on um i'm not sure on
the african haze from i just i haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: kept up on what what he's been working
with any other questions about um
[SPEAKER_00]: provenance clones genetics in general
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that i might know about have you
tried any transki south african strains i
[SPEAKER_00]: have tried transki tried swazi early in
the early on durban um i wasn't a big fan
[SPEAKER_00]: of south africans if i'm being honest like
they tended to be um high high yielding
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grade for africa which is you
know i dressed up for this i dressed up i
[SPEAKER_00]: dressed up for you
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts on reversal sometimes plants
don't sack up they're more look like
[SPEAKER_00]: bananas normal yeah um different reversals
go different ways did saint george make
[SPEAKER_00]: girl scout cookies absolutely not that's a
bullshit story um but it is a story that
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps being spread nonetheless i've
actually tried to get a hold of him to put
[SPEAKER_00]: his story on the record and they will not
do it will not put it on the record but it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be easily trounced easily um i did
ask the original cookies dudes to uh talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about it and we'll see hopefully they will
hopefully they'll be interested in it what
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene or combo of terpenes make
blueberry smell mercine and then different
[SPEAKER_00]: ever run out any of skunk man's gear back
in the icy mag days yes the um taihei
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk one um what else did i run a fucking
there were a bunch of freebies that were
[SPEAKER_00]: given out by sam the skunk man back in the
day i did run some of the uh the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that they sold through dna is the skunk
train that sam had made too who is on
[SPEAKER_00]: shango los talking about it saint george
or maybe he was just fucking being a dick
[SPEAKER_00]: to me either way he's not the dude um
that's that's it's pretty well documented
[SPEAKER_00]: uh where cookies came from pretty well
documented does a trinity cut you are all
[SPEAKER_00]: using a berry turps no um i think that the
people who made cookies know what it is
[SPEAKER_00]: but don't really um don't really want to
put the full recipe out there i it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to remake cookies so um yeah i've
heard what saint george says it is but
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah i don't know it's one of those things
where uh so many people want to take
[SPEAKER_00]: credit for it that there's so much
bullshit out there what is up with seed
[SPEAKER_00]: stunky that dude's a fucking lop he chose
to go with corporate assholes and uh got
[SPEAKER_00]: booted from our scene of friends because
he just chose to work with snitches and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what happens cherry pie pakistani
chitrali no way in hell no way in hell or
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd find constant turpentine digging all
that up um there's no urkel or og kush in
[SPEAKER_00]: that comment combination so yeah no plants
tell the truth people tell stories i
[SPEAKER_00]: always go back to that cookies was
life-changing oh lord any backstory in
[SPEAKER_00]: starfighter no that was already when i
stopped when that came out i had already
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped paying attention to everything
like that new people were doing any work
[SPEAKER_00]: with you and smellboat on the back burner
no i smell boats been doing his own thing
[SPEAKER_00]: he's you know he's got he's a daddy he's
got life so he hasn't really been um
[SPEAKER_00]: hasn't really been doing much but yeah
he's a good dude one of the friends i hope
[SPEAKER_00]: it'd be nice to see him get back to it
also because he grew really dank we need
[SPEAKER_00]: always bring it to me you think cookies is
og urkel i think there's a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: to it but i think most of these
expressions that you see in cookies is an
[SPEAKER_00]: og urkel combination yeah you know um
eddie leapfrog was responsible for a green
[SPEAKER_00]: sherb that uh that is different than the
cookie fam sherb um one is more
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for skittles one is just not
that's why there's a lot of confusion
[SPEAKER_00]: around that i heard m39 yes skunk one uh
and then another skunk one northern light
[SPEAKER_00]: five haze or just skunk one and all five i
can't remember um i think it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: find things some combo thereof the male
pakistani to trawl was an urkel morph get
[SPEAKER_00]: out of here with that shit yeah out of
that yeah that's fucking silly that is
[SPEAKER_00]: silly basic five is the nl5 version that
sssc was using in m39 yeah nl5 skunk haze
[SPEAKER_00]: i think what's the optimal thd cvd turf
percentage depends on what you want out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it for your body chemistry any thoughts on
dick horse genetics never heard of him
[SPEAKER_00]: never heard of her never heard of her ever
asked the same question over and over even
[SPEAKER_00]: though he keeps passing it i don't know
what you're referring to i'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: catch everything what's about the hardcore
og clone from west coast cuts now i don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know anything about that shit ever try
malawi gold and l5 haze i have not yet not
[SPEAKER_00]: yet what can i expect to find in your
cherry gmo skittles some cherry geo some
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry pies and gmo and some skittles and
everything in between um that's the most
[SPEAKER_00]: honest answer i can give because there's
tons of phenos it's a polyhybrid what regs
[SPEAKER_00]: you got for something you'd recommend any
of the blue bonnet stuff i'm happy with
[SPEAKER_00]: all of it it just depends on what you like
out of weed that's the the most honest
[SPEAKER_00]: answer i can give you know best way to
stabilize a herm that's a winner it just
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on the actual clump um it depends
on what you want to get out of it if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want an uh something that is as close to
that clone as possible it's going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of breeding what out of your current
language your current go-to when you smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: who i really like the cherry berry a lot
um um the blue resin kush is fucking bomb
[SPEAKER_00]: um i'm a big fan of blue like berry ogs
and stuff i think they combine really well
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you get that like fruit
loops if you know out of the og pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: some berry that's some beautiful shit how
do you stabilize a herm it depends on the
[SPEAKER_00]: line it's not there's no just one method
for stabilizing all herms herms things
[SPEAKER_00]: herm for different reasons in different
lines and different combinations the
[SPEAKER_00]: volubicus i too love blue bubba too how
did bode make appalachia he did not uh
[SPEAKER_00]: high and lonesome made the appalachia and
that was green crap crossed a trade dog
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody knows the true origin of the
skittles jean would know he's up there
[SPEAKER_00]: with those dudes it's up for debates
apparently i know some people are more
[SPEAKER_00]: confident about confident about it than
others can you talk about bubble gum and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it got to holland um victor if i
remember correctly victor was the dude
[SPEAKER_00]: that brought it over the seeds you can
find it on adam dunn's 25th anniversary of
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble gum i think that's when they had
victor and um two trees on and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: the most legitimate as far as i know the
most legitimate story that has been given
[SPEAKER_00]: about that would you say seed finder.u has
legit info sometimes i mean anybody could
[SPEAKER_00]: add any info i've never added a single
strange seed finder and all my shit's up
[SPEAKER_00]: there and a lot of it's wrong so anybody
could add info up there and if anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: could add info up there then there's bound
to be right and wrong i don't that
[SPEAKER_00]: illinois bubble gum story is kind of
suspect i don't that was not a victor
[SPEAKER_00]: story that was an adam dunn story so i
don't i don't buy that so is there an
[SPEAKER_00]: appalachia male appalachia was a seed line
so yeah there were males females there was
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of stuff i think it's a f4 f4
last buy high and lonesome whose dick do i
[SPEAKER_00]: gotta suck for some legit green crack s1s
i i made some back in the day and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: could find someone with those they're
legit um i don't know i might make some
[SPEAKER_00]: more soon we'll see but uh green crack is
much harder to source than it was at one
[SPEAKER_00]: time i have seen so much green crack and
so much fake green crack since gene's 100
[SPEAKER_00]: confident that nobody knows well then your
gene knows he's there he's in that friend
[SPEAKER_00]: circle of everyone that was fucking around
with uh the trays and and the the green
[SPEAKER_00]: sherb and all that shit what strains are
great for headaches and he it just depends
[SPEAKER_00]: on your brain chemistry i'd love to give
people answers like that but i just
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't be honest to just be like yeah
this will work for it you know are you
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna bring back the purple drink back
wasn't it gsc it was gsc cross to let's
[SPEAKER_00]: see you know i don't remember them all
minute but i know it was during the shug
[SPEAKER_00]: night og cross to the west coast dog uh
trying to remember them all minute it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been a long time what is fake green crack
usually not real green crack it's a green
[SPEAKER_00]: crack's pretty easily easy to identify
visually or smoking wise
[SPEAKER_00]: is green sherb also called key lime pie
some people call it that some people say
[SPEAKER_00]: they're the same thing i've only ever had
key lime pie i've never had anything in my
[SPEAKER_00]: hands called green sherb so i don't know
uh not sure you might know that one better
[SPEAKER_00]: butterscotch g-13 g-13 wasn't around when
the butterscotch wine was passed around
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was a g-13 hash plant that was
as anyone yes dooky rose kettles ghittles
[SPEAKER_00]: yes that's the one that csi uses that is
the skittles cut that i know that i've
[SPEAKER_00]: used it's uh not a very healthy looking
plant it's a little wiry and wrangly i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you think gene on the on the dooky
brothers i defer to guys like gene and and
[SPEAKER_00]: and csi that are up in that area because
they are actually interacting with those
[SPEAKER_00]: folks down on the ground there and seeing
things like down on the ground and they'd
[SPEAKER_00]: be much better to answer those questions
specifically than myself that's gittles
[SPEAKER_00]: cut sucks i'm not gonna lie that thing's a
piece of shit um i get why people like it
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is terpy but it just structure
wise it's a piece of shit who's got
[SPEAKER_00]: skywalker og who knows now i've seen a
million different skywalker ogs isn't key
[SPEAKER_00]: lime pie sister to thin mint yes it
depends who you ask uh vg twizzard any
[SPEAKER_00]: insight on the green curry cut it sounds
like whatever he had is the green curry
[SPEAKER_00]: cut was the same thing that we had as
diabolo og down in san diego um it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like a spicy black peppery with og turps
it was very specific i tried the original
[SPEAKER_00]: chili verde that actually smelled like
chili verde back in the day from hbk it
[SPEAKER_00]: was bomb it was unique very very fucking
unique um there's other chili type plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in the gmo cherry skittles but yeah that
was cool
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah that chili verde was was tight old
school spice life blockhead no lineage was
[SPEAKER_00]: it project 19 what was that african
something project 19 it's been a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: since i've been asked that what's up with
a g hbk i haven't talked to him um a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: in a while but i need to get back a hold
of him i should probably give him a call
[SPEAKER_00]: we live close together and we've been
friends for quite a while um i guess
[SPEAKER_00]: burning bush nursery said key lime came
from them and it's a gse fino hash plant
[SPEAKER_00]: looking thing huh i don't know i released
s1s of the the the key lime pie cut they
[SPEAKER_00]: were very very frosty but they did look
like they looked very skittlesy and the
[SPEAKER_00]: skittles looked very similar to that that
the cut that came from jodri i will say
[SPEAKER_00]: that he's been bumming oh that sucks man
yeah i'll give him a call
[SPEAKER_00]: males and world phylo taxi what gives i
see it often on males in some lines
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically chem 91 pckf2 it's
interesting um it's not like necessarily a
[SPEAKER_00]: male trait but maybe it's something from
those uh specific genetic being combined
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite shitty strain there you go ortega
sweet ortega sweet tooth but what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: where's the project 19 in it in blockhead
is it project 19 ortega sweet tooth that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be what it is that might be what it
is but i remember ortega sweet tooth you
[SPEAKER_00]: are correct about that being in it wasn't
that louis so is it p19 louis louis being
[SPEAKER_00]: legends ultimate indica since that's what
ortega sweet tooth is i can't remember i
[SPEAKER_00]: can't remember at all or is it just p19
sweet tooth
[SPEAKER_00]: is ghetto skunk one dominant no not in
structure at all um turps i can see some
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk one in it but i wouldn't say it's
skunk one dominant as far as like the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression the structure or any of that
cream sotica cream sotica was from that's
[SPEAKER_00]: a spice of life one too no no
[SPEAKER_00]: that's right fatty you guys did grow a
bunch of the blockhead they had um who was
[SPEAKER_00]: it was chrome's cut chrome chrome from
swamp boys had an amazing cut of blockhead
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing i think that's the one that was
down there with um tiara rojo's crew it
[SPEAKER_00]: was cool i like that that cut of blockhead
nigerian silk i'm not i never tried
[SPEAKER_00]: nigerian silk or any of it so i couldn't
comment did burning bush i have no clue on
[SPEAKER_00]: that when it comes to the the progenitors
of like key lime pie and that stuff i have
[SPEAKER_00]: no clue have you ever had any main go cuts
yeah i had a bc mango cut mango haze old
[SPEAKER_00]: betsy's kind of mango ish um green crack
is very mango yeah a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of mango what was the highway man i
can't remember that one what's that
[SPEAKER_00]: district uh homegrown best guess on
closest relative to which
[SPEAKER_00]: tk star dog oh that's interesting blue dot
that was an old uh collective clone for a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain place and i remember there was a
second blue dot that came out i don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what was used in um dutch flowers uh blue
dot stuff that was made to make used to
[SPEAKER_00]: make blowfish not so headband la kush
