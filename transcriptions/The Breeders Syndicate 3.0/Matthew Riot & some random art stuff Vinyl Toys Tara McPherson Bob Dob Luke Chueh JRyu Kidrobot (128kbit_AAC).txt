[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everyone so the past few weeks I've
been showing some of the art and different
[SPEAKER_00]: toys and stuff my collection as I've been
rearranging our whole house and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: put everything together from the last move
you know and I just figured I'd share some
[SPEAKER_00]: of it because most of the stuff people
don't get to see and I take no claim to
[SPEAKER_00]: ownership of any of this so yeah don't use
it against me anywhere anyway this one I
[SPEAKER_00]: put up earlier this was a find at a I want
to say Salvation Army or Goodwill in Point
[SPEAKER_00]: Loma and as you can see I've been trying
to Jenga stack a bunch of the toys we have
[SPEAKER_00]: some amazing Bob Dob stuff over here the
Valsketeers these are like it's pillhead
[SPEAKER_00]: volume head type things some arcane
divination stuff from Jay Ryu different
[SPEAKER_00]: peak holes so Nathan Oda tons of core
stuff all throughout here some kid robot
[SPEAKER_00]: of course some punk rock toys got the CBGB
ones more arcane divination just weird I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know yeah I'm a weirdo whatever of
course but I was opening up this print box
[SPEAKER_00]: of prints and different art and I saw some
cool things in here so I just you know
[SPEAKER_00]: there I bust out the camera leg after it
so here we have something from Bob from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Chiefs when after he passed his wife
sent me this with the purchase they were
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting money for stuff and I bought
some records Brian Ewing a famous
[SPEAKER_00]: skateboard artist he's an odd poster
artist he's done just all kinds of amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff yeah some of these skateboards you
might recognize from my collection one of
[SPEAKER_00]: my favorite artists of all time right now
he's has a battle going on with stage four
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer so please give him a follow show
him support and love this is an amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: artist amazing one of my favorites of all
time all right oh there's one of the picks
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the picks from the Chiefs if you're
a punk rock fan that's kind of cool right
[SPEAKER_00]: we have some stuff from Chris Reniac and
Amanda Louise Spade I don't remember which
[SPEAKER_00]: one did these in particular usually you
can see a little bit of the difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: their styles that's Amanda it should be
Reniac maybe it's Amanda it's so hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell Chris Reniac I think this is
definitely a Reniac right here and these
[SPEAKER_00]: are like special edition prints I think of
some sort they're thick and then these
[SPEAKER_00]: ones I have several of them so most of
them are framed though from Reniac and I
[SPEAKER_00]: just you yeah I'm weird I even like cute
shit don't tell anyone still tough there's
[SPEAKER_00]: an old flyer for one of their shows some
Jermaine oh where is it there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: Jermaine Rogers art and the deaf tones I
love this stuff especially as rabbits like
[SPEAKER_00]: holding each other hostage some of my
favorite part move that so you can't see
[SPEAKER_00]: anything lewd and lascivious
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not in here though it's on the wall
here's a cool one this is from my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: filth off Twitter it's a watercolor mixed
media original and basically he just put
[SPEAKER_00]: up a thing saying like hey if you're
interested in any art just let me know
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll draw you something and it's actually
really phenomenal the dude does phenomenal
[SPEAKER_00]: work and I'm a big fan now and yeah and
this is like stuff in hand and then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a certificate of authenticity too
just kidding um here's an old original
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter Max envelope from the 60s or 70s I'm
not sure which they're probably 60s late
[SPEAKER_00]: 60s early 70s oh expo 74 there you go um
Luke Chu autograph grief encounters I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know I really I really admired Luke
and his work um I have seen one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: boxes right here is one of his um pairs
but the guy guy wasn't terribly nice I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean like I spent a lot of money on his
stuff and we're trying to you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: always want to connect with people and
there's just no way to connect with this
[SPEAKER_00]: dude for me so it kind of ruined a lot of
the art for me anyway um yeah Tara
[SPEAKER_00]: McPherson she does amazing work Prince a
big fan of hers I am as well I love the
[SPEAKER_00]: color she uses and the like her style her
whole style is beautiful everything she
[SPEAKER_00]: does I like her her perspective let's see

[SPEAKER_00]: this one's signed let's see that one's so
beautiful oh me oh better move it up yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: very beautiful very very beautiful these
are some big ones I need to get these in
[SPEAKER_00]: frames I don't know what they're doing out
of the frame can signed that one this

signed Bob Dobb print of this and I have
[SPEAKER_00]: the much bigger version I don't can't

[SPEAKER_00]: fox what else we got this is a cool one
little punk rocker and this is cool it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like the it's a newspaper for the the
Masketeer army and like these statues are
[SPEAKER_00]: some of my favorite statues ever and two
of them broke in the earthquake I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: had and then I ordered them right after we
moved and they got shipped to the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: house to replace them so I just never got
them again yeah that's a plumber because I
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely loved the Masketeers so yeah
they're still kind of broken it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: that um it says something from Tokyo Jesus
