[SPEAKER_03]: Then a new lesson in goddamn See it only
lets me search or send invites.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got to wait till let me see I can
at least get chimera in here So I'll have
[SPEAKER_03]: Crip I'll have kip hit do a request once
it gets in here and that's how it'll work
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm gonna have to have him send a
request to join I got chimeras,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I have to wait till kips does So I can
hit them both in at the same time because
[SPEAKER_03]: when I go to that screen it immediately
after it's done it will make it so I can't
[SPEAKER_03]: touch anything on the screen to add anyone
in or even have Comment or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just freezes the phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Hopefully one more time is all we need
Whenever it gets in here, let me know
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to keep doing you dirty guys Yeah,
you can do up to four people but I have to
[SPEAKER_03]: get oh good I get someone to boot Already
screenshot and video That's how we do that
[SPEAKER_03]: one Kip
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're waiting for kip anybody got any
questions Anything you want to be asking?
[SPEAKER_03]: the legend seats crew Get them ready get
the good questions ready Should only be a
[SPEAKER_03]: moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully Who's that with that fast?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know who did I move?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was no buddy Highland Mexican

[SPEAKER_03]: indica question
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if I can do it this way real
quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's only showing the requests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see It's not an order.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm still looking for kip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully defined if he's in here
[SPEAKER_03]: It always makes it better when you can
have the whole crew if we can pull it off
[SPEAKER_03]: Not here yet Yeah, dude boomin boomer I'm
a straight boomer when it comes to
[SPEAKER_03]: electronics apparently Okay, well should
we just run with chimera Let's do it so we
[SPEAKER_03]: can get this jamming And hopefully
Hopefully if kip does come in we can try
[SPEAKER_03]: to add him in I might be able to do it
that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we're already getting
questions about legends ultimate indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, did you work on that one at all?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was kip and Steve.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's really it was kip did it Yeah,
that was rogue bot and he asked that I saw
[SPEAKER_06]: him Chirping away there.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's really smart good grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys should follow him.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're not already does some really
interesting shit Definitely the ultimate
[SPEAKER_06]: indica Such a classic fucking story,
you know back in the day When they were
[SPEAKER_06]: getting switch one off the ground The you
know, the the the what was it?
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess when they call it ended up calling
a sweet two three But it was like a third
[SPEAKER_06]: back cross to the grapefruit, you know,
kind of like I say, you know, you know
[SPEAKER_06]: breeders that don't know what they're
doing they kind of rely heavily on
[SPEAKER_06]: backcrossing hope that that just hoping
that that solves it solves it all out and
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, you know kip was owned legends and
he Steve actually owned a part of legends
[SPEAKER_06]: at that point in time And so, you know kip
was over there working in Switzerland at
[SPEAKER_06]: the warehouse in the field and he was
supposed to get paid you know a big chunk
[SPEAKER_06]: of The compensation was in those sweet two
three beans that had been really hyped up
[SPEAKER_06]: for a year because Stephen had Steve
hadn't been working right?
[SPEAKER_06]: He kind of was like yeah, I was a game out
of stock and that was the much anticipated
[SPEAKER_06]: release and so You know kip had suspected
that he would be getting knows what he was
[SPEAKER_06]: promised was he'd be getting a large
portion of the sweet three seeds that were
[SPEAKER_06]: to be pre-marketed so he could just turn
around and sell those things and When they
[SPEAKER_06]: were loading up when they were loading up
the room, I guess they had a few extra
[SPEAKER_06]: lights like maybe you know, like 10 15
percent of the lights in the room Where
[SPEAKER_06]: they didn't have enough grapefruit plants
to go in so he took the or take they had
[SPEAKER_06]: all these Ortega plants that were Stick
around that had Rosenthal had brought over
[SPEAKER_06]: to Switzerland or sorry he brought over
the genetic and then mom them up and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know had these plants and so kids said
well, why don't we just why don't we toss
[SPEAKER_06]: these in the room?
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the space.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's toss these these Ortega
plants in and make an F1 hybrid and When
[SPEAKER_06]: the crop finally came down You know Steve
said to kip I'm gonna pay you in these
[SPEAKER_06]: untested F1 hybrid seeds rather
[SPEAKER_06]: Pre work and those ones were pre sold
really Yeah, but instead he got those the
[SPEAKER_06]: the Ortega sweet two three F1 hybrid or F1
type hybrid and so he came back to Canada
[SPEAKER_06]: and he had a couple of shows here and they
threw a bunch of They threw a bunch of the
[SPEAKER_06]: what became the LUI in that room to test
them out and grow Before they sold them
[SPEAKER_06]: and they turned out to be actually quite
banger plants like they really are Some
[SPEAKER_06]: real F1 hybrid figure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't love the flavor on them,
but it was like, you know, it was a
[SPEAKER_06]: growers plant Like it made fucking
incredible hash so So my heady bread is
[SPEAKER_06]: saying the LUI sampled from sativa sisters
in 2004 was covered in large trichromas
[SPEAKER_06]: that would smell all over the plate when
broken up Heavy stone that was the cut
[SPEAKER_06]: that they called we had a calling Red's
pick Which is always that red pick?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was the one And it was it's you
know, like dude, it was an amazing plant
[SPEAKER_06]: like it really I don't actually it was an
amazing plant It was amazing growing
[SPEAKER_06]: planet and you you know You'd lock the
tops off the off the thing at six weeks
[SPEAKER_06]: because they were so big and beefy that
you'd have mold if you didn't So yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: that kind of became the cash croppers
method is you come in and lock the tops
[SPEAKER_06]: off them at six weeks And then give the
the rest like another ten days or whatever
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and Yeah, really popular clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean shit, dude that guy ended up they
had a clone has as well and Like it,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, they sold trays and trays and
trays that clone that thing for well over
[SPEAKER_06]: a year And it made all over the place So
yeah Yeah, interesting interesting plant
[SPEAKER_06]: in seed form Pretty well like I think I
would think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it took like six or eight
months before it really caught on,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, you know, it is yeah,
it takes a cycle for someone to go through
[SPEAKER_06]: it and then You know, you got it,
you know, so you send out 20 30 packs of
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds Yeah, really it takes one person
that has a really good job.
[SPEAKER_06]: That does a good job with it, too Yeah,
that's that kind of makes it roll and by
[SPEAKER_06]: that point in time.
[SPEAKER_06]: They really did roll and they were they
started selling well and Yeah Here's one
[SPEAKER_03]: for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moon tide says chimera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think you could Be bringing back
the blueberry of DJ's heyday the more
[SPEAKER_03]: sativa side.
[SPEAKER_06]: I Probably not in the same way that he
could I mean, you know what it's like it's
[SPEAKER_06]: like, yeah You know, you might have them
like an impression of your buddy's
[SPEAKER_06]: girlfriend, but you're never gonna know
Yeah, right
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something that DJ's got his own
vision of what it is And you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that to get close to what he's
doing You know, he'd be the person to go
[SPEAKER_06]: back and find something that was close to
what it was We've put out a couple of
[SPEAKER_06]: things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean in our blueberry hybrid lines like
the the fighting Buddha and then you know
[SPEAKER_06]: the Dolce line I Would probably go down
those paths more Than try to go down like
[SPEAKER_06]: what to work back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what people Yeah, that makes sense
Yeah, I hunted down the I hunted down the
[SPEAKER_03]: the The blue bonnet path this last time
which is the more Afghani type and I
[SPEAKER_03]: always had it in my head that Because most
of the examples that I'd seen that were
[SPEAKER_03]: super blueberry muffin smelling Typically
were more narrow leaf type plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that I was not gonna see it as
prevalent in the Afghani type But I saw it
[SPEAKER_03]: more prevalent in the Afghani type from
that specific line.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really interesting Yeah,
I think that those Those generalizations
[SPEAKER_06]: that were put on the the line like we you
know, we read about like the moon time the
[SPEAKER_06]: old-time moonshine essentially be Oh,
yeah You know the frosty and again,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's not necessarily clear cut like that
what you'll find no again because they're
[SPEAKER_06]: all siblings or half siblings you kind of
find little bits of each Other in every
[SPEAKER_06]: line, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're more predominantly like like
the old-time moonshine is more
[SPEAKER_06]: predominantly like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah Yeah, did you get to run through
any of them moonshine rocket fuel?
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I did I couldn't remember what era he
did that That was one of the first
[SPEAKER_06]: releases that he did and it was like right
off the bat right off the bat They were
[SPEAKER_06]: like in limited supply.
[SPEAKER_06]: I Worked with him but we you know,
I was one of the early clients to be
[SPEAKER_06]: buying pollen from him He you know,
he had stood up these things and was gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: be selling pollen and so I said like a
bunch of money early on for that and Like
[SPEAKER_06]: the stuff that showed up it was so poorly
packaged Yeah, like you just do we
[SPEAKER_06]: couldn't have been made a bit like in my
opinion there was no business there and He
[SPEAKER_06]: ended up replacing one with a bunch of the
blue most of the satellite Number two,
[SPEAKER_06]: so I got like 150 of those in exchange for
the pollen didn't work and we grew a bunch
[SPEAKER_06]: of them in California It was still pretty
fucking in breath like it was still weak
[SPEAKER_06]: and we found a couple of really nice like
Again, not nice plants, but the plants
[SPEAKER_06]: that had nice variegation in them Yeah,
like really it's a really interesting kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of phenotypical patterns, but nothing That
was banging and you know, like I said we
[SPEAKER_06]: tested all that stuff to it ran it through
the lab and it all came back at like It
[SPEAKER_06]: all came back at like, you know 8 to 12
percent, which is pretty low, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, so You know like and I think
that that's actually where the DJ gets the
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you hear people talking about
that kind of cerebral headspace.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah I think that that actually is a
result not of the terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_06]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually a result of the low
cannabinoid content I think when you like
[SPEAKER_01]: when you you know Yeah, my technical
abilities at this stage in a week are
[SPEAKER_01]: really limited guys
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my my first one of these ever so I
feel I feel so great, you know Venerable,
[SPEAKER_04]: so be gentle I feel like I should just lob
questions up all night.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean Kip is you know, he disappeared
from the scene for a while, but You know,
[SPEAKER_06]: he hasn't really I don't think you've ever
really gotten your dues for the amount of
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff that you put in I know it's not
about ego or Becoming popular or anything
[SPEAKER_06]: like that for it for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You do it out of love for the plant But
man, you've done some pretty epic stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: back in the day and like I was telling
Matt earlier, you know the work that
[SPEAKER_06]: you're doing with shelter and helping them
get that company off the ground and buying
[SPEAKER_06]: hundreds of kilos making pre-rolls and
sell them across the market means They're
[SPEAKER_06]: the consumers are lucky in Canada to have
that kind of shit because you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: as you know, the game is pretty weak
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's nice to see people that are out
there Making making a change and actually
[SPEAKER_06]: putting stuff out.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a reasonable price and it gets good
reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Guys, I mean I have a dream job I am
one of the most fortunate people that I
[SPEAKER_01]: know I'm humbled every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I guys I get to buy weed for a
living and pay taxes It's a trip and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a trip And that said I get to see the good
the bad the ugly across this beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: country of ours and what's going on and
man the you know the fake news that some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these small outfits get and and when
they come into the scene and are Trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: spread their flower and just like yeah,
it's so tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all the cards are stacked so far
against this here right now that you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what i'm loving is finding small bands of
villages that bind together and help each
[SPEAKER_01]: other out through processors and vendors
and distributors and And just you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody kind of pat each other on the
back and trying to lift each other up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But uh, the ankle biters will succeed in
the end Yeah, yeah, it does tend to
[SPEAKER_06]: happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So great garden says most wreck in canada
is booth though What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not you know, here's the problem why
somebody would say that The provinces they
[SPEAKER_01]: really they they like they capture
everything in that province that you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: get national distribution It's next to
impossible from you know, newfoundland to
[SPEAKER_01]: victoria to get the same weed across and
and to get someone's vision out There it's
[SPEAKER_01]: so regionalized and it's ridiculous
because if you think about the taxation
[SPEAKER_01]: the vague that the province Put on as far
as you know, the warehousing and the
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution that they are obviously aware
of uh, or sorry that they are obviously a
[SPEAKER_01]: part of um, you know It's it's like their
own little fighters like their own little
[SPEAKER_01]: countries each it's like uh, you know
having 12 countries in a massive continent
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have to deal with Uh,
it's so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you get a micro cultivator
That pumps out maybe 30 40 kg a month and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, where's that go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that gets eaten up by one province in
a matter of like six weeks if it's fire,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's gone and man There's some
good weed out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some amazing growers out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's 200 micros plus in in canada
right now And so are you telling me that
[SPEAKER_01]: all legal weeds buff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just by the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's bullshit I mean I know better
i've i've puffed it i've seen the grows
[SPEAKER_01]: i've Walked in that and those in those
guys footsteps along the way When shelter
[SPEAKER_01]: first got their first micro that was gourd
from north 40 and he was the first micro
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis that was branded under his name
in canada And you know now we've got 240
[SPEAKER_01]: two years later, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a trip You know, yeah, dude What now
what what qualifies someone as a micro
[SPEAKER_03]: license in canada?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the qualifications for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so a micro license is 2125 so
basically you can only have 2125 square
[SPEAKER_01]: feet of canopy in your facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, gotcha That includes your moms your
clones your cuts your production plants
[SPEAKER_01]: all that kind of stuff Um, but I mean the
good ones know how to do it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about following the plant knowing
your genetics Knowing your uh system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah And and implementing the shit,
you know, I got a micro up here man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's almost pumping out like On average
probably 60 kg a month out of that canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just about the special sauce and
the formula Shocking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all kush, but you know, yeah,
right, right Yeah, it's it's knowing your
[SPEAKER_03]: strains knowing how they're going to
express in that particular environment
[SPEAKER_01]: making them shine for what you have That's
it and also having an understanding for
[SPEAKER_01]: what the market needs to yeah That's part
of it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, um, it's not like we are all back in
the day growing mad warehouses and
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing In some truck into the void.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly You know, um, we actually
have to be responsible for what we put out
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey that a bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right, right The collapse in the
market that we've seen in the u.s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh There's a collapse in the shit part of
the market for sure But like you're in the
[SPEAKER_03]: u.s.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like I mean things are hitting really
low numbers all across the board like 350
[SPEAKER_03]: for For uh last I saw anyways just 350 for
depths, which is insane for pounds So
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I mean, you know, I don't feel so
bad canada's got the cheapest legal weed
[SPEAKER_00]: in the entire globe, man You're not gonna
get some strings plugged for you guys come
[SPEAKER_03]: on How do you guys make that work up there
it's just Doing it right just you do it
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's that great question money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah You know Efficiencies of scale
smaller drops straighter lines uh less
[SPEAKER_01]: government bureaucracy as much as before
and Uh, the fact is is that that's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a slow arduous process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, I've said this before one of the
greatest fucking Injustices that's going
[SPEAKER_01]: on right now is the excise tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the federal excise tax It's a buck
a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and on top of that I mean I can go
on to the five layers of tax that go into
[SPEAKER_01]: this bloody plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a big It's egregious one
because that was based on wholesale
[SPEAKER_01]: pricing be at ten dollars a gram Well,
that ain't the wholesale pricing these
[SPEAKER_01]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: No No So we're getting you're getting
screwed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the government makes 450 a gram
where where a producer could make a buck
[SPEAKER_01]: like It's fucking criminal So anyways,
the fact is is that in order to excuse or
[SPEAKER_01]: to change an excise tax in any level in
canada Takes an act of parliament.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah So that ain't happening anytime soon,
you know, yeah until we get Lobbyists an
[SPEAKER_01]: association getting everyone together and
backed like every other goddamn industry
[SPEAKER_01]: has to push their agenda to push Their
goodwill and their message to the rest of
[SPEAKER_01]: the canadians But you're not going to get
that when you've got large corporations
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you've got the small guys all the
mid guys are being They're being wasted
[SPEAKER_01]: and their order being bought up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the half and a half knots It's you
know, small culture big company is playing
[SPEAKER_01]: out in canada in an exponential way like a
video game Yeah, and so I mean it's coming
[SPEAKER_01]: down south soon You know, the only reason
might it's not legal there yet because
[SPEAKER_01]: they haven't figured out how to take all
the money That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah You really need lobbyists to make any
kind of headway anywhere when it comes to
[SPEAKER_03]: government and taxes And any of it and I
think being that we're all a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: Cowboys, it's just not our specialty to be
fucking with lobbyists.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's new Yeah, you know what we're We're
the we're the we're the giants that the
[SPEAKER_01]: next generation will say that they stood
on our shoulders as we For the guys in the
[SPEAKER_01]: 70s before us and you know back in the day
So we all have a part in this long story
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're this chapter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey brothers and sisters We got it
legalized Okay, so next step take it
[SPEAKER_01]: further, you know Let's get hemp is is the
only thing that should be being grown
[SPEAKER_01]: across the nation to save us from you know
utter global Dissolve as it was so I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go on and on but yeah, I'm just I'm
excited to be a part of it I love what I
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to meet so many cool people all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feel very lucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all Well, we're glad to have you do
Let's let's let's ask Kip some stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: Chimera that like talk about some of the
bigger lines He's been a part of that they
[SPEAKER_06]: can still see today so they understand who
he is Yeah, I mean it was such a period of
[SPEAKER_06]: time and I think a lot of people missed it
but I mean legends you guys had all these
[SPEAKER_06]: really interesting little ones like the
Johnny blaze and You had a time warp
[SPEAKER_06]: blueberry line for a short period of time
and what else is a honeybee that Renee
[SPEAKER_06]: crossed the high end
[SPEAKER_01]: I got so I got the last of the 12 scenes
in Neville's Hayes that are in from
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenhouse had and his personal stash I
picked him up Yeah, Ariane was a true
[SPEAKER_01]: friend and I don't give a shit about what
everybody's preconditions Thoughts might
[SPEAKER_01]: have been about that cat back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was nothing but kind to us a Ryan in
our crew and the People we had around us
[SPEAKER_01]: at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was generous with his time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a wealth of knowledge and he was an
ambassador to a land we knew much not much
[SPEAKER_01]: about back when we were young to us
running around Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Yeah, he was just a good person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, we used to sell the seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So through great Canadian seeds and the
Amsterdam Cafe and legends So we would go
[SPEAKER_01]: over to Amsterdam, you know four or five
times a year to go buy seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of many many dinners and good
times with the boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but he ended up gifting me the last
12 Neville's Hayes he had from when he got
[SPEAKER_01]: them from the man and so I used those to
cross DJ's daddy from the second line that
[SPEAKER_01]: we did to the True Blue and they have 13
the moonshine and the same daddy with with
[SPEAKER_01]: the Neville's Hayes we called it Johnny
Blaze and it's sad that I never personally
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll be honest never got to run any of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so sad, but We sure sent the pile
out and our brothers and OG a lot of guys
[SPEAKER_01]: screw them out and man I mean,
I just felt like they're so proud to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the stuff came out beautiful You
know when you can pick like six brackets
[SPEAKER_01]: off and just roll them in a paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I still have some of those seeds and
I actually used it in a project with the
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberry cream line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So still Maddie had that turn out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to recreate the strawberry
cream because it was a clone at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only knew it as a clone from Cedar Berry
Farms and I was trying to recreate it and
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed in the room that it was next to
the old Blue Dream Santa Cruz cut and I
[SPEAKER_03]: noticed like looking at them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could barely tell any difference and
the nose was only slightly more strawberry
[SPEAKER_03]: in the strawberry cream, but I have a lot
of the similar smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like if I want to create this I
need a mail that's going to be something
[SPEAKER_03]: similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went for the Johnny Blaze and that
line still sold today and it's awesome
[SPEAKER_03]: dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of my favorite lines ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we made those seeds they went 16 and
a half weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah actually maybe it was a full 17.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember that and they were little
pins too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely those are fun days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were living beside an NHL player in a
grow house on the west side of the side of
[SPEAKER_00]: Vancouver when we made those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were good days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fortunate to have been around a pile
of different guys that had really tasty
[SPEAKER_01]: cuts and mentors like Dan DJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was everything to me in my career and
just in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: He taught me so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Uncle Danny to us all for a while
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty cool man.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite one that we ran was the high
end.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the Rene Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never got to try that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always wanted to try.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Rene still around?
[SPEAKER_01]: The original cut I don't have my hands on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing hurt me back like 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't imagine.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually that plant as hyped as it
got.
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually had some really negative
traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you'd be growing it at week seven.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would shoot a banana and then just
ripen.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would just kind of stop growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a really weird one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some funk is asking about the Mexican
Guerrero.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get into that in a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted Kip to speak on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone was asking about Garrett and the
work that he did with the seed bank
[SPEAKER_06]: originals.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you talk on the seed bank originals
and the origin of all that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let that out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe just send a personal story on with
Garrett.
[SPEAKER_06]: Garrett was such a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He reminded me of Weird Al Yankovic in a
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the fourth member of Rush.
[SPEAKER_06]: Garrett, for those that don't know,
was a magnus seed company that ended up
[SPEAKER_06]: being bought up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And kind of consumed and worked into the
Sirius Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Magnus, that's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to remember what it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like Motivation, Warlock,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Warlock was his big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the hammer of his entire
collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like Sensei Seed Skunk 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: That predominated for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beginning of the Canadian scene up
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Warlock, what was the other one?
[SPEAKER_01]: He had that kind of ecotorial leaning one,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember his lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a long time since I've actually
seen it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a great story on Garrett.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad was doing a stage in Paris for a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I decided to go see my dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was staying at a an old monk villa
right below Saint Michel Square.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were hanging out in Paris and doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, Dad, I got a little business in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: The year before is when we had gone and
taken all the weed from Switzerland up to
[SPEAKER_01]: the High Times Cup and entered and gotten
third for that last beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mercy third.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had got a bunch of weed up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a bunch of coffee shops that
still owed us money for the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We literally just dropped a pile of keys
on those coffee shops, just left it and
[SPEAKER_01]: said, we got to get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Pete Young calls me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, hey, if you're going to
Amsterdam, go to a place.
[SPEAKER_01]: They owe us this much and they owe us this
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a little shit list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, Dad, do you want to come to
Amsterdam with me?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be my muscle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go collect some money.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad's very much like me, a small little
white man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a social worker.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't have a harmful bone in his
body.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got all my meetings set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first morning is at the Bluebird with
Garrett.
[SPEAKER_01]: Garrett's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows that I had this, my tempo ball,
my greasy tempo ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was smoking tobacco, that with
tobacco and a nice coffee in the morning
[SPEAKER_01]: just made my day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way it was supposed to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take my old man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Garrett's there and he's got all the nice
behind the counter tempo ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's throwing them all out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad's just like, where am I?
[SPEAKER_01]: We start puffing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on joint three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see my old man in the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 9.30 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half a croissant in his hand passed out in
the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, hey, Pop, we got three more
meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, give me a taxi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going back to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Garrett looks at me and he's like,
your daddy's not Dutch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Garrett was a good man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was one of the first guys to come on to
Legends Seeds from Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Dutch passion, not Sensi, not serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the big six, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the first guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, we sold a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sold a lot of his seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a good man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really miss him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did he pass?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what I heard?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he just got out of the game.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was when the first downsizing was
happening in the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: He wasn't into it anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: He apparently made an offer to Simon and
Simon took it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like 2010, 2011 when they merged,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhere around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good almost nine years after I
last dealt with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good for him, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always knew what he was going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a really good guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: His stuff had a good reputation too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really did.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Warlock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone mentioned the Bitty Early.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was another one that he was famous
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know who around the same time was
Felix from Alceez?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been trying to find the Purparia
tichinensis for so many years in pure
[SPEAKER_03]: form.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have F gen of it maybe somewhere,
but yeah, it's hard to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a base purple that breeds true for
purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an obsession with purples.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always been on the list and his
stuff is so hard to get over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're an antho head.
[SPEAKER_01]: The special part of his stuff was it was
high-altitude bred.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was getting those yields up like 1,500
feet, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was some special shit and it wouldn't
mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could literally throw mold at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet if you threw through labs now,
it probably sat at about 14%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got you high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good day's smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was bountiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also know what I think it had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ryan, I think I had cedarine in it,
to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I know I can identify that
terpene, now I know that taste because
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had that taste before.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I had that taste was in the
Purparia tichinensis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, and then the Heaven.
[SPEAKER_01]: His Heaven was one of his best bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That total equatorial that yielded like a
punk was basically like a Durban crossed
[SPEAKER_01]: haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was spectacular.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never even heard of that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he sold that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Heaven, the Purparia tichinensis,
and he had a third one that he only ran
[SPEAKER_01]: two lots of from like 01 to 03.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to go back into my page.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have receipts for three that we bought
from them at one point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it herb beer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pardon me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it the herb beer?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't ring a bell, but brother,
it might be.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just stands for strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a super strawberry strain that he
would fuck with a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, his nursery was right downtown,
almost in Ligano.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like this little concrete compound,
and you had this greenhouse inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were banks all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the very OG original rebel from
Switzerland back in the 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: He broke all the rules, didn't give a
flying fuck, and when the cops would start
[SPEAKER_01]: pressing him, he'd just go run to the
hills for a couple of months, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: he'd get a button and come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, another guy, just another teacher
in this game.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never heard anybody talk about him,
and I've always wondered about Al Seed's,
[SPEAKER_03]: like who he was, how he ran his shit,
so that's pretty fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason is a total mountain man tichinesin.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just an old Italian goat up in the
mountains talking to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kipper, tell us about the SBOs,
the Seed Bank Originals.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that, brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seed Bank Originals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus, I guess 20 years has passed,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're allowed to talk about this shit now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, please do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started Legends, and obviously,
we were like the sixth seed company on the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world wide web at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty all new, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All we could do is go across to Amsterdam,
buy a bunch of seed, come back,
[SPEAKER_01]: and resell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I started getting to know the
Canadian growers, and one of my old
[SPEAKER_01]: partners knew Ed Rosenthal, and he had
gotten basically his hands on Neville's
[SPEAKER_01]: last selections in Cali before he went
back to the Oz, before he got busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were dubbed the Seed Bank Originals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had our hands on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like 25, 30 year old seeds,
and not taken care of perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just put it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was probably 35%, 40% germ rates,
but what we were looking for was building
[SPEAKER_01]: blocks to what all the cannabis is we know
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has to do with Skunkman.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to do with all those cats.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know who we're talking about,
like the big fab four, as it were.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys that are the only reasons the
three of us are talking to each other
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people thought, oh, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the founding father, the Mount
Rushmore of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fact, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know of every interaction I've ever had
with Dave.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that Ryan would like to forget a
few.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only because he's the most contiguous old
man who's always right, and God love him,
[SPEAKER_01]: for Christ sakes, because he usually is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to Rob, to Neville, to Howard Marks,
even, if you want to go into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: To Ben Drogger, for Christ sakes,
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long story short, we got those seeds
through a partnership, and we got a chance
[SPEAKER_01]: to actually sell them up on Legends.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a lot of folks, got a lot of
building blocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleo was one of my best hidden secrets on
that one, and the Ortega three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those were my favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had three Ortegas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Three?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we had the one, two, and three.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a hash plant cross, a kush cross,
and a skunk cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the original Ortega in Switzerland,
and that thing was just buttons of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was the purest hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the closer land race hash plants
I'd ever seen to this day, to be quite
[SPEAKER_01]: frank, and what I would know because it
wasn't bulked up, but the resin was the
[SPEAKER_01]: most intense resin I'd ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had those old damn shakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put that dry bud in the top,
and it had this silly screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just simply got your hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were camouflaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had one of those at the facility in
Switzerland, and everyone would always do
[SPEAKER_01]: it with the Ortega because it would just
puke it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had the huge fat heads under the
microscope, and dark and greasy as all I
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I know what myrcene smells and
effects are, the thing was covered in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beta-periophiline, myrcene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was peppery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like black licorice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just greasy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the ones you always had the
hashbacks with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have 15 hashbacks a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my experience with those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, just building blocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I always wanted to manage.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of people have been wanting
to hear that story for a long time,
[SPEAKER_03]: so thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Crybaby's in there looking stoked
as fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: He finally got to hear the Ortega story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's what I'll go into one deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we got to Switzerland, a friend of
ours brought over two clones from
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was the grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was the Ortega, the original Ortega
bomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we brought over to
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend of ours brought those over for
us, so that was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cuts in a suitcase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they made it and sold a lot of clones
over in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we started a lot of breeding
lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what was so special about Calliope for
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first time I experienced any
kind of what I know now to be limonene,
[SPEAKER_01]: limonene, turpinoline.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know it then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, I didn't have the knowledge or
understanding of the vocabulary or the
[SPEAKER_01]: COAs in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that I know now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was that I'm a turpinoline
junkie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if I could do lines of it all day,
I would, I swear to God.
Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do love the turpinoline.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it makes everything taste way
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Birds of a feather, my man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people hate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you love it, you can appreciate how
much it adds to flavor and the high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny because I find the selling to
this generation, they're all gasheads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Total gasheads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring me the gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck the tropicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck the exotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hear it all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just start feeling like an old man
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know people are going to kick me in my
head if I don't ask both of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the most traditionally smelling
like a skunk line that you have been
[SPEAKER_03]: around?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like traditionally smelling like a skunk
that's been run over a mile away.
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the most traditionally skunk lines
you've come across?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was called BC skunk back in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: That BC skunk one was?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like early nineties.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember hearing about as a name branded
thing before I knew that there was branded
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis or named cannabis varieties,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, everybody stopped growing it
because it was during the kick your door
[SPEAKER_06]: in period of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you'd lose it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where people would, you know, you could
have the cops going up in your house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody stopped growing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they've recently identified a
chemical.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like one MBT.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have to look it up because it's got a
name like this on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they've actually identified the
compound that's actually responsible for
[SPEAKER_06]: that smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: So once you know it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a thiol, ester?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's an aldehyde.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually not sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have to look it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that would make sense just from the
putridness of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that you just need a little bit
and it has a big effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the point is that once you know what
lip it is on the chromatograph,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's pretty easy to start looking up
plants that have higher amounts in it,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a chemistry nerd.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone's going to take a diverse set of
population and start looking for that
[SPEAKER_06]: blip, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That peak on the chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once you find it, then you just
start breeding it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll come up like that's what we need.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've done it with THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the lab reading you were talking
about in the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the expense of it is quite high to be
doing it, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to take it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen, once you've done it, you won't go
back to the other way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guarantee you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you'll cry and have to go back to the
other way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll do everything you can,
including selling your children,
[SPEAKER_06]: to find a way to pay for the test,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's so night and day difference
between doing it the old school way just
[SPEAKER_06]: on your nose.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had a lot of people be quite
resistant to the whole lab-led breeding
[SPEAKER_06]: thing or the science-led breeding thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the truth is, dude, it doesn't take
anything away from the way that we've
[SPEAKER_06]: always been doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just gives you another set of data to
look at and to refine your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I finally got access to the lab,
we would grow hundreds of plants from
[SPEAKER_06]: across.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would save a little mug for each of
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when I had the labs in front of
me, I'd go through them individual by
[SPEAKER_06]: individual, look at the lab report,
not even looking at the butt, just looking
[SPEAKER_06]: at the lab report and holding the butt
underneath my nose and rolling it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then going through them sequentially
to try to train my nose to like,
[SPEAKER_06]: what is... Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know that there's a slight difference
in the cell and the smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I see that on the graphs?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we make graphs and everything so
that... I find when you have lists of
[SPEAKER_06]: terpene names and terpene values as like
1.3%, whatever expresses the percent of
[SPEAKER_06]: the percentage, it's kind of meaningless,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you're kind of like always
scrolling through the list and trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: add it up in your head.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you take those numbers and you make a
graphical representation of them,
[SPEAKER_06]: we did graphical, like essentially peak
line bar graphs so that you could see the
[SPEAKER_06]: quantity.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we also made every terp its own color.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's smart.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in that way, it was a pain in the ass
at first, because you'd have to remember,
[SPEAKER_06]: oh yeah, pinyin is green, osmene is
orange, beta-caryophylline is blue.
[SPEAKER_06]: But once after a hundred lab samples,
you knew which was which.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you didn't even have to look down a
column and see how much beta-caryophylline
[SPEAKER_06]: is there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You would look at the graph immediately
and be like, boom, beta-caryophylline is
[SPEAKER_06]: the highest peak, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what that did is it kind of
reduced the scent picture into a graphical
[SPEAKER_06]: representation that your brain could
recognize on a moment of notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were being taught and you didn't know
you were being taught.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so visual.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Ryan got back from California and he
explained this all to me, I felt like
[SPEAKER_01]: literally I was the dumbest person in
cannabis beside him.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and Moran has such a beautiful
way of being able to describe things to
[SPEAKER_01]: people and bring it down to its lowest
common denominator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have full understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to bust that out because the way
you've explained it is really perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it was, you know, listen,
I got lucky working with Mark Lewis and
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt Geezy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're both top, top notch
chemists.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it was really like kind of spoiling
to not have to figure that whole component
[SPEAKER_06]: out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, these are the chemicals that
we want to be looking at and they would go
[SPEAKER_06]: and do all the work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then come back with these lab reports
that were just fucking like super
[SPEAKER_06]: informative.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, you could glance at two
graphs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody asked if it was a spider graph.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a spider graph for flavor,
but we essentially had a series of graphs
[SPEAKER_06]: that did, you know, you'd have,
you'd have a series of graphs in a,
[SPEAKER_06]: in a, all on different rows, but one
individual would be on a column going
[SPEAKER_06]: through all the graphs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so just by looking at these four
graphs, you can get an idea of which plant
[SPEAKER_06]: was, had the most.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh look, Steve Habba's here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plant the Habba.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's actually someone that's been doing
work with these same graphs that I'm just
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Habba for those of you that don't
follow him is, he was kind of behind the
[SPEAKER_06]: lemon crush that won the Emerald Cup a few
years ago, I think 2017.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very talented and educated plant
breeder in his own right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, like when you have the tools to
be able to like essentially visualize
[SPEAKER_06]: these things that we call smell,
you know, like for example, when we,
[SPEAKER_06]: when you smell something, you're not
smelling one thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're smelling an orchestra of compounds
all together at the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's kind of like listening to a
symphony or like a, like a piece of
[SPEAKER_06]: classical music.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't necessarily hear like the oboe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless, unless you really train your ear
and then you learn how to like pick out
[SPEAKER_06]: the oboe in that overall mix.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, it's, it's something that we
haven't done well, even amongst the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis breeding community, but I think
that we need to really do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a book in, if only a book that
David Watson showed that has called Le Nez
[SPEAKER_06]: Du Vang.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, it's, it means the nose of wine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a book that you open it up and
it's got like, I don't know, 20 or 30
[SPEAKER_06]: little vials that have all the different
scents that, you know, like smoke and
[SPEAKER_06]: leather and tobacco, like all the notes
that they use to describe, sorry,
[SPEAKER_06]: wine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I've always wanted to do one of
those, like a really complete one for
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would have all the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd have a bunch of, you know,
a bunch of like all these other volatiles
[SPEAKER_06]: that we're talking about, the aldehydes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the esters and files, whatever you can
get your hands on and you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: put a little booklet with it so that you
can really put this out because right now
[SPEAKER_06]: we have like, I mean, there's some people
that are kind of starting to figure it out
[SPEAKER_06]: just because like, for example,
Kip, like Kip's in a job where he has
[SPEAKER_06]: hundreds of growers contacting him all the
time, looking to sell their weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he needs a way to be able to separate,
segregate, like what's the good from the
[SPEAKER_06]: bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the tool that we have now as a lab
report, you know, show me the COA and it
[SPEAKER_06]: brings you the, you know, the certificate
of analysis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course it tells you how much
cannabinoids are in it because that's
[SPEAKER_06]: important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody on the rec market wants to know
what THC is in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But more importantly, it becomes about,
about scent, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, you have to have some kind of
lab measure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when you're sorting through like
hundreds of samples of weed that people
[SPEAKER_06]: are trying to sample and sell you and
you're seeing all the lab reports,
[SPEAKER_06]: you get, you can actually start,
it's like, oh, look, here's one that's
[SPEAKER_06]: piney and dominant.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the Miracene one dominant ones go into
another pile and the Terpidoline dominant
[SPEAKER_06]: ones go into another pile.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see, it's like, it's kind of
just like taking a shuffle pack of cards,
[SPEAKER_06]: like face up and then sorting them into
their suits, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when you start looking at them only
based on the chemistry, you realize that
[SPEAKER_06]: it's like, oh, there's just a bunch of
categories, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then everything falls into one of
those categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any idea how much Miracene,
Beta-Cariophylline, Limonene I see in a
[SPEAKER_01]: day?
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell do you think that is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 8 out of 10 COAs I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't even need to see the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some form of culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been digging into the rosin stash a
little bit lately and going through and
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm finding plants that when we separate
out the rosin, you can actually,
[SPEAKER_06]: I can tell that they have the same terpene
profile, but they have like different
[SPEAKER_06]: profiles of aldehydes or esters.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's like, you really get this idea
where you can actually start to,
[SPEAKER_06]: we can break cannabis apart into
cannabinoids, terpenes, aldehydes,
[SPEAKER_06]: esters.
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's maybe a thiol class,
then maybe that comes in there as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's really like in each of those
scent molecules, or not the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_06]: because they're not scented, but they're
important, is that it's really just us
[SPEAKER_06]: layering all these different combinations
of the individual suits in any chemical
[SPEAKER_06]: class, be it like THC or CBD in the
cannabinoid class or like Terpenoline or
[SPEAKER_06]: Miracene or whatever, you know,
in the terpene class.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, we're just literally,
we can only put it together so many ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's some of these chemicals that
like, if you put it on or you take it
[SPEAKER_06]: apart or you take this one chemical out,
it totally changes the scent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that, that like beta-cariophylline,
Miracene dominant class that is ever
[SPEAKER_06]: present on the market is like OG and
cookies and everything in that flavor
[SPEAKER_06]: class.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like, those aren't even the
chemicals that are responsible for that
[SPEAKER_06]: gassy scent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, when they fall in that
background, and you get that scent
[SPEAKER_06]: modifier, that's when you get like that
really funk to it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, orchestra, it's about the
orchestra.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I think that that's where it
becomes, you know, you crybaby was talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about perfumes earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, that's what like being a
perfumier is really about.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, you're learning how to put
together these different, it's like,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're being a chef, really.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, really.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a, it's a, it's a super kind of
deconstructive, simplifying approach,
[SPEAKER_06]: but like anybody that's really into this
shit, like I really suggest trying to do
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, try to find a way where you can get
yourself a bunch of lab profiles and the
[SPEAKER_06]: standards, like having, like I said,
either having all these different buds or
[SPEAKER_06]: even better this, the like limonene and
turpinoline and teaching yourself that
[SPEAKER_06]: palette is like, you, you can't put into
words how powerful it is because again,
[SPEAKER_06]: when we're like, look, when we're talking,
we're talking about, I'll show you one of
[SPEAKER_06]: our Canadian funky fifties, but like when
we're talking about like color,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, we can both look at this and
immediately understand what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we have a reference point where we
can both point to this and say,
[SPEAKER_06]: look, that is the fucking color that we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't do that with scent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because like, again, because it's an
orchestra of scent, we can't point to any
[SPEAKER_06]: one part and without each having a common
language agree that we're talking about
[SPEAKER_06]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why you hear people using these
words like cedary or earthy or floral or
[SPEAKER_06]: herbal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But really like that's not fucking
helpful.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, no, it isn't, you know, so,
and it's just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, you have to, you have to teach
yourself that skill.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for breeding with the labs,
the fact that you can, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: the traditional method, I mean,
we all agree is kind of like a shotgun
[SPEAKER_03]: mail method where you pick a mail based on
something, just something, and seeing how
[SPEAKER_03]: it breeds is completely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you know, it's actual terpene
profile and everything, you can actually
[SPEAKER_03]: see how he's breeding, which is so much
more important than, than just the shotgun
[SPEAKER_03]: method.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, it's a whole nother tool to
add to the toolkit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, you know, I've also like,
I've also learned, you know, like once I
[SPEAKER_06]: have that set of tools, I don't always
have to rely on the lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's like, you might make a cross
and it's like, I can recognize the
[SPEAKER_06]: profile.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just because I recognize what the
scent is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need to send that sample to a lab
unless I'm trying to quantify.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, you know, the terpene profile
is kind of like the quality, like what the
[SPEAKER_06]: type, you know, kind of like a,
really like a Mendelian type way,
[SPEAKER_06]: but really what you're also trying to do
is breed up the level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's where it's really important
to have the lab is like, because you
[SPEAKER_06]: can't, it's kind of hard to do that
without like, you know, if I handed you a
[SPEAKER_06]: 3% and a 4% terpene, but like almost
everybody in this chat room, including the
[SPEAKER_06]: people in the lab, I think would have a
hard time doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can chime in on that if you're not,
but it's just one of those things that's
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of hard to measure unless you have a
GC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chem one is one of those ones that tests
high, like four to 5% mercy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so much different than the other chem
dogs, the chem one, it's more of NL5
[SPEAKER_03]: haze-based, I think, but it carries really
high terpene content with the mercy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got all the fingerprints from those.
[SPEAKER_06]: I collected all that stuff off of Spyrock.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not 100% sure that that's where it
came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell us some Spyrock stories?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we have some Spyrock stories?
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to, but you'd have to see
some cool stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I went there the first time in
2011 and it was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's hard to imagine the context of what
it was like back then, but it was a
[SPEAKER_06]: totally different world, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember being so blown away.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the time, every property on
Spyrock, there's like 4,000 properties on
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like at the time, every property,
and I don't think I'm being like too
[SPEAKER_06]: hyperbolic and saying every property had
like 99 trees on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So people were pulling down like 500
pounds on a property.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a lot of weed coming out of
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know how much time you spent
up there, but they've got this incredible
[SPEAKER_06]: radio station called K-MUD, which is like,
oh, you got to check it out, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fucking really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's essentially red.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they call it Redwood Radio.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like Laytonville and all the way
up the corridor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of like an Arcada.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was blown away because I was a
foreigner, also keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was like, I was aware that this was
federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this one mountain is essentially
pumping out like, Jesus, dude,
[SPEAKER_06]: it must have been in the tonnage of flour.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody was sitting around during
harvest, listening to K-MUD radio,
[SPEAKER_06]: which was essentially like grower radio.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was community radio.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was paid for by the growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they were doing their fundraiser,
like NPR always does the fundraisers.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were doing their fundraiser for the
year during harvest because everybody sits
[SPEAKER_06]: around with their eyes in a chair and
scissors in their hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'd be playing all these weed
songs, reggae or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of esteemed songs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the DJ would come on and be like,
there's a grower up on Spiroc that is
[SPEAKER_06]: going to match any donation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're a new guy to the mountain,
it's your first year and you're trimming
[SPEAKER_06]: and you want to donate some money to K-MUD
radio, this grower J over on wherever is
[SPEAKER_06]: going to match the first five people's 100
bucks or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it was really cool because it was
like the pirate radio.
[SPEAKER_06]: The radio signal being broadcasted.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the really fucking cool thing was that
it was like, the breaking news was like,
[SPEAKER_06]: they got someone pulled over, over down on
whatever road or the helicopters were
[SPEAKER_06]: flying in this valley today.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were the eyes in the sky.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's legit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fucking cool, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I realized that, I was like,
dude, Mendo is fucking on a whole nother
[SPEAKER_06]: level of organization.
[SPEAKER_06]: And culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't get lost in the transition.
[SPEAKER_06]: These people cut out a fucking way of life
up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: The growers all banded together and built
a school on the mountain because they
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't want their kids going down to the
valley and saying, oh yeah, my daddy grows
[SPEAKER_06]: trees for a living or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's so punk talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teach your children well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that the same?
[SPEAKER_06]: And they did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every year, all the growers would save
some of their trunks or their branches and
[SPEAKER_06]: they'd be given to the school and the
school would learn how to make paper from
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like they do in Gilroy with
Garlic Town.
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole culture is around garlic,
but it's totally normal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was the thing that was so
impressive to me that it was like,
[SPEAKER_06]: fuck, this is so normalized.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even an illegal market or an illegal
district or whatever, the federal,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the district of the states.
[SPEAKER_06]: Face it.
[SPEAKER_06]: All that weed is going back to back east.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, sure, some of it gets sold in
dispensaries, but most of it can't now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Money's not there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all interstate or black market shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And still, it's a fucking huge culture,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's persistent, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't get that kind of, that doesn't
develop in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like those are like systems that develop
over decades, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, Mendo and Humboldt, Trinity,
like that whole zone is pretty special.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I got a lot of love for those
folks on Spyrock because they're just so
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking balls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Gene is a Spyrock boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's beautiful up there, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember at the top, there was this like
rock outcropping where there's like,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's these weird patterns that are cut
into the rock.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they think it's like, it was like a
native map that they had put up on the top
[SPEAKER_06]: of this mountain so that you could like,
you know, you can stand overlooking this
[SPEAKER_06]: valley and you can essentially see the
different watersheds and which tribes were
[SPEAKER_06]: living in which watershed, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that why it was called Spyrock?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for the kids, the kids look out area,
Spyrock, looking out for the cops.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard that.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the top of the mountain, there's a big,
like it looks kind of like a mohawk
[SPEAKER_06]: stepping up out of the top of the
mountain.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that that was the Spyrock.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know where the origin was.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's like people have been
living there for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's wild.
[SPEAKER_06]: We think of it like in European terms in
potgars, but it's like, there is people
[SPEAKER_06]: that were living up there for,
you know, eons.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything you could speak on in
the Tom Hill range or that you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about there or any of the work you
saw?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tom's a funny guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he's pretty brazen on the forums,
but he's, I don't really find him like
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: In real life until he gets like,
you know, a few beers in him and then he's
[SPEAKER_06]: like right up in your face.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a strongly opinionated person.
[SPEAKER_06]: First time I met him, he fucking lit me up
about writing something about single seed
[SPEAKER_06]: dissent in that Jorge book like years and
years and years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I don't think that that's
what I wrote.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he's like, he really gets into the
minutiae on the breeding stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: but he doesn't have a lot of space to be
doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, he's someone that I would love
to see get a field, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And put a leash on him so that he
couldn't, or one of those shock callers so
[SPEAKER_06]: that he couldn't leave the property.
[SPEAKER_06]: And get in trouble.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as he's got his little puppy,
it's only good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to keep him focused on the fucking
grow, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shiny objects.
[SPEAKER_06]: He could be doing some interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like he's like wasting his talents
up there, but yeah, I got nothing but love
[SPEAKER_06]: for him.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, how about some of your Watson stories
as far as breeding goes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything you can talk about with
that?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, listen, you know how it is with
David.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's such a private individual.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really want him to tell those stories
because that's how I learned them,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Begging to have him tell them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's going to be a thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a challenge to get it
done.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's important because if it did come
that Dave were to pass, then I would start
[SPEAKER_06]: sharing some of these stories because
there's knowledge there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just things that he taught me about.
[SPEAKER_06]: About like collecting pollen or like,
you know, he did like these epic epic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you some interesting stories one
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dave found a way years and years and years
ago to work within the system.
[SPEAKER_06]: Within the existing hemp world,
but get work done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like get work on drug cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether it was like producing tons of seed
or like, you know, like he really figured
[SPEAKER_06]: out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ways to operate in both sides legally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he is like he was compliant,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: He was following the terms of his license
or whatever it was doing and.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, like everybody,
you know, everybody kind of knows about
[SPEAKER_06]: Dave seed collection.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's there's also a pollen
collection, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a pollen collection that's bigger
than most people seed collection like it's
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I just when you start
thinking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for example, did every time you
throw pollen, are you collecting pollen?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always had a hard time storing it,
and then when I go back to use it,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just not viable and I waste a whole
round on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so he's like he's figured that all
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess he's got like jars of pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you can walk into a room,
crack a jar out of the freezer and toss it
[SPEAKER_06]: in front of a fan.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, we're talking like 15,
20 year old pollen and getting full seed,
[SPEAKER_06]: full seed set.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, that's one of the things I'm
going to be doing as I as I move forward
[SPEAKER_06]: on the next round of really, really
serious breeding is setting up like pollen
[SPEAKER_06]: collection so that every time you drop in
pollen, you you have satchels of that
[SPEAKER_06]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are whatever you can go back to
because it's just it's such a little
[SPEAKER_06]: amount of work to do that versus having to
go through the process of initiate a plant
[SPEAKER_06]: and get more pollen from that genotype
again.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like you may as well do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was saying that on one of our little
feature cannabis podcast the other day,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's like, you know, I'm all about
like.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude from Rebel Grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm forgetting his real name right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jay, but Rebel Grown, I think his name is
Jay, but he's like, you know, he was
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about like for example,
when you're, you know, you got it,
[SPEAKER_06]: you got a parent or say you're making an
S1.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've made a cross and then you do a
selection.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you've now you got your your F1
seed that you're growing through the cross
[SPEAKER_06]: that you made.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you find a plant that you're you want
to sell in that generation, like you may
[SPEAKER_06]: as well sell that plant, but also
pollinate it to both of the parental
[SPEAKER_06]: generation at the same time, because you
got the pollen flying anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: All you're doing is sticking a clone in
there to collect, even if you get 100
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds or a couple hundred seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's enough for like a breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a commercial release,
but it's like, you know, you've got that
[SPEAKER_06]: in the bank or in the vault.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just little things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try to be efficient.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and that's like all that most of
this stuff came from Dave.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily the selfing things,
but like just opening my eyes up to like
[SPEAKER_06]: different ways of doing it and not getting
kind of stuck in the same thought process
[SPEAKER_06]: that we all get stuck in through passing
info around on forums or Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We get stuck in a rut.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why it's so cool when you get
all these new people coming on,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, into the community from outside,
you know, like the cinch angel guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you see him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's posting some really great information
online.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, that's the real beauty of
legalization is that we now are not like
[SPEAKER_06]: dirty untouchables.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We get to associate with all the rest of
the people in society.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And learn and benefit from them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm ranting.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, but that's that Paul and tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really, I had such a hard time
storing pollen in so many crops trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: use stored pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I go through the method of
using a pollen screen, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: to make sure all the male parts are out,
let it dry, put it inside of an airtight
[SPEAKER_03]: container that's dark, you know,
in the fridge or freezer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just fucking never works.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the drying it properly is a big,
big thing to make.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that's drying it properly is a big
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then making sure that it's frozen and
stays frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he's got a dedicated freezer.
Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: And listen, some of these things,
like they become like possible when you
[SPEAKER_06]: have scale, like you can't really do some
of the shit on on like bedroom scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can play around.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's like, it's really hard to really
do it, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's like the reason for sharing
that is that I want you to take it like I
[SPEAKER_06]: want everybody to take that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, those are the those are the
things that Dave has taught me that I
[SPEAKER_06]: would love for him to share with the rest
of the community.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, you know, I think part of the
reason is that we have all these people
[SPEAKER_06]: that have just trashed him online for
years and years because, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: partly because they were jealous.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like, you know, Kip was talking
about Ariane before.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like one of the reasons people don't
like Ariane is because he's successful and
[SPEAKER_06]: he's fucking really good at what he does
and he makes a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are jealous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are jealous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the same thing happened with Dave.
[SPEAKER_06]: He got the licenses to work in Holland
when the Dutch dudes that lived there
[SPEAKER_06]: couldn't figure out how to get the
licenses.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he figured out which, you know,
which path to take to get the trophy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and they hated him for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's where all the stories
started coming from.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was based in Chelsea.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I tell you, dude, like after knowing
David and learning from him for so long,
[SPEAKER_06]: he's the real fucking deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and anybody that says otherwise,
they just don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like when people I see people start
barking shit about like Watson being a
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking DEA agent or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, I'm just like, oh, well,
this guy just doesn't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like he's self-identity.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's identifying himself as someone that
doesn't get it because like Dave's the
[SPEAKER_06]: real deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That stuff's been passed around for so
long.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was involved in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I thought he was a DEA agent
because of what Neville told me directly,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it and it takes a long time
for stuff like that to die out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with him not interacting much and not
I mean, he shouldn't have to defend
[SPEAKER_03]: himself if it's not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with him, there's not a lot of input
from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people just run with it and it becomes
the Lord.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know how these things are.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, you know, you have a negative
kind of something happens in your life and
[SPEAKER_06]: it's like you got to deal with it like
other people talking about it all the time
[SPEAKER_06]: and you deal with it and it goes away.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's like some of those things,
it's like they just never go away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like people just keep bringing it up no
matter what.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like when truthfully, like and I will
say this, like believing in 100%,
[SPEAKER_06]: there is nobody live on the fucking planet
that has done more for cannabis than David
[SPEAKER_06]: Watson.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that is the fucking I would agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: Without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Including like, you know, founding and
funding the International Health
[SPEAKER_06]: Association.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he created a hub in that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Process and brought all the individual
researchers in the world gave them all a
[SPEAKER_06]: central hub place to call home.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that created a sense of community for
the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the whole industry, like the global
cannabis industry at a time when the DEA
[SPEAKER_06]: were fucking knocking countries off,
left, right and center.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I would love to have David.
[SPEAKER_06]: Answer all these questions and just sit
there and be like, I wouldn't even want to
[SPEAKER_06]: be, I just want to draw the information
out of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know a lot of the stories now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, I know what questions to ask
to get them to talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he's done some like just absolutely
incredible things with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if he doesn't share those stories
while he's around, there has to be a movie
[SPEAKER_06]: made to document it for history because
it's like the level of epicness.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just from what I know for a fact is
it would be a crazy fucking movie.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One dinner's worth of conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He easily do a movie with Andre,
but dinner with Dave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Easy peasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get lost down so many roads of his
incredible intellect and adventure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And balls to do what he did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Balls.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big balls.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because he didn't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he firmly believed that it was the
right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he told me a story about being in
Morocco and getting like sickness and,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, in Morocco they don't have
toilets.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like a hole on the floor kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he's like having some virus,
some bacteria just like go through his
[SPEAKER_06]: system and decimate him.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he started smoking hash on the,
while he was over the hole, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it immediately realized that cannabis
had medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, it can work for him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is back before anybody had really
considered like the cannabis was
[SPEAKER_06]: medicinal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we're talking like 60s here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just made it his life's work to like
take that as far as he could.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, you know, the Horta Farm
stories and the GW and all the stuff that
[SPEAKER_06]: people have said.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can just distill that down to like
the few truths that exist in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dave had the fucking first medical
marijuana company in the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there was no one else doing that back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's where a lot of the
suspicion came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that he was just, he pulled it
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And jealousy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like resentment that he figured out
when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, he, you know, yeah,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got nothing but good things to say about
David.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, in many ways he's kind of a father
figure.
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, you know, Kip and these dudes had
met him well before I had Marcus
[SPEAKER_06]: Richardson.
[SPEAKER_06]: They knew him before.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dave and I used to just speak online.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when I met him, he was really rude to
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the first time I met him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he essentially turned his back to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's generally how David meets people,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure he has a punch for me,
but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd take a punch to meet him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I had the key to the secret club of
Dave, of David's.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's essentially like, if you have the
five star, the six star hash or like an
[SPEAKER_06]: incredible, you know, little jar of rosin
or something like that, like something
[SPEAKER_06]: that's truly fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dave will sit down and chat with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he's so passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That it's like, if you have, if you have
the goods, then he has to give you respect
[SPEAKER_06]: because you don't just end up with a jar
like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a truly top, top, top, top,
top shelf stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you have to be an artist or have at
least have an appreciation for making and
[SPEAKER_06]: finding the best.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you have that, then you're Dave's
kindred soulmate, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's his only goal in life is to
find the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a little tag onto that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first met Dave, he was walking
through our facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over in Europe and a very intimidating
figure.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a big guy, big taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, as you go through the
facility, he just kept taking these wooden
[SPEAKER_01]: matches and laying them and hitting this
bubble that he had on this tiny little
[SPEAKER_01]: pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they got the match.
[SPEAKER_01]: You literally like a treasure trail.
[SPEAKER_01]: You follow where Dave has been through all
the matches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And throughout the facility, like through
doors, around corners, come back around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like some kind of, you know,
Denny's treasure map for kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is he a big hashster as opposed to a
flower smoker?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he more into hash or?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen him smoke flowers.
Never.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good little insight into his
brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a pure resin farmer.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has this thing that he says,
I'll tell you one story.
[SPEAKER_06]: He tells me that he's, I've heard him say
a few times when he was in Afghanistan,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're talking like late sixties.
[SPEAKER_06]: He and his wife were sitting around with a
bunch of old men, the babas in the
[SPEAKER_06]: village, and they were smoking bubbly
bubbly's of the finest hash they had.
[SPEAKER_06]: And David was over there collecting seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he was trying to find stuff to bring
back.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he asked this old Afghanistan dude
for some cannabis so that he could get
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't say so I can get the seeds,
but he's like, do you have the flowers?
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said, like, like every,
everybody stopped talking and it was just
[SPEAKER_06]: like dead silence.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the men said to me,
he said, the man looked at him like he was
[SPEAKER_06]: a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he, and he said, hashish is for men.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis flower is for women and slaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking like this is old school,
you know, like Afghan culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Dave explained to him, no,
I want, I want the flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can get the seeds and take it back to
California and grow plants to make my own
[SPEAKER_06]: hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was like, that was it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was acceptable.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Dave was, I would love to know if you,
if, you know, when was the first time he
[SPEAKER_03]: was encountering Afghanis, was he one of
the first people importing the seeds of
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghanis to the U S in the late sixties?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he did, he's always kind of gone
through Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, even when they were in,
um, at Horta farm, like he was always
[SPEAKER_06]: screening shit loads of Afghani seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause people were always coming back from
there with different lots, but he said
[SPEAKER_06]: generally it was shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was not what you wanted.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to remember Dave, Dave got pretty
spoiled early on with like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: like he's neighbors with the Hayes
brothers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he had like, I think it's hard for
people of our age to understand that there
[SPEAKER_06]: was a time that was pre like Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people our age don't know that it,
came in the late seventies or eighties.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when it gained popularity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and so when it did come, I mean,
Rob, I think it was Rob wrote,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, an article on it for high times,
but it was the, you know, they high times
[SPEAKER_06]: had like a ban the bud issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, we need to ban Indica because
it's like fucking up our shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a movement in the community.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, cross Nate Indica and
everything because it's ruining our nice
[SPEAKER_06]: highs from the Colombians and the
Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So brilliant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So ahead of its time, really.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like now with cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people want to ban cookies from,
from genetics because everything's
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be the first person to sign up to the
application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm part of the problem though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I use it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what the fuck do I know?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is super gas too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm like, you know, I'm also guilty,
but I really do try to push the different
[SPEAKER_06]: terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause there's just some stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we came across this one thing that
was like a piney, like it had almost no
[SPEAKER_06]: other turps, but it was like a lot of
piney and a lot of limonene and dude,
[SPEAKER_06]: this shit was zippy, zippy, zippy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like near and focused and just high
energy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not talking about, you're not
talking about last summer.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I first came up to PR, I had a bag of
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if he tried anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was calling it the Lyman pine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, it's in that, it's just in that
very like equatorial family side of
[SPEAKER_06]: things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't yield where shit, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was a terrible plant to grow,
but it was lovely effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the rosin from it was like,
you know, took some down to Marcus and we
[SPEAKER_06]: pressed up or a couple ounces of it and it
was fire as fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, you'd want to be growing
that stuff in large cheap greenhouses
[SPEAKER_06]: outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because indoors, it just didn't make sense
for the real estate, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those things are big and burly and not a
lot of yield on some of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And somebody was asking about the Guerrero
line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was one of those plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd been playing with those seeds for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody sent us a bunch of old stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Legends used to actually put people would
be like, Oh, I have these seeds I want you
[SPEAKER_06]: to get in your hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd just say, send them legends.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And anyway, we, we found these,
these, this old Mexican screen through a
[SPEAKER_06]: bunch of them and they were gangly and
like just unruly as hell.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we were making the seeds for the
blueberry stuff, I just thought I was
[SPEAKER_06]: like, let's get one of those in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, I think one plant must be
yielded.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was, you know, it grew huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's probably in the like five to
10,000 seeds from that one plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the, the way they came together with
the blueberry, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: the blueberry kind of has that phenotype.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the two phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like the kind of more compact
round classic bud, but it also does like
[SPEAKER_06]: those kind of knuckly buds or like kind of
like little fox tails.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: When that got into the Mexican,
that made some crazy expressions,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the, just the flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Flowers that were like long sets of
bracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yellow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember what the, I remember what the
cross looked like in pictures.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminded me of the picture of lamb's
bread and Jason King's Canna Bible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real long, super long nothing fox tails.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, you know, that's still a fun
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really want to dig into that line,
but it kind of like, I'm kind of hoping
[SPEAKER_06]: that someone I'm like in the Caribbean
says, Hey, come and plant like,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, five acres down here for
selections.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause that's where you'd want to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's too, it's too hard to do
indoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in Canada, unless you are tarping that
stuff, you're not going to get that ever
[SPEAKER_06]: to flat like to finish flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the fun things that happen with
like legalization happening all over the
[SPEAKER_06]: world is we can legally move germplasm to
these new districts and set up a fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: screening station.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a bunch of stuff that I would love
to run, but, and that people have asked me
[SPEAKER_03]: if I'm going to work, but the realistic
part of it is I'm never going to see the
[SPEAKER_03]: ultimate expression of it, unless it's
running a proper place to even see what
[SPEAKER_03]: you can select.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm really hoping that this latest
project that I'm working on is going to
[SPEAKER_06]: afford, you know, it's, we're going to get
some space to, to do some cool stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: some cool work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I was saying to Kipper Lawrence
tonight, like I don't want to make it
[SPEAKER_06]: about the Ryan show, you know,
if we've got a chance to do it,
we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: To like really explore, dude, all of my
friends that have interesting seeds,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, are going to be welcome to come
and, you know, be part of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, that looks like, is it going to
be Canada?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's international, but there's going to
be a location in Canada.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the idea is to kind of have nursery
services to, to the new districts that are
[SPEAKER_06]: opening up all over the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the idea is to find a, like a
royalty model that is, that works for
[SPEAKER_06]: breeders so that they want to be part of
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they can opt into whatever degree of
participation they want to or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll essentially offer nursery
services so that it'll help people get
[SPEAKER_06]: into these markets globally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it was one of the things that was
really fucked up about Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's needed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been, it's been a real problem as the
industry grows is that there was no
[SPEAKER_06]: central place that had a bunch of
different good varieties that you could
[SPEAKER_06]: use.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or work with, you know, I mean,
dude, there's hundreds of excellent
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivars, like across the globe.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But essentially like people are like
trying to start these like multi-billion
[SPEAKER_06]: dollar companies with like three seeds
they bought off the internet from KIPP.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy in a way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of these massive, massive big like
pubco's where we're talking like the top
[SPEAKER_06]: three players, when they started their
bank, their bank, they did the same thing
[SPEAKER_06]: that all the beginners do is they went and
got like a hundred different types of
[SPEAKER_06]: named varieties, but they got a three pack
of each.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, dude, you'd be better off
getting three packs than a hundred of
[SPEAKER_06]: each.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because then you can actually do a real
selection.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, it's like that total lack of
understanding of cannabis to the point of
[SPEAKER_06]: like, you think that you can grow three
things with a name on it and they're all
[SPEAKER_06]: going to come up looking the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's fucking delusional.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's highly delusional.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, it's like everyone
runs the one side of the boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then everyone runs the other side of the
boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they go to the back side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mack wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, I mean, it just, it just keeps,
you know, the problem is keeping it in
[SPEAKER_01]: vogue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you've got to make an iconic
cultivar to get maybe two year run out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the way the market is right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you're at 10 months,
you're out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's just the reality of
unfortunately what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how, so how does that play with what,
you know, Brian's talking about and
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics and, and how do you, because
nurseries spend all this time,
[SPEAKER_01]: the breeders spend all this time
perfecting these beautiful cultivars for
[SPEAKER_01]: specific morphological grows in specific
paradigms of growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have all this work on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get literally healthy with the feed
at every bloody day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's a plug and play, like a crop,
a point setup, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then all for it to be at a favor in 10
months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me and CSI were talking about this the
other day and we're both believers in
[SPEAKER_03]: testing, like running your own shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know what your own shit is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see it in front of your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know how that male breeds,
et cetera, but at the rate the market's
[SPEAKER_03]: going, it's, it's almost getting to the
point of where testing will flush yourself
[SPEAKER_03]: out of the market as odd as that sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, honestly, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was just going to say what I've
found effective in the industry in a
[SPEAKER_01]: short, in a short snapshot we've seen is
guys who roll, you know, sorry,
[SPEAKER_01]: companies that roll four bars,
roll them, just roll them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can get like three or four,
you might pull a year off a single bar,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're rolling four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it buys you extra time and it keeps you
relevant and it keeps you fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it keeps people's interest in you
because like fly, like they forget,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like gnats, consumers,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's new?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's hot?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's new?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's hot?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's new?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's hot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Brand loyalty?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no brand loyalty.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no cultivar loyalty.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no flavor profile loyalty.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no loyalty.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not a thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: The funny thing is saying that,
I mean, I agree what you're saying to a
[SPEAKER_06]: degree, but like in the States,
we've seen this thing where there actually
[SPEAKER_06]: is brand loyalty or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loyalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they can market it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can make it a culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do that up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just making same labeled fucking
dopes all selling the same 12 different
[SPEAKER_01]: versions of cookie and cush, you know,
like, yay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's kind of what I'm trying to
get to that, to like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: the comment earlier about it all being
booth.
[SPEAKER_06]: To a degree, it's true because all these
companies that came out hot and horny at
[SPEAKER_06]: the beginning with all the money,
they were all public companies and they
[SPEAKER_06]: were all talking flags.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were all talking cash and million
square foot greenhouses and blah,
[SPEAKER_06]: blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we've seen over the last three years,
they're all fucking suffering.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Canopy is just they're bleeding
billions of dollars and their weed sucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, like I said, like what it
should have been from the start is just
[SPEAKER_06]: transitioning all the illegal growers over
and letting them keep running their
[SPEAKER_06]: business rather than trying to displace
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And no one would have made any money then,
Ryan.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would never be legalized that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only money made is off of stock plays.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they haven't actually made any money
selling weed, which is crazy when you
[SPEAKER_06]: think about how many families and
mortgages were supported and paid for
[SPEAKER_06]: across the United States, North America
and Canada as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I mean, that money went around not
only to the growers, but to their
[SPEAKER_06]: communities.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like banks.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like people were getting rich off
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: People were paying the bills.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, I see that the you know,
I think we're going to be going through
[SPEAKER_06]: some growing pains here that you guys
definitely are not going to experience
[SPEAKER_06]: down in the States because you don't have
that federal like not only do they
[SPEAKER_06]: federalize the the production laws and
everything, but the distribution is all
[SPEAKER_06]: provincial.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's all run by state like boards.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And and like Kit was saying, the way that
you have to sell to those boards,
[SPEAKER_06]: like for example, you know, if you go into
a wine store in California, it's like you
[SPEAKER_06]: can get pinot from a hundred different
producers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try finding like like a platinum cookies
from or what's give me a popular one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't put a Mac 10.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the LDBs, the Liquor
Distribution Boards.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, no, we already have a
wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to buy that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what happens is people have to rename
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that that's part of what's
changing.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's creating this like like Kit was
saying, it's this this unattainable or you
[SPEAKER_06]: were saying as well with Caleb.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's this unattainable drive for
the new new that it's like we're going so
[SPEAKER_06]: fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like you don't even have time to
appreciate what you made.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like you're making a new NFT and
selling it again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's not the way cannabis very
topical, very topical, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it's it's backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's very regressive for breeding
period.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not doable.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like it's yeah, it's literally like,
you know, we're using the platform right
[SPEAKER_06]: now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Instagram immediacy of needing
something new.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's how the most recent generation
has kind of learned about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, we got a lot of work to do
to redistribute the knowledge and get all
[SPEAKER_06]: these old varieties back in not only to
the hands of the consumers, but also teach
[SPEAKER_06]: these like liquor distribution boards.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, you know, you you can't come in
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen, they you know what it's like
you're running a you're doing
[SPEAKER_06]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to deal with five suppliers and
sell to a thousand customers.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't deal with like five hundred
suppliers and sell to a thousand
[SPEAKER_06]: customers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's a lot more work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're seeing more and more and we said
it since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big Pupco cannabis, like public market
company cannabis, that ain't the fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: future.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it becomes like this like this
dangling carrot where it's like they're
[SPEAKER_06]: it's more they're more interested in the
stock price than the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the customer doesn't give a fuck about
the stock price.
[SPEAKER_06]: The customer gives a shit about the weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're not giving the customer what
they want, what they want, why would
[SPEAKER_06]: anybody buy from you?
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're seeing like that play out year
after year now where where we can track
[SPEAKER_06]: their sales in the legal market.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see, it's just like it's going down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody's buying the drinks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody's buying the gummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason they're doing this and it's
very clear and very simple is that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: revenue driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not profit driven.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what it needs to be like.
[SPEAKER_01]: People need to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they sell for losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they sell and undercut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody else that's trying to make a
decent living and a decent wage,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, on a family business,
because they don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can run losses for look.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ray, look at Canopy, look at Aurora.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they all ran like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's capital.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They run at a loss until they until they
run their their competitors out of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they operate and take over the
market, drive everything up and jack the
[SPEAKER_01]: prices up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen, that would work.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would work in a whole bunch of other
crops where the consumer wasn't intimate
[SPEAKER_06]: with quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: The consumer demands quality in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you're not going to smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is what I'm used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Ryan, honestly, though, I mean,
like 65 percent of all cannabis buyers dry
[SPEAKER_01]: by dry cannabis here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what and what portion are they buying
it in?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're buying it in the cheapest possible
way for the highest possible with no
[SPEAKER_01]: differentiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to spend over twenty five
bucks an eighth generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just they just want their cheap
to open.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to get in, get out of the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is what the these are what
the metric they're telling us like monthly
[SPEAKER_01]: when we get all these numbers going to
come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just so disheartening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's because we can't market
our our products properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't talk to the vendors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest guys in the world in the
industry is producers and but tenders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's just horrific.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the lack of education.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like they're not telling
stories, especially making 16 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not here to tell stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they just want to like punch their
clock and get the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's on us as an industry to have to be
able to tell these stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like guerrilla warfare ways like
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know what to say at this
point in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I got to tell you, like,
you know, there's tons of companies that
[SPEAKER_01]: are pressing and pushing the boundaries of
what's allowable, you know, marketing and
[SPEAKER_01]: labeling and in a voice here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so understaffed, to be quite
frank, like they're not they're not really
[SPEAKER_01]: doing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, look at an LP that was
growing illegal dope in illegal rooms and
[SPEAKER_01]: they still have a license and they got
busted cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, you can bust me for for
putting my font two sizes too big on a
[SPEAKER_01]: label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, give me a break.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways,
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think that I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have to and I've been saying
this for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to figure out a way to make people
want to educate themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's so fucking hard to do when it
comes to weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hard because a lot of people just want
to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a culture, we're preaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always want everyone to be as happy as
we are with what we found in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people just don't have that
relationship and we can't push that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet there's still a consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and we have to there's also that and
that's a large part of the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer base.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have the attachment we all did
with the legalization, the hidden shame,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, you know, the meeting and the parking
lots, all that crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know what dealer is for great
sakes, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't dispense these.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know what a dealer is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is not the generation that our
generation understands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a new consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And new consumers want different flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want the cannabis delivered to
them differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want it in different skews.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want to be able to go online and
order it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't want any personal
interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to be able to tell a story
digitally and find a campaign that touches
[SPEAKER_01]: these kinds of consumers that aren't us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause all we do guys is go into a hallway
generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know that, you know, so again,
open minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I turned 50 this year and man,
like my, my mind is, I know less and less
[SPEAKER_01]: each day in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if there's just so much populating
this industry all day, that it's so tough
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep a handle on a lot of it to be
quite frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it keeps you, it keeps you interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm learning the seed industry every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always think I have it figured out and
then something comes along to make me
[SPEAKER_03]: realize how much I don't have it figured
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I watched a lot of these young bucks
figure it out just instantly around me.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making it happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have an app for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a program for it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're more dialed into what's going on
and how it operates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just turned 40 like yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, you know, I'm starting to feel a
little myself and all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, we got over an hour and a half
in and God, I could keep going and going
[SPEAKER_03]: and going and going and bothering you all
night.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you guys ever want to come back and
do this anytime, I know everybody watching
[SPEAKER_03]: enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been watching the comments and it's,
it's been very fruitful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really appreciate you guys coming
back to do this for the reunion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really stoked with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're anybody watching right now
hasn't watched it, feel free to go to
[SPEAKER_03]: Breeder Syndicate and we have Chimera and
Red right here with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was who is in season two,
episode one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This, this episode will be available via
Patreon after this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, join the Patreon for Breeder
Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully we can have these fine
gentlemen back again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really appreciate both of your time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are both amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an honor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks so much, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, yeah, it's been a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks again, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we've got a lot to learn from each
other.
[SPEAKER_06]: And very, very cool to see everybody in
the chat too.
[SPEAKER_06]: All these old names I haven't seen in so
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you, fellas, for coming along.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy birthday.
Cheers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers.
Cheers.
