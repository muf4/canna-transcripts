[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everyone, welcome to the breeder
syndicate right seeds germination tutorial
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured I'd just start from scratch But
the first thing I don't can't really show
[SPEAKER_00]: you because there's no sink here Wash your
hands wash them thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll wash them with soap Get up in there
hot water super important kill all the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria a lot of the germination process
is defeated by bacteria So yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we'll start with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some fresh paper towels brand new
we have a clean surface for our For our
[SPEAKER_00]: wet paper towel to sit on in between
before it goes in bags also, I'm gonna do
[SPEAKER_00]: a little advanced Tutorial while we're
doing this we have some old scissors here
[SPEAKER_00]: but one of the first things we want to do
with our scissors as well as everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else involved you want to clean those and
I'm using some Lysol wipes on these just
[SPEAKER_00]: cuz because I've used these for trimming
and all kinds of crazy shit, but Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: these scissors are nice great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're small if you'll notice they're
very small in my hands you can get these
[SPEAKER_00]: on Amazon pretty cheap and They're sharp
and they're precise when you're when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing advanced seed cracking you
want to use sharp precise Scissors that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can control with your hands and that
you can feel stuff through because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna feel that seed crack and you want to
stop the second year so First off what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna do is get our distilled water
so I've Filled this up a speaker up with
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 milliliters distilled water You know a
lot of people like to wet their paper
[SPEAKER_00]: towels in distilled water that's fine But
what also helps a lot is hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been scientific studies done on
this I watched one recently the other day
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube where I can't remember if it
was Utah University or somewhere like that
[SPEAKER_00]: did a study on Cannabis and hemp seed
germination rates with hydrogen peroxide
[SPEAKER_00]: and hydrogen peroxide did it Increase the
rates so I um Yeah, I always Tell people
[SPEAKER_00]: to use hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an old standby for years and it
keeps the amount of decamp decontamination
[SPEAKER_00]: down as best as you can that's important
Okay, so there's a brand new hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally I do like a 1% solution so 5
Milliliters to 500 but I'm just gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: eyeball it There we go should be enough
should be
[SPEAKER_00]: Next step You get your seeds right here we
have some ice cream bananas, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: banana og blue bonnet You want to open up
the package?
[SPEAKER_00]: So open it up Everything got a good Lysol
wipe down before this All right,
[SPEAKER_00]: so comes seal package one of our shells,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to take your paper towels?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only need one because we're only doing
one strange day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one section of paper towel You want to
make sure that this is all nice and mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: up Homogeneous as best you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's no magnetic stir under it,
but for our purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be fine You take your paper towel
and you fold it And you gently dip it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the water hydrogen peroxide mixture and
then Very importantly is the moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: content that you want to use you want to
wring out the water Pretty good You want
[SPEAKER_00]: it to where there's enough moisture?
[SPEAKER_00]: To the to the embryo wanting to hunt its
way out of this of the shell But you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want so much moisture that it's
waterlogged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see No drippage.
[SPEAKER_00]: No nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wet not Sopping wet and then you'll
take your seed pack Hopefully you'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing more than 10 to 13 but for this like
I said for our purposes works well So you
[SPEAKER_00]: put down your seeds how many seeds are in
this five and twelve seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I was going to show the advanced
cracking tutorial so let's say you get
[SPEAKER_00]: some really really nice healthy thick
shelled Afghani type seeds, so I'll pick
[SPEAKER_00]: the biggest shell we got here thickest
shell now Sometimes some people may think
[SPEAKER_00]: that the seed isn't germinating But what's
happening is that water isn't getting into
[SPEAKER_00]: its shell, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen people throw away so many
good seeds thinking that they weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: germinating They weren't viable but the
problem was the shell was just too thick
[SPEAKER_00]: to let water in in these extreme cases and
It really is a case-by-case basis on
[SPEAKER_00]: whether I do this or not Sometimes I'll do
this with seeds that don't pop after you
[SPEAKER_00]: know three days of being in the in the wet
paper towel I'll tend to take them out
[SPEAKER_00]: hand crack all the ones that didn't just
in case that's the issue I don't normally
[SPEAKER_00]: start off by hand cracking anything,
but for this purpose so you can see how
[SPEAKER_00]: it's done I wanted to show you so we take
it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a seam along the top I know this
is not going to be perfect, but we have
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a seam along the top of the seed
We gently rest the seed so it sits in
[SPEAKER_00]: there like like that long ways and you
want to gently apply pressure But all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way at the very very back as far back as
you can go inside The thing and when you
[SPEAKER_00]: start playing pressure the second you feel
and hear the crack, you're good Hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: you are able to hear that and we hand
crack that one So we just then toss it
[SPEAKER_00]: back with the rest of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We close it up close up shop Get a brand
new ziplock baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use the court freezer baggies
because the thicker plastic heavier mill
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever I put it in the baggie We I
always take out most of the air for
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever reason just so it doesn't move
around We label the baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I scream bananas I Scream
[SPEAKER_00]: Banananas I scream bananananas and the
last thing And I'm not gonna show you here
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I would do is I take painters
tape or some kind of tape and I put it on
[SPEAKER_00]: the back side of Like a cabinet or
something, you know on the back side and
[SPEAKER_00]: tape it on there We don't want it getting
a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want it to be in the dark and we want
it in a cool place We don't want it super
[SPEAKER_00]: hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want it cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just mostly dark, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some temperatures might be too cold for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check your check your temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep it right around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know 75 degrees ish It's about
where I keep it Yeah, so the reason that
[SPEAKER_00]: we tape it up on the back side too is so
gravity as these seeds pop gravity will
[SPEAKER_00]: start pulling the tap roots downwards and
I don't know if you've ever tried like
[SPEAKER_00]: popping seeds throwing them in a drawer
like setting them in there and being Cool
[SPEAKER_00]: with it to pop they curlicue and they're
very hard to plant in whatever medium
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna plant them in So that's why
we suspend them So gravity brings them
[SPEAKER_00]: downwards at least and so they're all in a
nice pattern for for planting In your
[SPEAKER_00]: medium, I usually plant them into cocoa
Another little trick that I do I let the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds stay in here until they have pushed
off their seed shell So they tend to be
[SPEAKER_00]: long seedlings with good tap roots and the
reason for that is After planting if any
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of bacterial problem happens in
whatever your medium is it'll be attacking
[SPEAKER_00]: that that fresh root system and if it has
You know true leaves past the cotyledons
[SPEAKER_00]: if it has true leaves, then it can still
intake water nutrients do anything it
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to do While the while the roots try
to reestablish and survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, those are my tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you all enjoyed it again Five mils
to 500 milliliters distilled water to I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry hydrogen peroxide to distilled water
keep everything clean clean is the key
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping it clean is the freaking key and I
wish if there's anything I can impress on
[SPEAKER_00]: you with this It would be that clean is
key Anyway, thank you for checking
