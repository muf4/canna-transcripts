[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so when we're starting to grow,
one of the things that comes up pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly is propagation or just getting
some clones basically of plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you guys the way that I
like to clone today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying this is the end all be all,
there are other methods, but this is how I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been pretty cost effective,
time effective, just really laid back and
[SPEAKER_00]: easy for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, you know, I'm just going to
show you guys that and hopefully it helps
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, first thing I like
to do is just set up my space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to have a clean workspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have all my stuff out so that
once I get started, I don't have to stop,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm thinking about that,
I'm thinking about I've got a pair of
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves here off camera that I'm going to
put on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something quickly that you'll see is that
cleanliness is the name of the game as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as this goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I think like if you start with a
healthy plant and you do clean cuts,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've messed around a lot with this and had
tons of failures and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think overall, the biggest thing
that I took away was keep it simple,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the environment nice and you can you
can make this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got my gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my gloves on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I do is I have these
disposable scalpels.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pretty helpful to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just keeps it really clean and easy and
just no mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just going to open that up here and we
are going to get us a fresh scalpel blade
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to set this off to the
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see I also have some clean
scissors here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like my scissors to be doing any
cutting on the stem or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you what those are for in a
little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, just some clean scissors to have
ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for my clone gel, I've been using
this Dip and Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, there's a thousand products on
the market for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm not a I'm not a sponsor by
any of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have seemed like they work and
that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, just I think it is important
to use one just to give yourself a leg up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that's there and available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clone without it, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, you know, everything to give
yourself a leg up is great in my book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have all that stuff ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a plant there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just over here to the side,
I have some rockwool cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little they're just been soaking
in a bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I like to do with that,
my thought process behind that is that
[SPEAKER_00]: when you buy rockwool cubes, if you read
the packaging there, they say that they
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be kind of buffered as far as pH
goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I like to do is mix up my
nutrients at just a really light strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like to just pH my water to
about like five point eight, five point
[SPEAKER_00]: nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to just let it soak in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I let the cubes set in there at a
minimum 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have like a little bubbler that I
run through the day and just kind of let
[SPEAKER_00]: them sit there and helps, you know,
get off gas, some of the chlorine in the
[SPEAKER_00]: water and that kind of thing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got my I've just got a weak
nutrient solution mixed up over there with
[SPEAKER_00]: the cubes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to take these cuts off of healthy
plants, obviously, the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have been watered this morning and they're
they're looking good, looking nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: full and ready to take some cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that I have everything ready,
something that I like to do for this
[SPEAKER_00]: technique, I like to do the callus
technique and I'll show you what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like to take my rockwool cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with like this little hole in it,
but it doesn't have any hole in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if you can see on these trays,
there's an edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: X down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have the clone sticking
directly out of the bottom of the cube,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will it will be hitting on that X.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I like to do is I just have this
little metal skewer and I take it,
[SPEAKER_00]: go into the hole and I go at just like a
little bit of an angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that maybe like a 40 maybe not
even a 45 degree angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just pierced down through and I come
out the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to do this so that you're
creating a channel for the clone to go
[SPEAKER_00]: into and you're not having to like push
the tissue through the rockwool cube and
[SPEAKER_00]: causing tissue damage to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have that sitting there, have a
little label set there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to mention that just because it is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to get these things mixed up
when you're doing a bunch of cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just take your time and make sure you
label them and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know if that's your vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this plant and what I like to
do is I'm shooting to get like a maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: four to six inch cutting off of this plant
is what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some small clones obviously that
are in solo cups and I'm just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: just have them back up so that I can go
ahead and flower these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do is I like to come
down to say a node like this right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives us like a nice you know four
or five inch cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to try to be as steady as I
can and I'm going to come down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to try to give myself as much
space below that node as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you why here in just a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that that's a good clean angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to actually do this all frame so
that I can get a good clean cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah I am just going down into that
little groove and we're cutting off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you can see from here plant is
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's you know there's now it's been
topped essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have this apical cutting and I'm
going to remove these nodes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get up in here and I'm just going
to remove these nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take all these off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got my scalpel upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I have this like one two and a
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got two nodes like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's pretty much how I like my
cuts to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I'm going to take this and it's
going to go into the dip and grow for just
[SPEAKER_00]: a few seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come right out and then we're going to go
straight into this cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I like to do is it's going
to push out the bottom like so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to clean that little bit of
rock wool off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see I've got this cut like so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so I just leave a little bit of
the tip sticking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's where I come in with the
scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that a lot of people do this for
various reasons to help water loss and
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to just take the tips of the leaves
off really just as a growth indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because yeah I will I'll show you how I do
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clip these off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have these leaves in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to personally take the tips off of
these right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only reason I like to do that is
so that like I said a growth indicator
[SPEAKER_00]: when the clone starts to grow and that
kind of thing you can it's sometimes hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell if it's like new growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just you know kind of take them off
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also does help with water loss through
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something you know it's
something that I like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly have heard arguments that it
can you know you can introduce an
[SPEAKER_00]: infection in doing that that kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not a necessary step.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not interested in it that's
perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have this cut just like so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to just label it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that is going to we're going to
sit that down in our tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue to take a few more
cuts but I would then just put the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity dome on this tray and have it
closed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I close the vents up and I go over into my
little clone tent where I have the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: tray sitting on top of a heat mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to have the heat mat set
somewhere around 80 degrees maybe 78.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll I'll have the humidity dome
on it and I'll keep the humidity dome
[SPEAKER_00]: vents closed for the first week entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after a week I'll start to take a
look at them and see what the roots are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't like to look at the clones
at all for the first week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to touch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to mess with the little
microclimate that the humidity dome
[SPEAKER_00]: creates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want them to focus on making roots
and then then I'll you know tend to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they are nice and rooted I'll go
ahead and open up the vents on the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity dome and kind of let make sure
that the rockwool cubes dry out nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously it's a small cube so you need to
keep an eye on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once they're ready you know once
they're ready to be watered again you can
[SPEAKER_00]: you know you can go ahead and transplant
to your medium and water them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I like to just keep them in
the cubes for like another week and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just dip them completely in the nutrient
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them back in the tray and that way I
get like a nice formed root mass before I
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant into soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then once I transplant I like to leave
them in their new containers in the clone
[SPEAKER_00]: tent environment for the first week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just transition them out into
my veg tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah hopefully that answers a bunch of
questions that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any kind of questions as far
as taking cuts goes please feel free to
[SPEAKER_00]: join the Breeder Syndicate Discord and
myself or tons of other way more
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledgeable people are there that can
help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah cheers and happy growing everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
