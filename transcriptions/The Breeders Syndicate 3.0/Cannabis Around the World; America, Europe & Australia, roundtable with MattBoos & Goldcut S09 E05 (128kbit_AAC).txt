[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_02]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_02]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_02]: seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_02]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The syndicate is a collection of seed
makers that want to push back against all
[SPEAKER_02]: the smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_02]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Matthew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here with my co-host, Thousandfold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we are going to be talking about
cannabis around the world from America to
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe, to Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today I have my good friend,
Goldcutt, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Seedco Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you even Goldcutt?
[SPEAKER_02]: And our good buddy, Matt Bouge from Group
I Seeds over in Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got Austria in Australia to confuse
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for being here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pleasure to have you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought we would warm up by just going
around and saying like, how long have you
[SPEAKER_04]: been growing slash involved with the
plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what have you liked growing or smoking
recently?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, Bouge, you start.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, hey guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've been growing since 2015 now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I started smoking 2011.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just normal shit at school.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone was smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty common over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think like most people at school,
generally like grade 11, 12 would start
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's more common than not.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, from then on, man got into it
from a more sort of advanced level started
[SPEAKER_05]: getting into the genetics and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like prior to that, the scene over here,
you could only really get one type of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was obviously bush and stuff if
you knew someone, but for the most part,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's been sort of like gang run for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the same sort of shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like compact PGR stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: That everyone was getting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So prior to getting exposure to cannabis,
that was sort of my only real knowledge of
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then when I was 17, I went over to
Europe and spent some time in Switzerland
[SPEAKER_05]: for sort of 12 months living over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I started to see what cannabis
could really be like.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of stuff from Amsterdam and that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, sort of when I came home,
it was back to the old shit again,
[SPEAKER_05]: the old compact PGR.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, just started growing after that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thought, you know, this is going to be
better than this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I can't get it, I'll have to do it
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only recently seen what you're
referring to as compact PGR like pictures
[SPEAKER_02]: of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you sent them to me or someone
did.
[SPEAKER_02]: A thousand maybe sent me some.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was surprised because I thought like,
I mean, I'm used to California bad,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's comparable, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm going to I think booze and I
will have a little exchange about that
[SPEAKER_04]: later on when we talk about the flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Locally available.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not it's not much different,
actually, than our Mexican for here,
[SPEAKER_02]: like for Americans or if you were in
California growing up or Mexican brick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be akin to that,
maybe for you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll talk about it in a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this stuff is something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, wait, it was before before we moved to
Gold Cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you liked growing and smoking
recently?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, since coming into the syndicate,
I've obviously gotten a lot of extra gear
[SPEAKER_05]: prior that it was just like finding random
breeders on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really hard to get seeds into
Australia unless you're trying to get
[SPEAKER_05]: through like fucking I love growing
marijuana or seeds, man, or something like
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's going to be a lot of
generic like hit and miss shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, man, since coming into the
syndicate, I've grown a bunch of just done
[SPEAKER_05]: some blue TK from Matt that I've been
smoking on this morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: What else?
[SPEAKER_05]: A bit of some outdoor shit, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing some sativa stuff now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got some A5 Hayes BC from Lush.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm planning on doing a big run of
them in the greenhouse this summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm a bit more into that stuff,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see Wally stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a bunch of some waiting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's tricky because like we were
talking about, I want to really get into
[SPEAKER_05]: growing plants outdoors and doing some
breeding for outdoors, similar to what
[SPEAKER_05]: Wally's done.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of the shit like the I got C5
Mango, Mango Hayes IBL, but I got like 40,
[SPEAKER_05]: 50 of each.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm sort of waiting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to pop them all at once and have a
look at that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll put that on the back burner.
[SPEAKER_05]: For a little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out Wally Duck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wally's a legend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for that, Booze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Goldcutt, you know, how long have
you been involved with the plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you get involved with the plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then secondarily, what have you been
enjoying growing and or smoking recently?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it started getting involved
with the plant in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a gardener's, a little
gardener's plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a apprenticeship and master's
degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during that time, I already got in
contact, but I think really what really
[SPEAKER_00]: made me start to cultivate was we didn't
want to buy hash from the hash bars,
[SPEAKER_00]: the shady hash bars in Vienna anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was kind of, I think that was
kind of the motivation because we all
[SPEAKER_00]: found out through a bunch of guys in
Vienna found out through high-end
[SPEAKER_00]: magazines that there are seeds in that you
can cultivate at home and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's how we got started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I collected back seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very early on, I collected back seeds
and I started those at one point at my
[SPEAKER_00]: mom's place and had a bunch of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there on, I think I never stopped
cultivating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I recently did and liked was most
of the time most of the chemi stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like that stuff a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: When did you start seeing the chemi stuff
show up, like legit chemi stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we, my team brought it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it kind of fairly, it happened
long after it was here, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you had to really work to get it
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that most of the representations
of whatever they call chem is what you
[SPEAKER_00]: often talked about, you know, a certain
illusion or a desperate wish to have
[SPEAKER_00]: something authentic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of it is crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think through a bunch of breeder
from abroad, it's now possible for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody to enjoy a good chem cross or
just a chem D or whatever you choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's much more available now through
repeatable people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was talking to someone earlier
about an old cut that I was one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: last people to have and watched it die.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're pretty sure that they have
this cut, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But they've never smoked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know the person they got it
from, never smoked it, never been around
[SPEAKER_02]: for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a brand new person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they sourced it from this person,
but they said they were waiting to smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: it to see if it's real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point I was kind of like,
but is that going to answer your questions
[SPEAKER_02]: on whether it's real or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think it's interesting
that a lot, but many years later,
[SPEAKER_00]: we, we here find out that super skunk was
something can be something, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of many years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people kind of, I think they got it all
mixed up with, with other skunks that are
[SPEAKER_00]: far from, from, from this direction.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it like, realistically, like we were
trying to convince you guys to buy
[SPEAKER_02]: something that was probably already over
there in a similar fashion, just a
[SPEAKER_02]: different name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But poorly selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Poorly selected super skunk over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, or Shiva skunk or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shiva was popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a long time, for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Shiva, for those listening,
was NL5 skunk one, I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you both for, yeah, getting us
warmed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, today's episode really,
all we're doing is we're going to go
[SPEAKER_04]: through some of the, you know,
basic things like, you know, what sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: flowers available, where you are,
what kinds of seeds, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: historically, what's the culture been
like, legality.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll run through some of these basic
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would also like to preface everyone
that of course, not a single one of us can
[SPEAKER_04]: perfectly represent where we come from,
or like be a perfect authority.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speak for yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, Matt obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolute knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolute knowledge of everything American.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll just try to give like our
perspective, you know, anecdotes from what
[SPEAKER_04]: we know, however fragmentary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, we just hope there'll be an
interesting conversation and maybe we'll
[SPEAKER_04]: learn some things about different places
and how they've approached the plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And saying that as, as we, as we all know,
America's always going to be the like
[SPEAKER_04]: point of reference.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can grow Matt whenever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make fun of America.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, don't hesitate to ask each other
like questions as we go along.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first, I think the first topic that
I wanted to get to was just, just legal
[SPEAKER_04]: status.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, where is your country's last
region in terms of legality right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Booze, maybe we start with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've currently got a model of medical
legalization happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been happening since 2017 or 18.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I had a, uh, a mate or acquaintance,
whatever, who was like one of the first
[SPEAKER_05]: patients in Australia and he, uh,
he had a brain tumor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that was the type of condition that
you had to have, uh, to get onto the
[SPEAKER_05]: medical registrar to begin with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it was extremely expensive as
well, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a thousand bucks an ounce and
it was, you know, all Canadian shit
[SPEAKER_05]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, now we're at a model where,
uh, people are cultivating.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's cultivation licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I haven't seen any of it, like any of
the Australian stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only shit I've seen, like I'm not on
the medical or anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the only shit I've seen is a Canadian
and it's all like, it's actually
[SPEAKER_05]: reminiscent of that shit that I saw in my
youth, man, a little bit, like not in
[SPEAKER_05]: terms of like, you know, I don't,
I don't have to PGR or whatever,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's some compact shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's overdried.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it doesn't have a lot of a smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear a lot of it's irradiated as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is obviously products,
but you know, it's far from good in my
[SPEAKER_05]: opinion at the moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but yeah, aside from that,
you know, it's been decriminalized to grow
[SPEAKER_05]: two plants in the ACT.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, uh, down in Canberra,
just fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it's where like all the politicians
are.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like this tiny little state,
I guess, similar to like Washington DC,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and that's, that's the one place
that they've, uh, they've voted that you
[SPEAKER_05]: can grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, that's a trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's well, that's sort of it at the
moment, like the medical license.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was speaking to a guy about this
recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is so being geared towards Chad's.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same as everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you know, even a research
license, you know, yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's sort of been, you know,
taking the keys to the kingdom type
[SPEAKER_05]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've, uh, yeah, I've been a bit
pessimistic about the whole thing,
[SPEAKER_05]: but in terms of actual like legality,
like getting busted and stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's pretty tame here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like unless you've, I know people that
have been done with, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: upwards of a hundred plants and they've
just gotten fine slap on the wrist,
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, it's nothing major.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's pretty conducive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Growing environment, obviously the outdoor
environment as well, everything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty fucking conducive to growing
cannabis down under.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, yeah, I'm, I'm seeing a lot more
of it now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I didn't know any growers,
like my, my fucking dream when I was young
[SPEAKER_05]: was like, man, I just need to find like
one of these old hippies that they're
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about and just get weed from him.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like where's these old dudes with the
bushes out of the back.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so back in the day, yeah,
didn't know a lot of growers, but now it
[SPEAKER_05]: seems just everyone and their mom's
cultivating man.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, an overgrow type model.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, I'm, I'm jealous.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, New Zealand is definitely not
quite at the same point.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no degree of decriminalization
anywhere yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we do have a fairly fledgling medical
scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah, in terms of like
cultivation, I can only assume that there
[SPEAKER_04]: are a whole lot of growers in this
country.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't actually know that for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, one other relevant historical point is
that we did have a referendum,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, on, uh, decriminalization,
um, a few years ago and sadly it did not
[SPEAKER_04]: go through narrowly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, as you know, as you know this,
um, which was heartbreaking, very tragic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, uh, and other than that, similar to
what you said, Bruce, at least in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: what I've found, uh, enforcement,
I would say, they're generally pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: tolerant towards like consumers and small
growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, it's, I think it's very rare to
see, um, anyone on that end of things get
[SPEAKER_04]: properly prosecuted, but, uh, definitely
if you make it their problem, they will
[SPEAKER_04]: still do something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you fill a house full of plants
and people know it can see it or smell it,
[SPEAKER_04]: like you're still going to get something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's a, it's definitely a
regional thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the country is a thin strip of land
that kind of goes North to South.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you do get a few different climates,
uh, down the length of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I imagine some, uh, I imagine
further up North would be a lot better
[SPEAKER_04]: than, uh, down South towards the South
pole.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've grown some rudorabas or something,
but yeah, I had a buddy, um, it's just,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, obviously that the land of the
long green cloud connotation, but,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, I had a buddy that lived in the North
Island and she had, you know, uncles and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff who would enter the Hills on quad
bikes and come back with garbage bags and
[SPEAKER_05]: shit like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wondered if that was that it ever
made its way, set it down to where you
[SPEAKER_05]: are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I imagine they're parts of the country,
which are like, I dunno, maybe like
[SPEAKER_04]: California or like Colorado, um,
climate wise, I'm just guessing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't actually know this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I think, I think there are some
really good spots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah, I mean, implicitly I will,
uh, uh, we didn't include New Zealand in
[SPEAKER_04]: this, in the title of the episode,
but I will speak to it whenever I can.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any links to the traditional
market really.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, gold cut legality in Austria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe, I don't know if you want to
speak for Europe as well, maybe in a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit, broad stroke it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, uh, uh, Austria is a weird example
amongst the European countries because
[SPEAKER_00]: here you can buy seeds and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy grow equipment in a lot of
grow shops, uh, for the size of our
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's quite, uh, quite big in
comparison to other countries around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, with the legality, um,
for instance, we can produce plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: sell them as ornamental plants,
more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to, you have to, uh, inform your
customers that those plants should not be
[SPEAKER_00]: used for, you know, potential,
uh, illegal drug production or sales of
[SPEAKER_00]: any types of things, you know,
that are not legal in Austria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, but when it comes to in there,
there is a lot of cultivation going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: Austria, a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from everything from the home grower
with a tent in his apartment, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: to very big facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run by, you know, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organizations are guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I think what, what the Austrian,
especially the police deal wants is to
[SPEAKER_00]: make money with pulling you over,
fucking with your driver's license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sending you to peace test, you know,
this machine behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to, you have to give urine tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got busted with 0.2 grams 20 years ago
or 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to give peace test every three
months, every three months, every three
[SPEAKER_00]: months for three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought you meant like they could
pull you over on the side of the road and
[SPEAKER_02]: make you piss right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they get you to the police office and
let you piss there every three months for
[SPEAKER_04]: three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it, it changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's diff, it's different now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's even even even worse now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the legality is, you know, it really
depends in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say for me in Vienna, it's,
it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smell weed everywhere, you know,
but on the country side, it's a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's barely any.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's no acceptance on the
countryside for, you know, drug people
[SPEAKER_00]: from the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: How there is medical, but as far as I
know, and don't quote me on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you only, there's only a chance for you to
get into a medical program where you get
[SPEAKER_00]: thrown up in all.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everything else failed, all the other
therapies failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even that I think is pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is, there is an Austrian state state
funded cannabis production, but they sell
[SPEAKER_00]: all the products to Germany to make it all
up in all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, big question mark when it comes
to legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to add here that in terms of
accessing medical in New Zealand,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's actually relatively easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say that there are few barriers
to getting access to medical beyond it
[SPEAKER_04]: costing a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gold cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in, in terms of like the countries
around you, what's going on with like
[SPEAKER_04]: Germany, I've heard some things about
Germany possibly opening up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you think that'll affect where you
are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think every surrounding country,
all the neighboring countries of Germany
[SPEAKER_00]: will be affected by it because I mean,
people will say, Hey, we want that too,
[SPEAKER_00]: without knowing what it means to have a
new regulations and seeing what unfolds
[SPEAKER_00]: there is like, everybody was so
enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full of legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're like, you can have clubs,
but they cannot, there's no social
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, everything has a thousand questions
that even the guys who made the laws
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot answer if you ask me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but look at Germany, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge fucking country with a lot
of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be very interesting in the
next two to five years to see where
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany is heading.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's my neighboring country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I speak German.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can understand as a, as a big clone
producer for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I do look at Germany and think,
Oh, imagine having a couple of companies
[SPEAKER_00]: there producing for the German market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would have big consequences
for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I heard already, what made me
laugh was the Austrian border police to
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany, to Bavaria is ringing the alarms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need more people because there's
going to be a bunch of smuggling and from,
[SPEAKER_00]: from Bavaria, which is even, it's so,
so, so strict against cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I don't even think they will have
clubs there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but the Austria is sounding the
alarm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: My Swiss buddies, they won't even smoke
anymore in the wintertime when they want
[SPEAKER_05]: to go skiing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I go skiing up near Bavaria
obviously and have the drive through
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's weird because Bavaria think like
Hofbohr house and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people getting pissed,
but yeah, but not tolerated.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you guys got a decriminalized model
for CBD?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like can you similar to Switzerland?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you just go to the shops and get CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is everywhere.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD turned into a commodity, a lifestyle
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a recreational product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like flowers or just the flowers and oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just a trip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause like, how are they going to know?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got a bag of CBD weed or a bag
of herb, like that's what it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: confused the cops here and they were
pissed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were pissed at the industry because
people got busted and they had the jars
[SPEAKER_00]: from the shop, but with their own stuff in
it and they had even have a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: receipt from the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I had from the shops and it
caused a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also people thought that they can smoke
CBD and drive, but you are not negative.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if it's that like 1%, 2% or whatever,
it's still going to come up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it over a certain time and I
think some of the, you know, some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD flowers that people sold were not 0.2,
0.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 1% and more, you know,
so yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you smoke it on a regular basis,
like cigarettes, and then you get pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: over and yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked two years in the CBD industry in
Austria for a big producer and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could do an episode just about that if
you're interested.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a good segue because the next
section is just going to be us talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that obviously we all will not
have further insights into like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, what people are growing and
breeding and you know, what seeds are
[SPEAKER_04]: available.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I thought for this first section,
we just pretend we don't know as much
[SPEAKER_04]: about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just talk about what flower you have
observed to be available, like whether in
[SPEAKER_04]: terms of like trends or in terms of things
that stood out to you or any of those
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, booze.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously we can talk traditional
we can talk about what you know of legal
[SPEAKER_04]: flower as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, impressions of flower,
you know, maybe growing up and what you
[SPEAKER_04]: see on the market now and.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I touched up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in Australia, heavy days has actually
gone over this, but yeah, there was two
[SPEAKER_05]: traditional types of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get the bush or you get the hide.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hydro, I went over.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the most part, it was just the PGE,
the PGR, compact, whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_05]: call it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was funny about that, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Australia-wide.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd see photos of like from Melbourne
and even you in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like it was the same shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it was like the same
cutting that was passed around and grown
[SPEAKER_05]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you take a moment like elaborating
what PGR means and is?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to pick while you do
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, PGR obviously plant growth
regulator.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of products that have
PGRs.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's natural PGRs like Tricontinol,
Malfalfa and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this one in particular, they were
using like Budswell products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it was weird, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flower resulted in this clumpy,
covered in red hairs, massive stems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you get these tiny little claw
leaves, but they had like massive stems on
[SPEAKER_05]: them on the little like bud leaflets.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was strange.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of smelled basement-y, you know,
like a musky sort of smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't really go into the high because it
was fucking pretty non-existent,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you know, general sort of narcotic
thing, which when I've spoken to Crybaby
[SPEAKER_05]: and a lot of people and Matt you as well,
obviously people have this opinion that
[SPEAKER_05]: Australians are really into sativas.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think because of this shit,
most people sort of tend to look at
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis as like a narcotic experience
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, because of this, this PGE,
a lot of people have, I guess,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, just associate the indigo
high with cannabis, but yeah, aside from
[SPEAKER_05]: that man, the bush.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I always loved bush whenever I could
get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Nimbin is a town a lot of people have
heard of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nimbin is probably two and a half as the
crow flies driving from me like two and a
[SPEAKER_05]: half hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd head there probably like once a
week when I was getting older and just
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't want to be around the PGR shit
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And trafficable amounts are probably about
two ounces here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I didn't want to exceed
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I was heading down there every
week, every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get bush and it was my preference.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, generally it was a more of a
sativa sort of experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big green chunky resinous flowers,
tropical smells.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd get hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was actually where I got my first
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my first growers were from seeds from
that bushweed from down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'd get hydro as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd get, you know, shit that slap a name
on, green crack, jacarere, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: cookies, stuff like that, which was a lot
more expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, the bush man, yeah, you get
decent rates.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that and then obviously medical these
days, as I said, it's not the greatest,
[SPEAKER_05]: but yeah, better than it used to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: At least you can sort of, you know,
get some variety now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, you can get a blue dream
or a GMO or whatever their version of that
[SPEAKER_05]: is.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, on the street.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't bought reefer in a long,
long time, but yeah, I'm just seeing,
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the quality would be then a lot
more people growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd probably be better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know anything about like,
I know that in New Zealand, it's become
[SPEAKER_04]: popular field to just like get weed
locally on Instagram and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like have you seen any of that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, what do people grow or like what
are people selling?
[SPEAKER_05]: For a while, there was a few groups in
Australia that were doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: When the first like carts, like the hot
dog water carts and shit were coming out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, people were fucking getting weed
and trimming the hell out of it and
[SPEAKER_05]: calling it Cali and stuff like that,
selling it for 1000 bucks an ounce.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot of a lot of that kind of
shit going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cali tins, just all that wanky shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: But since medical, a lot of that's gone
out the window because like the price of
[SPEAKER_05]: medical is cheaper than a lot of that was.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's usurp to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, there was a lot through
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I for the last time I was buying
cannabis that would have been through
[SPEAKER_05]: Instagram for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, I put a link into the chat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you want to like see if
you can share the picture because I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see Goldcutt's expert reaction
to this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, funny thing is Goldcutt might know
because when I was in Vienna, man,
[SPEAKER_05]: the thing that fucked me up was I went to
like Planet Ham for whatever one of these
[SPEAKER_05]: head shops and people buying seeds and I'd
be like, okay, so the seeds for sale,
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever, you'll be able to find some some
good shit on the street and then end up
[SPEAKER_05]: buying weed on the street.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one too dissimilar to this.
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's so small.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a bag with what what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks so weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bunch of hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like it's mostly covered with stigma.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a 70s porno, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a 70s porno, just all bushed,
no resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like CBD flowers from the shops
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even our CBD flowers don't look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of the some of the stuff in these
mylars does look similar to this shit that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been seeing lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of it I've noticed that looks
really bad or it has discolored is from
[SPEAKER_02]: going through something they're doing to
try to get through our medical system,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is washing it with hydrogen
peroxide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a dirty ass secret, but that's
like, I don't J boys tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I say that without getting sued?
[SPEAKER_02]: J boys tech where they would, wham,
fucking dip it so they could pass all the
[SPEAKER_02]: tests of fucking GM and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just need to hydrogen peroxide
dip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, a lot of it ends up looking
discolored, oxidized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, putting it in hydrogen
peroxide, you're going to oxidize it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, so those of you guys do that over
there yet?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they do it here too, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they do that in Australia and New
Zealand?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hydrogen peroxide dips?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys familiar with that?
[SPEAKER_05]: They irradiate it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell does that mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they put it through some sort of
radiation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's relative to fucking fungus or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gamma ray.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gamma ray.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the consequences of that,
dude?
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking no turps, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sayonara turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the biggest thing, I'll say.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I mean, the consequences of
smoking something that's been irradiated.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have some fucking
supervillains that don't know what good
[SPEAKER_05]: weed is in the next few years,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say, it'd be the same
kind of radiation that they expose certain
[SPEAKER_04]: food products to as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Important for its invention.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're not smoking those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the thing when you bring in...
But it's standardized.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think everyone's had a good look
at this excellent example of sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you put it away?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're lucky, I kind of like looking at
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns me on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, same question.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of the flower that you see on the
street, I guess, both maybe when you're
[SPEAKER_04]: growing up and what do you see more
recently on the street?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started consuming cannabis in
general, there was a park dealers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to a park or you go to a cafe,
like I told you, there were illegal hash
[SPEAKER_00]: bars where you go and wait five hours or
three hours, or you go to a park and buy
[SPEAKER_00]: from a dealer and they sold you each...
You can buy grams of hash from,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was from Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were lucky, some of them had
Afghani, but most of it was from Morocco,
[SPEAKER_00]: very cheap Moroccan hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when home growing and import
started, it changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those bars then sold flowers,
imported flowers from... I think some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them were Dutch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest was from Germany,
from illegal growth in Germany that also
[SPEAKER_00]: supplied Holland with flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just sold it to other markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when home growing really started
to take off and clones, I think what
[SPEAKER_00]: people sold or had was what was available
as a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were all Dutch genetics,
all of them, like white Russian,
[SPEAKER_00]: Euphoria, Big Bud, Super Skunk,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of those, Sanity, Dutch Passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those trains were around for very
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also, at one point, I think
everything was played out and the
[SPEAKER_00]: customers and the guys that smoked those
products were not interested anymore and
[SPEAKER_00]: it changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also what some of the seed banks that
you guys know from abroad, from your
[SPEAKER_00]: country, started to bring over to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that changed what people started to
accept as the new norm because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: produced as clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those seeds ended up in nurseries
as mother plants and were sold as clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Adi.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting that you mentioned some
of the influence from the US.
[SPEAKER_04]: For a moment, I just want to ask Boos
whether or not he... Was there any kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: palpable influence coming from the US that
you observed, Boos?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got all that shit, like the glow trays
and the little cookies, mylar bags and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very true.
[SPEAKER_05]: You said this about the Spanish scene as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Matt said at the start of the episode,
man, everything is just an imprint of the
[SPEAKER_05]: US.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the pioneers in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: In modern cannabis, at least, breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, man, I see a lot of parallels.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the stuff I see being grown these
days is like cookies, gelato, chub,
[SPEAKER_05]: mac offsets, all that kind of shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're definitely getting to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the next section was actually going to
be on clones already.
[SPEAKER_04]: But gold card back to you for a moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nio, is there anything else about the
flower that tends to be available there
[SPEAKER_04]: that you wanted to comment on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it changed a lot from the beginning
of the influence of the Spanish market,
[SPEAKER_00]: of Catalonia and a bunch of regions in
Spain that produce a lot of products for
[SPEAKER_00]: the European market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it changed to amnesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything turned into amnesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was this...
[SPEAKER_00]: The amnesia phantom, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knew where it's from because
everybody had the same amnesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was at a certain point so flooded
that even average Joe Schmo on the street
[SPEAKER_00]: bought amnesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bag of the friend where I bought
was amnesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So various qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And either imported or also grown here
because the clone was also available here
[SPEAKER_00]: and is still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it changed to amnesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people started to accept the fact
that some of your American strains were
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty valuable on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could sell for a very high price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the beginning of the end of
wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where huge legal facilities started to
grow wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was potent, the clone is really
good and the market loved it and totally
[SPEAKER_00]: destroyed the price of their own product
with just flooding the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that no one would have
grown, let's say 15 years back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a huge lengthy plant, ugly and
difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't have yielded enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole lot about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it turned into a cheap commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder what's going to be the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think something like RS-11 or lemon
cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other problem that came with wedding
cake was the HLV Viroid being passed
[SPEAKER_02]: around to your neighbors via things like
the wedding cake that were being spread
[SPEAKER_02]: rapidly like GG4.
[SPEAKER_02]: The actual clone was making it to Europe
because there was such a demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: They finally get it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the Viroid was already here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was already here, the Viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think so?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that is in a lot of
ornamental plant facilities and gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was always poorly treated with even
bigger production companies here that
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't take care of it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just a matter of time and years
where everybody grew the fuck out of,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, trainwreck and amnesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially the court court.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a matter of time that all
those moms were infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good segue into the clones side
of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about US influence, obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: But do you perceive that Australia also
was influenced by Europe?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we see much of amnesia haze down here
or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I meant by that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I wasn't discredited in Europe at
all.
[SPEAKER_05]: But originally, that shit came from the
States.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then over to Europe when this worked,
that's what I was getting at with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, we had a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of the first grows I saw were
like, you know, white widow, super lemon
[SPEAKER_05]: haze, that kind of stuff, like greenhouse,
barnies, all that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say same here.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a giant market for 30, 40 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still do, kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Realistically, greenhouse is still the big
seller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greenhouse and barnies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the big movers that nobody beats
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody can beat them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of volume of sales they do by,
you know, moving seeds for other vendors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Un-fucking-real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're first names everybody hears.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're the first people everybody
tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just, it's how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get everyone first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone bases their money.
[SPEAKER_02]: They base their experience growing on what
they got from them first, which is even
[SPEAKER_02]: more terrifying to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Booz, in terms of clones,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't actually know anything about
clones here, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: What people keep and pass around.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you know of what's kept and passed
around over there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, none of the shit that you'd want,
really.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not discrediting anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, none of the stuff like the old
hazes are like the old sativas,
[SPEAKER_05]: but like, you know, the old mullum and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's around in clone form.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's seeds, but yeah, all the shit
that Wally's got.
[SPEAKER_05]: So obviously at one stage they had like
the C5, the East Coast Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Aside from that, things that I've seen,
it's just seed pops, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of what's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's a double edged sword.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tricky because I've spoken about
baselines.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when we're popping seeds,
you know, it's not, we have a clone to
[SPEAKER_05]: compare it to, to be like, oh yeah,
that's as good as that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eli.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my, one of my good buddies,
local bird seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a real good guy from down under.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's doing some breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's, I'm actually smoking some of his
stuff this morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got some TV from Bodhi, the Thai
Vietnamese, the destroyer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so Eli's got some great cuttings.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got a Harlem dreams, Band-Aid hazes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a Sour TK from Ochi, Steel Violet
from Pip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some great cuttings to get around,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, aside from that, there's,
Dan is a guy that's done some work with a
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeti OG, which is like a Loomis headband,
Humboldt Snow.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been working that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried some of that recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, there's nothing, there's not
like a market like American, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not like you put your finger on it
and be like, oh, there's the sour or the
[SPEAKER_05]: cam or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just seed pops for the most part,
but they're getting more prevalent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I try to share clones whenever I can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was going to say as well that there
isn't that same quality of globalness.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I mean by that is that like,
they're obviously going to be like lots of
[SPEAKER_04]: different pockets of growers scattered
around the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're probably not going to be like
clone hubs or like hubs for mothers and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I imagine in the same way as like US and
probably Europe as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a lot more like Australia is pretty
fucking big.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not like America where the whole
country is populated.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's you'll have pockets here
and pockets there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you'll have Brisbane and then the
next like capital city would be Cairns.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you know, nine hours,
10 hours north, more up Wally Ducks way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not, it's not like you'll have
like Sacramento and then Oakland and then
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking San Diego or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, there's not that degree of
sharing and localized clone trading and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with the medical, it's just all like,
it's all bullshit, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all like fucking cookies,
cush or like, you know, red bankness cut
[SPEAKER_05]: it or just, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be like a seed pop someone in Canada
did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, all right, let's,
let's take that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's fucking bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange aid or jet fuel gelato,
just booth on booth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause going back to gold cut, you know,
that is one difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: A go car obviously himself has some
experience like, um, facilitating like
[SPEAKER_04]: clones and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so go car in terms of the clone scene
where you are, how have you observed that
[SPEAKER_04]: to change?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you've been obviously embedded in
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know you may have mentioned some of
it already, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm producing clones since, uh,
for various companies since 2005,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2004, somewhere there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've seen changing was,
uh, from, uh, from Dutch seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: seed pops that most of those shops have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those seed pops were passed around
without asking to every shop, just stole
[SPEAKER_00]: the cards from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has the same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was at one point ridiculous because
everybody had the same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, yeah, like I told you
already changed because of the influence
[SPEAKER_00]: of American seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the first ones were,
was a lot of, was a lot of DNA and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of TGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that came, um, in regular seats from
some guys selected or some guys in Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: selected and passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at one point bigger production
facilities in Austria had those cuts and
[SPEAKER_00]: produced them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was, there was, there was a lot
of TGA around and that changed,
[SPEAKER_00]: changed, I think what people expected from
a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it feels, it split it up in so many
directions, the motivation behind why you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and why you cultivate at home or for
what reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smoke, you don't smoke,
you cultivate for someone, you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate because of financial interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, I was not surprised because I've
seen a lot of different aspects very early
[SPEAKER_00]: when I traveled to the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I could, uh, you know,
um, I had the most of, most of the friends
[SPEAKER_00]: that I visited had a, let's say a hippie
background or, or parents from you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the hippie generation and they had
their smoke or their habits or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, their, you know, what they had
around cuts they had and what they
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first impression was more in this
direction, uh, that I was very well aware
[SPEAKER_00]: that the quality was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere I went, everybody had amazing
smoke compared with coming back home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I noticed when I started like early on
working with my friend, Ed Borg from Delta
[SPEAKER_02]: nine labs, who was in Amsterdam,
I noticed early on, like some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: things that we were doing in the U S that
was marrying what this big corporation
[SPEAKER_02]: called bedrock on in Amsterdam was doing
at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I saw us taking some of their plays,
but making it more corporate driven as
[SPEAKER_02]: opposed to more like small criminal
organization driven, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I saw it, I saw it being more based
for like, uh, rich corporation people and
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the laws kind of twisting slowly
towards that, which is very American.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that, I've kind of always expected
it to be, you know, one overreaching
[SPEAKER_02]: corporation that it ends up being
everything funneled from one big place
[SPEAKER_02]: into one main, you know, how everything
kind of does everything kind of turns into
[SPEAKER_02]: a monopoly first when it becomes a
commodity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of see that happening every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everywhere and people having to fight back
over time because it's not going to happen
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to slowly lose more rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it doesn't necessarily surprise
me what's going on over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's only going to continue to
drizzle onto other countries that are
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding off of the USA's teat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I had quite a weird idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we'll have time to do it,
but maybe we could do it another time,
[SPEAKER_04]: which was for us to pull up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Burner's last YouTube video on visiting
Thailand and, uh, for us to kind of like
[SPEAKER_04]: comment on some of the things that he
quote unquote sees there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think we can save that for another.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be fun though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes global.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I will say that, um, this episode
that I'm about to refer to hasn't actually
[SPEAKER_04]: gone live yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going live later today.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, uh, but in the previous episode,
essentially Matt and I talk about,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, the, the state of information,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cannabis and how, how, how kind of
messed up it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, this had to do with like seeds
and flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but you know, we've talked about
flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked about clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think now we just open it all the way
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can talk about seeds as well on the
seed market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I want to, I want to know first of
all, from each of you, what was it like
[SPEAKER_04]: when you were first trying to navigate
through the bullshit that it is,
[SPEAKER_04]: that is like cannabis information online,
um, maybe in terms of like obtaining your
[SPEAKER_04]: first seeds or clones or whatever,
like how, what was that journey like and
[SPEAKER_04]: how long did it take for you to find
information that you thought was like
[SPEAKER_04]: actually reliable?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, maybe we start with booze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I actually kind of remember too much,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I think it was sort of, as I started
popping seeds, I started to look into like
[SPEAKER_05]: online shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was too young.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm only the 27.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was too young for overgrow and,
uh, the tail end of our CMAG and stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was really just, yeah, the bread,
it like it on Reddit search and shit up
[SPEAKER_05]: YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, pretty early on I got away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Savannah says book, which is, uh,
I had a little bit of grow information in
[SPEAKER_05]: it, like not a lot of, you know,
not a lot of good shit, but it had some,
[SPEAKER_05]: some good tidbits, a lot of cool pictures
of weed, local picks, like Charlie Garcia
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff and some cool stuff and yeah,
some shit from Chimera.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, yeah, I, well, man, not too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like, now I'm more into obviously the
discord, but that was the biggest step for
[SPEAKER_05]: me getting into the breeder syndicate
discord for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was where I sort of started to expand
on my genetic and grow knowledge,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, exponentially.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take note.
[SPEAKER_02]: This man's 27 and did his research and
fucking got to the bottom of some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anybody can do it at any age.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not an age thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have, I think I got very lucky
forums, none of that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, meeting you guys, I got very lucky,
I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and in the Australian scene,
I met a couple of people early that they
[SPEAKER_05]: got me into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a mentor, so to speak, like,
uh, my friend's dad who taught me a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: about growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, he'd been growing for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a cool, great guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Importer of, uh, things like that helps so
much helps so much to have that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that little bit of like hands-on
mentorship from somebody who's older and
[SPEAKER_02]: can teach you like the right ways to not
just to grow, but how to interact with
[SPEAKER_02]: other growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's super important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was, I think it could have gone a
lot different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Had I spent a lot of time online because
the first like tidbits I got from online
[SPEAKER_05]: were like a Humboldt seed co and like
greenhouse and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like, um, meeting my buddy's dad
early on was great because he was,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the shit we were growing was all
the old stuff from his old day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was all his like leftover seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So inbred a lot by this stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wasn't anything super fantastic,
but, you know, the remnants of tie and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff like that that he'd been getting
back in the day or he'd been importing
[SPEAKER_05]: Indonesian weed and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, man, it was cool learning from
him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then yeah, pretty soon to get this
cool and off she went.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, uh, you just dropped a tidbit that I
want to return to later, which is where
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the genetics in Australia actually
have come from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I have similar questions about New
Zealand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah, before that gold cut,
how about you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us about your initial journeys into
the cannabis information space.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what was that experience like?
[SPEAKER_04]: How long did it take for you to find
information that was useful, reliable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty, pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found out about ICMAC and, uh,
first I was only, I was only trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: find, uh, things that are interesting and
made sense for me, uh, for cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, without having an account,
but a lot of the threads were private.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could only go in with having an
account and adding something to the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I made an account and tried to
share what I did as a, as a, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: clone producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, but it was so slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like it was too slow for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The information wasn't, you know,
some of the people were not, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't feel really good about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a local forum, but there was
also, uh, I always had a gardening,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, uh, professional gardenings,
uh, take on, on what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was hard for me to find someone who
kind of shared this, this, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, the experience with a bigger
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no one out there, but,
but, uh, after a certain time,
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a couple of guys and I think one
of the first guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was actually also sub cool with some of
the bigger things that he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, also really enjoyed Dr.
Skanderson very, very early in one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: guys from YouTube also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and maybe he was a good friend of
mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maddy Cropper was also one of them,
which, uh, always enjoyed because bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities and kind of, uh, a different
type of, uh, take on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, through that, I think,
um, I kind of started to, to, to hack my
[SPEAKER_00]: way through bullshit information,
which was still out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a student, a lot of pro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was contradicting to what I learned
as a gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should I do with this info?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the products from the United
States were not available here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other stuff, but, uh, I think,
I think IC make was the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and yeah, the British cynical
discord is at the very end right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, not the end, but it is now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was, that was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so Boo's already kind of, um,
gesture towards this, but I was going to
[SPEAKER_04]: come back and ask like, now we're into
seeds, um, in terms, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: in all aspects, like what are people,
what seeds do you guys see people buying?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you see people growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, are there people making seeds locally
or actually breeding locally?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that you found interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to booze.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I know booze has quite a bit to
say about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he also has his own little seat bank
in Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so booze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, and feel free to repeat yourself as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we've talked, we've touched on
aspects of this already, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's what a C aspect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeds like men.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so yeah, going back to how far do we
want to go back?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we just talking like right now or
maybe like, uh, in the time that you have
[SPEAKER_04]: been involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I first got into it, as I said,
a lot of it was like, uh, the shit you'd
[SPEAKER_05]: see online was like Humboldt C code,
like choc mint OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I actually, what, before you go
further, why do you think companies like
[SPEAKER_04]: Humboldt seed co, uh, the first ones to be
visible?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to figure this out as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, they understood SEO early.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll say is probably it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Money too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, before Google changed a lot of the
algorithms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was because it was because they
were backed by Dynafam who was the biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: producer of seeds on earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the same company and had same
owners.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why they are so distributed
because the biggest seed company on earth
[SPEAKER_02]: is them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: HSC brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's two different ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: HSC, HSO.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both of them are big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, HSC not so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a smoke and mirrors thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: HSO for sure is massive.
Massive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But man, no, the, the weird thing we're
seeing is that HSC is still big in like
[SPEAKER_04]: seemingly both Australia and New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't still don't fully understand why.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's why booze was saying like,
it's partly SEO.
[SPEAKER_04]: They, they probably have quite a bit of
like social media stuff in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Matt, that one's always fucked with
me because I didn't realizations,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I think it's the Humboldt one,
the one that's got that, the, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: they always post pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way you can lose with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know,
[SPEAKER_05]: like they got some good marketing going
on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess early on, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause as we're talking like 2015 here and
also, um, yeah, at that time there wasn't,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, you know, there was way less podcasts
and shows and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the infancy of the American
league.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Limited a lot of information getting out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, but these days, man,
it's a bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So through go up by seeds, uh,
we stock a bunch of good breeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: So internationally I've got Matt,
I've got high and lonesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got some goat farm gear coming in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I stock white buffalo seeds as well for
the sativa stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then locally I've got three guys on
deck.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got Wally dark, obviously he's
phenomenal breeder, really respected guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't think I've ever heard a bad word
said about him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got my buddy, Southern sun seeds,
who was around on the mr.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice forum back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had a him on my little podcast
recently and he's, um, he's got a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: cool stuff from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got some lemon mazhar from Kanga.
[SPEAKER_05]: He works with some, uh, cutting of star
mocks, which is, um, uh, Mullum or Harkin
[SPEAKER_05]: NL five Hayes from Kanga just been crossed
the start of.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my buddy Eli cash locally as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's just, I said, popping a bunch of
cool shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's, uh, latest project is using,
uh, the TV.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got that Isaac Hayes from Yosemite,
uh, across to TV as well as the Harlem
[SPEAKER_05]: dream from PIF coast, which is killer
killer cutting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I run that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's phenomenal, beautiful, uplifting
daytime stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a bandaid Hayes cutting as well
from, from doc D.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, so there's some cool seeds
getting around, man, but that's,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, yeah, that's sort of still in its
infancy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I only started that last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the, the motive was to get better seed
out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause a lot of the stuff that I'd seen had
been, um, either, the imported shit that
[SPEAKER_05]: people were getting themselves,
you know, through like ILGM or attitude or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever, which was like a lot of bunk or
other local stuff that had been made
[SPEAKER_05]: available that I wasn't super jivey weird
that I thought, you know, we could do
[SPEAKER_05]: better.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, man, uh, that was pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been just on that trend, just looking
for, for cool stuff that I jive with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of it, I grow myself obviously
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it's been, it's been cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can reiterate on some of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what I, I observed in New Zealand
is similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you have a whole bunch of people who
are growing like the quote unquote,
[SPEAKER_04]: the big seed bank names, like greenhouse
Nirvana sensei, all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then you have the newer hypey
brands, like whatever it is, like thug
[SPEAKER_04]: pug, exotic, like all that stuff,
uh, in house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, those seem to be the kind of like main
things that I see like on Reddit and all
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I'd actually be really curious,
uh, whether there are people in New
[SPEAKER_04]: Zealand doing similar things to you and
your mates over there, where obviously you
[SPEAKER_04]: have access to quite a huge range of cool
stuff that you guys are working with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure they exist in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure there are people going to be
listening who are from New Zealand,
[SPEAKER_04]: who can probably tell us this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah, that's super cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's kind of one of the
benefits in a way of having such a
[SPEAKER_04]: fragmented scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually does in a way mean that at
least you're not the Holden to these major
[SPEAKER_04]: trends that everyone has to, you know,
revolve around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really cool to hear about like,
yeah, what you and some of the people
[SPEAKER_04]: around you are working on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gold cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you may have talked to some of
this in the last episode as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gold cut, but, um, yeah, feel free to not,
yeah, repeat yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so the question was seeds,
seed making, breeding locally,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, anything interesting going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you observed over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it, it, it constantly changes because
of the availability of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I see right now is that,
uh, there's a certain amount of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that is buying, like you said,
the certain trendy, uh, big, big ass Mylar
[SPEAKER_00]: brands from abroad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, and they pop them and,
uh, with the hope that they find something
[SPEAKER_00]: special out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's, that's one part of the guys
who buy seeds and pop those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's, there is of course,
uh, Spanish seed production buyer with the
[SPEAKER_00]: classic brands that we all know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also, I think are a big part of it
because they're so widely available and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, are also affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cheap, you know, they can buy a
bunch of seeds for very, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for very cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, yeah, those are the groups
that I see, um, are for my part,
[SPEAKER_00]: are for Matthew's work, the blue bonnet
line and the amazing hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people start to, uh, understand,
hey, okay, there's someone here that
[SPEAKER_00]: offers them and, and they try those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for most part, people, uh,
the, the, the biggest group is interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in feminized seeds still, which I don't
understand, but they still expect,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, wow, 10 seeds and they are not
feminized to where should I do the
[SPEAKER_00]: selection?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how should I handle them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that, you know, so I think,
but it's also a group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it splits up in those, yeah,
those, those groups that, uh, have
[SPEAKER_00]: different expectations from buying a pack
of seeds or popping seeds in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: but because we have so much clones
available here and a lot of the newest
[SPEAKER_00]: hype, uh, hype, uh, strains from,
from abroad with people who import them
[SPEAKER_00]: here and have libraries here somewhere in
central Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sell to those nurseries,
you know, in Austria also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a lot of those, uh,
sushi and tomatoes available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should you pop seeds for every show
is, yeah, I'll buy 22 bottles and pop
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what killed the U S seed
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's also why HLV took hold.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was a bunch of people who
didn't want to pop seeds because it seemed
[SPEAKER_02]: too much trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: What if one herms on me, et cetera,
still in that mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to mess with males for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they can't even identify a male.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them, you know, so yeah,
it's same kind of shit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: People wanted clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the clones here, why are we going to
buy seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all had clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all passed them dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order, the number of grown plants
here also started to change with the
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: People started with 20 plants and now they
go 200.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to pop 200 seeds every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not the best idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: 200 variants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I have a, I have a specific question
for booze here because I had the same
[SPEAKER_04]: question about New Zealand, which is where
some of the older seed stock has come
[SPEAKER_04]: from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think between the U S and Europe,
it's probably fairly well documented or
[SPEAKER_04]: discussed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I feel like for Australia and New
Zealand, I imagine quite a lot of early
[SPEAKER_04]: seed stock may have come from Southeast
Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm wondering Bruce, if you know much
about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, a little bit, man, like my,
uh, mate that I was talking about before
[SPEAKER_05]: he spoke a little bit on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he was in the eighties importing some
ties, some Indonesian stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was, I guess, the two sort of most
common varieties you'd find here,
[SPEAKER_05]: Indian, Indonesian, Thai, that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that like Laotian, Cambodian,
all that sort of stuff, that, that general
[SPEAKER_05]: area.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm speaking to guys like Wally and
talking to Sonny, uh, who was mates with
[SPEAKER_05]: Kanga.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to hear a little bit about what
they had around back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Kanga was like a world traveler.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had brought back stuff from California.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had some Indian stuff, some Thai,
Malam, obviously whole bunch of different
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Wally had his Laotian.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had some stuff from Papua New Guinea,
uh, which could incorporate into that,
[SPEAKER_05]: that Z 99 that he's got as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was, I guess, a lot of the
varietals that would have been found
[SPEAKER_05]: around here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot of South American stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never heard of any like Panama or
California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Columbia and anything like that being
grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think there was hearsay that there
may have been Colombian in Malam because
[SPEAKER_05]: Neville found it similar to bucket and
Hayes, whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I doubt that this is much more assumed
Thai or, or Indian because that's what was
[SPEAKER_05]: mostly coming in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, Wally told a tale about his,
uh, his mates that were going to India
[SPEAKER_05]: every year, getting seeds and bringing
them back even and growing them here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I heard, um, when a lot of the
cannabis production shifted from,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, Griffith down in New South Wales to up
in Mariba, which is, um, far closer to the
[SPEAKER_05]: equator.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the most conducive places on
earth to grow cannabis just because of the
[SPEAKER_05]: table and water and climate days of
sunshine, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So up in Mariba, I know they were growing
lots of Indian back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause when they had a massive bust up
there in the nineties, they had lots of
[SPEAKER_05]: Indian seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would have been, I guess,
what a lot of the old clones came from,
[SPEAKER_05]: like the Malam Bimbi madness, the old
mother sativa that cog has posted about
[SPEAKER_05]: and others.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be it for our old seed,
but not a lot of it is around still.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Wally lost a lot of his seed
collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kanga no longer around really.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Bucketbongs was a guy that was around
on the forums back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yeah, on the Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's got some, some mock seed still
from Kanga and some Malam Cruster Malawi
[SPEAKER_05]: as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of other bits and pieces,
some cool shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, yeah, man, there's, there's that
around still, but none of the old Thai,
[SPEAKER_05]: like I haven't seen anything like in
Nimbin though, you'll still get Bush that
[SPEAKER_05]: probably just sends from that,
but I wouldn't like, I wouldn't rate it
[SPEAKER_05]: that highly anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy's use of the word Bush kills me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: A bit of Bush.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say that it's cool
that it's not entirely derivative from
[SPEAKER_04]: what's going on in the U S and Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Australia has its own like,
you know, strange, like introgressions
[SPEAKER_04]: from elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, which is, it really has its own
culture there with the Nimbin stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you have your own like cannabis
superstars there, like Tony Malloway and
[SPEAKER_02]: people like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's a way, it's different than the U
S you have your own culture there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there's a fucking in kind of Bible
three, I think whenever it was that,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, Jason came to Australia, it was,
I think it kind of Bible too, maybe one of
[SPEAKER_05]: those photos.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was like Blackberry from Malloway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently it was really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it wasn't like no booze.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was super potent because he had no
booze in the same, in the same book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, damn so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I've always wanted to get his
Blackberry like in seed form, but I've
[SPEAKER_02]: never been able to get ahold of Tony
Malloway or anyone that in that has those
[SPEAKER_02]: seats, but that's one that I've wanted
forever because of that, that book.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Tony, I think I may have met him once
because I used to go to Nimbin often when
[SPEAKER_05]: I was doing like some blogging and shit,
but also getting weed obviously.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, one time I was invited downstairs
at the hemp embassy and there was a guy
[SPEAKER_05]: down there who had been making CBD seeds
and he was mates with Tony and Tony might
[SPEAKER_05]: have been there as well, but this was like
years and years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, Tony is a legend, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't heard of him in a long time,
but he was like put through the ring and
[SPEAKER_05]: he was one of the early pioneers making,
um, oil for sick kids, similar to smoking
[SPEAKER_05]: moose, um, from, from the forums back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another legend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just both super, um, altruistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moose no longer with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, no moose passed away.
[SPEAKER_05]: So moose and sunny Southern sun seeds,
my buddy, they were like best buds,
[SPEAKER_05]: like live right next to each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Moose shared a lot of the gear.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got from never when can go with sunny,
like the kush mul and tie and stuff like
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, yeah, but moose passed away,
unfortunately.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always talk about, I always got a shout
out moon unit because he was one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: dudes on Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we didn't really know each other too
well early on, but like we'd watch each
[SPEAKER_02]: other and he was so legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't get all those dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when someone was sandbagging me in the
middle of the deal and like kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: smiling to my face and he knew about it,
he made sure that I didn't get screwed
[SPEAKER_02]: over just cause he saw what was going on
and it was wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always thought those guys that whole
crew was always even Kanga Wally all been
[SPEAKER_02]: so solid to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I have a lot of respect for
the Australian growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're solid people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different than here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had never really heard of moon unit,
except you mentioned him once years ago
[SPEAKER_05]: when I reached out to you and Wally as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, everyone speaks of Wally
with such a reverence.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wally was like that about moon.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, man, this guy, he did what
never, never did.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he took three land races and
made something equivalent to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super, super cool man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he's still around.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Wally said they were talking,
but I'm not a hundred percent on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if he could get a hold of them,
if he could get a hold of the moon unit,
[SPEAKER_02]: it'd be killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just cause I have good memories of that
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like back then, no one was sticking their
neck out for me, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was enemy number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like you wouldn't even believe way
worse than now said like the fact that one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the Aussie dudes was cool enough to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, cause he was putting faith in me
that I'm not going to be a scumbag and
[SPEAKER_02]: like sandbag him right back for having my
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause a lot of people do that,
you know, like get mad and be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: this person told me you talk crap,
you know, like, and I, yeah, I,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're just solid people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really back in that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so rare to find solid people that
would do anything for someone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got a bit of a cult following down
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like even before all the British syndicate
stuff, I saw a lot of your gear being
[SPEAKER_05]: grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, um, yeah, like Andy, um,
and yeah, and then Kelly outlaw and a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my buddy Southern stars out there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was an early grower of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he is, I gave Wally a couple of
packs of yours recently, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Couple of packs of the blah bar or maybe
the GMO cross as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been getting around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Wally's being so great to me,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy to kick anything back to that guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the legend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, all the, like I said, all those
dudes were just so genuinely different
[SPEAKER_02]: than, than a lot of the Americans that
were on the forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I felt like I had a much different
kinship with them because they were so
[SPEAKER_02]: direct and just, they didn't have time for
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like, nah, mate, get to the,
get to the point, you know, they didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just were, we just understood each
other on that level and were able to
[SPEAKER_02]: communicate much better than I could with
the other Americans.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: More than, more than like seed or anything
from them.
[SPEAKER_05]: The most valuable thing, thousand fold,
not, not you thousand fold, but a thousand
[SPEAKER_05]: fold is the time, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's lovely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just being able to sit there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause yeah, that's what I've always
wanted, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love like, you know, people are a little
bit older and I just get along with them,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I always have since I was a little
kid.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so talking to these kinds of guys that
have been around and hearing all their
[SPEAKER_05]: stories, man, it's invaluable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just thought about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people won't know who we're talking
about when we speak about Wally Duck.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is the creator or I don't even want to
say creator, but he is the man who brought
[SPEAKER_02]: ducks foot that most people like call
things ducks foot traits, but he brought
[SPEAKER_02]: the actual plant ducks foot straight from
the grain cultivar, whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: call it, to the masses and worked with it
and bred with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's how it got into other hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's like a serious, serious legend to
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he's kept a lot of cool shit
alive down under that you'd want to be
[SPEAKER_05]: kept alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like when he had the C5,
so they got a bunch of stuff imported back
[SPEAKER_05]: in the day, a couple of clones that made
it across and he had the C5 and obviously
[SPEAKER_05]: he got Mango Hayes RBL early from Shanty.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was before Shanty canned that
project, which was like 2010 or something,
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got the, yeah, he got the RBL seeds
from him and then started breeding them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got a bunch of them to high and
lonesome this year, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's part of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's killer for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it's like, you know, looking from
across the paddock, cause I haven't been
[SPEAKER_05]: able to grow me up myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's, he's got them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'd be cool to see what he finds in
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And while he's sending me pictures,
he's got some fantastic ones, Neville's
[SPEAKER_05]: Hayes, Z99, Laos Mango fucking C5,
all sorts of cool shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That no, it's really cool and really cool
to hear more about some of the connections
[SPEAKER_04]: as well, historically between the
countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: People definitely probably wouldn't know
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm glad you guys, I wanted to round
out this section on seeds or like genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there anything that any of you wanted
to comment on with regards to the genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: in your regions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions for anyone else?
[SPEAKER_04]: Any of you?
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a question for a gold cut,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: When did they like legalize or start
tolerating the sale of seed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I was there in 2015 and they had him
like over the counter.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how long have they been doing that for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think seeds were sold for 99,
98.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think somewhere around there or even
earlier in, in a, they bought bark seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: from Dutch companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think mostly Positronic and Sensi seeds,
repackaged them and sold them in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: grocery shops and head shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's where they started to sell
them to people who were all regular.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would never have thought it was that
long.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most people like fairly self-reliant,
like they're just growing their own one or
[SPEAKER_05]: two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of people grow, grow for
themselves or for the body is growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: the other guy's growing and they,
you know, swap, swap what they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, like you say, it's like
Homestead, cannabis Homestead.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot, a lot in here, especially with the
taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as soon as the tent growing
started to be just took off, everybody can
[SPEAKER_00]: was capable of, you know, finding space in
a small apartment to grow, grow their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where it took off also with
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you do outdoor where you are like in
Vienna or not?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was gonna ask that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the outdoor climate like?
[SPEAKER_00]: The outdoor climate is like in Oregon,
very similar to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's too wet in September,
end of September, October, it starts to
[SPEAKER_00]: get wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not the best idea to grow long growing,
long flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's barely any outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in all those years, maybe it wasn't my
focus also, but in all those years,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and seeing all types of different
flowers, there was barely any Austrian or
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant Austrian outdoor there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's quite a bit like my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an outdoor culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a growing culture for outdoor
acclimated plants and for their region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd grow a lot of outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I never had that in, especially in
Vienna.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess it's the cities there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's really growing,
sure, but it's not really nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish it would be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I only had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last five years, I only had had
twice really good sun grown Austrian wheat
[SPEAKER_00]: and it blew me completely out of my socks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really good, but very rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bruce, how about what's been growing
outside like for you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Outdoor is my preference, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love growing outdoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just the sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I grow a lot of vegetables and roses,
flowers and stuff like that as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just being out in the sun, having my
hands in the dirt, that's my preference,
[SPEAKER_05]: but obviously legalization and just,
you know, being able to get a lot of work
[SPEAKER_05]: done efficiently.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've switched to indoor just so I can move
through cycles quicker.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have looks at larger populations,
but yeah, outdoor is where I started,
[SPEAKER_05]: man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was in the first sort of seven years of
cultivating.
[SPEAKER_05]: Started in pots, moved to the ground and
man, in ground gardening.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fucking, you know, hit and quit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make a good compost, water it like four
times.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we got good humidity here and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grow trees.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's killer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of like outdoor growing in
Australia in general, do you know much
[SPEAKER_04]: about the different challenges in
different regions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is everyone having a, basically it's like,
is everyone having as good a time as you
[SPEAKER_04]: or?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nah, nah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I live in like, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same before probably one of the more
conducive places on earth to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis outdoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a, you know, not at where Wally
is, but I'm, you know, not down and
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking where you are out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm going to like a more,
I'm higher up more towards the equator.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've got pretty like 14 hours,
maybe 13 and a half hours, daylight and
[SPEAKER_05]: summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, pretty like 12,
12 and winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's super conducive, but like down in
Tasmania, where like guys like Steve
[SPEAKER_05]: Solomon and stuff are, you'll get maybe
one crop a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd probably want to plan early,
maybe even do a depth, but then up like
[SPEAKER_05]: northern, so where they were growing all
that cannabis years ago, you can get three
[SPEAKER_05]: crops a year out up in Maribo or like near
the Northern territory or something like,
[SPEAKER_05]: like that on the table end there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super conducive to growing outdoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say it was like these days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: If people say that a lot of it's done
outdoor, I'd more than assume that most of
[SPEAKER_05]: the cannabis growing probably be indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause a lot of the bulk stuff,
as I was saying, we'd see would always be
[SPEAKER_05]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they're not growing the PGI outdoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're fucking pulling it at like seven
weeks, six weeks indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd say that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like 80% of the cannabis in Australia,
it's grown, it's grown indoors,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is fucked in the head.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you know, we're like a solar panel
of a fucking country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're saying that there's nothing,
well, for, for certain parts of the
[SPEAKER_04]: country, there's nothing, you know,
in terms of the environment anyway,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's like, would be a barrier to growing
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, humidity, like upright, you want to,
yeah, you don't want to grow like big,
[SPEAKER_05]: but like where I am, you want to grow
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always, I prefer sativa shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've always grown like longer flowering
stuff, but yeah, like down south.
[SPEAKER_05]: So where a lot of it's grown like Nimbin
and super wet, Nimbin is a lot more rain,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, rain days than where I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's strange, but it's just where
people congregated man, like around like
[SPEAKER_05]: Byron Bay, Northern rivers, Nimbin,
it was where a lot of the hippie communes
[SPEAKER_05]: were.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then up North, there was like Cedar
Bay, um, and a rainbow something like
[SPEAKER_05]: hippie commune.
[SPEAKER_05]: So where a lot of the hippies congregated
was where a lot of the cannabis was
[SPEAKER_05]: growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it's down south.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got the cold, you got fucking bugs,
mites, you know, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bush turkeys, kangaroos, you know,
when you're growing out in the woods.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, all sorts of pests and just,
that's just the usual stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, not a lot of, you know,
there's nothing, there's not a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: snow, like down south a little snow,
but fucking yeah, you can pretty much grow
[SPEAKER_05]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I thought we could move on to kind of
like rounding this out, but also just like
[SPEAKER_04]: some lighter and maybe more open
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so I guess if we zoom out all the
way, I was curious on us reflecting on
[SPEAKER_04]: like the overall culture of cannabis where
you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just like, I don't know, do you,
you know, are there, are there interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: things that you notice when you think
about people smoking or growing where you
[SPEAKER_04]: are relative to other places?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what's, what's weird about it?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's different, um, from say the U S
which we all, you know, we all know quite
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, is there anything that you would want
to see change, um, as well?
[SPEAKER_04]: Very broad, just like, yeah, super broad
reflections on like, yeah, cannabis where
[SPEAKER_04]: you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone really go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gold coast or gold cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what I would love to change or what,
what I would love to see changing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future here in Austria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be the fact of mixing tobacco
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I also did a lot was
because I was smoking tobacco,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I quit almost 15 years ago,
but it was also part of my smoking routine
[SPEAKER_00]: and habits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's how we smoke in the past
when there was only hashish how we use
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't mix it into a spleen,
but that, that habit lasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still around the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the people I know, uh,
who smoke joints like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish, uh, more awareness would happen
and people would start to, to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to stop smoke that much tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't, if I go out and I meet with a
bunch of people, maybe out of 20 people
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking, there's me and one roster guy who
is not smoking tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, this is a good line of
questioning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything else about how people
consume their cannabis that's weird or
[SPEAKER_04]: like that you think might be weird where
you are?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, tobacco in Europe is obviously a
big one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say that it's still big in New
Zealand, probably still big in Australia
[SPEAKER_04]: as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any other like, uh, nuances or
oddities about how people ingest or
[SPEAKER_04]: consume cannabis where you are?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Example, um, we had an episode on glass,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And American glass a few weeks ago,
and it became really clear to me that
[SPEAKER_04]: different countries are obviously in very
different places when it comes to do with
[SPEAKER_04]: like smoking tech, um, and smoking culture
and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I've become a bit more curious
about like what some of these differences
[SPEAKER_04]: may be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say that people here aren't like
into dabs, at least not much, like not
[SPEAKER_04]: many.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a few, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gold cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, back to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, uh, that, uh, we have an old
tradition or long traditional of bongs of
[SPEAKER_00]: big glass bongs, like the company rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure, you know, so there is something
that is a traditional smoking device here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are the, you call yourself a smoker
here in central Europe in the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: you must have a giant fucking bong.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Giant, but probably really ugly,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: China glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had the money, you would buy a raw.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't have the money,
you buy a China glass, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was no, there was no,
um, there was no heavy glass for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's a bigger and bigger
group, uh, who buy a heavy glass from the
[SPEAKER_00]: States and also European glassblowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what's, what's a bit weird is if
the people stop smoking, or they have the
[SPEAKER_00]: intention to stop consuming, uh,
tobacco with cannabis, they immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: buy a pocket vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that everybody has at
least two in their drawer that don't work
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they buy those da Vinci's and starts
them big and everybody has a pocket
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizer, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, volcanoes, of course,
volcanoes are something that I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: central European smoker uses a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And shillums, which are disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what I mean, big Indian
shillums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, chillums.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the one hitter crack pipe looking
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not big as shillums from India.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fill me the tobacco and the shish mix
and you smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something really nasty that
Europeans, especially Italians do a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what else?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's, what's, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The charcoal filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have to have a big ass bag with charcoal
filters.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you see, is everyone still rolling like
massive?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do people use the rolls like a little tear
off papers still in Switzerland?
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: People be rolling like 20 centimeter,
30 centimeter joints.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like three cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a Dutchman's split.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gross.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bummer, but yeah, that's how I sort
of got addicted to tobacco, I guess,
[SPEAKER_05]: just by smoking that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have friends who never smoked cigarettes
and wait when they started to smoke weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, and mix it with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they started to be addicted to tobacco
with 35 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was dumb as fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like never smoked cigarettes in my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, when I was, I did an exchange in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, um, near Breggen's in Austria.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, yeah, I lived there for like a
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did like a school exchange and yeah,
I didn't smoke much before I went over
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was mostly just bombs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like everyone over here just would get a
plastic bottle, jam a bit of hose into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little like, you know, half inch socket.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then yeah, I saw some gross ones,
man, like, you know, from older friends
[SPEAKER_05]: that'd be, you know, 10 years old and
never changed and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fucked up.
[SPEAKER_05]: All sorts of ammonia and shit coming from
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I got into the spliffs hard and I
didn't even realize like Barry True
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannibalist has talked about this as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I was barely smoking like,
you know, three or four times a month,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe before I started smoking spliffs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it was just, yeah, every day you
just get into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, you get an itching for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's a hard habit to get away
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: People love the effect of a heavy smoke
bombs with tobacco mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't hear people do that, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't do that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to bring this up because
unfortunately for a period of time,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was doing what, and I don't know what
they call it, where you guys are.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's called them like chop, chop.
[SPEAKER_04]: We call it chop or like, yeah,
like CHOP chop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, spin.
[SPEAKER_05]: We call it here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spinning it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because chop's just like chopped up,
bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, we call it spun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And okay, how about things like- Don't be
a bogan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shame when you doesn't vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I asked you the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about a lung booze?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what a lung is?
[SPEAKER_05]: A lungy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like when your friend passes out and
you get a bag on a bong and you like pull
[SPEAKER_05]: it and then blow it in their face.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some overlap.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for us, a lung is like you,
you get like a 1.5 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two liter like coke bottle, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the bottom off.
[SPEAKER_04]: You take a plastic bag to the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: You push the bag all the way in.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a cone piece on the top of the
bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you pull the bag through like out
of the bottle and you have like a four
[SPEAKER_04]: liter like hit, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, and it's like a wish gravity
bong of sorts.
[SPEAKER_05]: This yellow is fucked by the time you get
that lid off the bottom too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all plastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all plastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plastic ain't never hurt no one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like in New Zealand, people doing baka
bongs as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's from my dad's time.
[SPEAKER_05]: My dad was doing ripping baka bongs in the
fucking eighties and seventies and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's weird is we have this thing
called lungers here and it's when you get
[SPEAKER_02]: a two liter bottle, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you cut a whole lot of one side,
but you leave about I'd say two inches of
[SPEAKER_02]: plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you put your dick in it and have
your friends suck it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We call that shit a Tuesday over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm already getting in enough people
telling me about my sexuality in my
[SPEAKER_01]: closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause the other piece of tech that's
infamous of course is the hot knives.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I somehow only the last few
years realized that hot knives are just
[SPEAKER_04]: the precursors to vapes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just like, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's kind of true.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you are vaporizing the weed like
at least partly, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rosinated vaporization techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's like using heat technique and
to make the resin oil.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we often do in clubs or on the goal
was we take a needle and break off a piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it on the needle and heat it up and
smoke it like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it had to be a hashish that wasn't like
super high quality to do that though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you get too high quality,
it would just melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just Moroccan cheap Moroccan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to use my, my hash kettle the
other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I wanted to do a review on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's a beautiful piece and it's like
kind of new thing that this company sells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, they said you need to use hashish
and I didn't really understand what that
[SPEAKER_02]: meant at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got this beautiful, beautiful temple
ball hash from my buddy's spinach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put it in there, go to smoke and it
went just gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was too pure, too nice, you know,
did not serve the purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs more plant material, not only
resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs like legit, like shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was funny though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it was so pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, man, it's dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, while we're on like techniques,
uh, I want to ask both booze and gold cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: How big are dabs and dab rigs where you
are?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, getting bigger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I started, I got into it early.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was lucky enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not lucky, but I found a guy that was
making him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had invested a shitload of money into
like across international gear.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he was making like proper purge oven,
fucking BHA like D waxed, uh, early on
[SPEAKER_05]: like in 2017.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was getting all sorts of dabs from
him and he's mucking around with like
[SPEAKER_05]: diamonds and sauce and shadow and all
sorts of bullshit and rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but in yeah, carts even were around
for a while, but like on the medical
[SPEAKER_05]: scene, you can get, I think water hash,
but, um, yeah, dabs not super big unless
[SPEAKER_05]: you've got to press yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I haven't really seen too many
available.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like on Instagram, I've seen some pens and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've tried one or two that like really
good quality, but for the most part,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, you're just making your own man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like most people will just get a press.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like either one of the cheap, like a lot
of the hydro stores here even sell them
[SPEAKER_05]: like fucking pretty up market ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I think people are just pressing
it more present than, than butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with, with the internet and with
special with internet plugs, everything
[SPEAKER_00]: has changed and also people can on the far
countryside in Austria, they can buy
[SPEAKER_00]: imported, uh, imported rosin, imported,
uh, BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it changed, but it took a very long
time, uh, to, to make people understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that you cannot smoke this black tar that
you extracted out of a plastic pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should probably not dab this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's crackling, that took a very long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, from titanium to quartz,
it also took some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's still very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like you said, uh, the cartridges took
off at a certain point and they are widely
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, um, Instagram and plugs
online changed it completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so widely available.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you, uh, if you're interested,
I'm just kind of like spit balling a bit
[SPEAKER_04]: here, but one other thing that came to
mind that isn't related to, sorry,
[SPEAKER_04]: isn't related to dabs or anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, both Europe and Australia seem to have
a healthy interest in haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that, am I right in saying that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong with America?
[SPEAKER_05]: The PIF that you got Matt passed to you
back in like, whatever, 2015 or 16,
[SPEAKER_05]: whenever it was, was that like,
uh, Tokinaline or what was that like?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, like the frankincense you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 2009.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the frankincense metallic disc.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's better for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was a good, that was really
good unpacking, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of, you know, the state of haze and some
of the reasons why, were there any other,
[SPEAKER_04]: any other questions that y'all had for
anyone else?
[SPEAKER_04]: So with their, their countries or regions,
um, anything else that you observed that
[SPEAKER_04]: you want to provoke or yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask anyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I would like to ask Matthew
because he just talked about PIF and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and Frankie and, uh, how far away are
they from the amnesia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd be curious about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, as far as amnesia haze, the world,
the difference, like as far as what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: used to as, as amnesia haze is like,
you know, the car card we talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the, it's almost floral mercy and
perfume.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and the, it's just so different from
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, um, you'd really have to go to a
Catholic church, a Catholic mass on
[SPEAKER_02]: Christmas and while smell on earth like
it, it would, it would develop that sense
[SPEAKER_02]: memory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything you smell from that point
on, you'd be able to identify PIF like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause then I, I've had anything that
wasn't, you'd be able to go, not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had amnesia that was, I've had
amnesia that was crazy frankincense
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling and tasting almost overpowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never had any like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hyper amnesia that is available in
seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should get you, I should get you a pack
of fresh, send it over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like if it has stuff like that in
it, I want to see it and run it because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the stuff that I think that it
really holds a lot of special eyes when
[SPEAKER_02]: you get real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the main reason here is so still
so popular is because of big yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says a huge fucking yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to see some bonnet amnesia
crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know what, if I could pick,
um, if I could pick Frank, frankincense
[SPEAKER_02]: and mer at like that combination out of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, and you know, if like, I bet if you
could get hit the frankincense zone,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could probably get something very
close to that smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've got a cutting down here that my
buddy found it's from PIF coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's across of Santa Cruz,
Santa Cruz, blue dream across to a PIF S
[SPEAKER_05]: one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he found a lot of like basementy type
stuff in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he found some almost weird like
caramel stuff even, but one that he found
[SPEAKER_05]: that we've kept is like pretty bang on
frankincense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you can pick up like the frankincense
incense sticks, put it next to it and
[SPEAKER_05]: move, you know, four or five of us now
have been like, yep, made that like
[SPEAKER_05]: comparison.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's great smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the smell of PIF though, it's like,
that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just frankincense.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most like you have to have mer with it and
burn it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's like, there's a,
it's not just together.
[SPEAKER_02]: You burn it and you swing it in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, that's what the smell of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a funeral.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd have a funeral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super heavy, super heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives me a damn headache.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: PIF stuff is somewhat interest.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm way more interested in like the A5 and
the C5 and the dog stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like meaning a Hayes resolution in
the States.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see anywhere near as many like
dog shit or Betsy crosses as I'm seeing
[SPEAKER_05]: these days, like CSI, high and low and
some yourself, Matt.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that to Shibud and, um,
and CSI, you know, like they, they really
[SPEAKER_02]: brought my attention to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was mostly interested in old Betsy
because of bull rider.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a, you know, San Diego classic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I was down there, bull rider was
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and Betsy is supposedly the
sister of bull rider.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could see that being very possible
if it, if bull rider is the way people say
[SPEAKER_02]: it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that always interested me because
of that in general and dog shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a classic, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to know what that was like,
but I don't know that any of those are
[SPEAKER_02]: very piffy to me, but that's, that's,
that's the other factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm not mentioning is how everything
is so subjective and how we smell stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't necessarily the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really, really, really like,
I forget daily how important that part is
[SPEAKER_02]: daily in the conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, it's almost like a Renaissance
with the blue dream billionaire right now,
[SPEAKER_05]: too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I've seen fucking like six years
or five years ago on that cutting end too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That cuts been held back for a long time
because so many people threw it away and
[SPEAKER_02]: only like, I mean, I knew like,
one, two people who kept it all these
[SPEAKER_02]: years because like, it was, it was like
kryptonite for everyone for a while,
[SPEAKER_02]: because so many seed lines came out with
that name and were released.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many bad grows of that same cut growing
it commercially and just shit blown it
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nobody really kept it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, yeah, it's, it, it's funny to see
it pop up in a bunch of places other than,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like small places in California,
but there, there is a chance other people
[SPEAKER_02]: did keep that cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it was everywhere for a while at
every collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're coming to the end of the talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a bit, we're almost at the two
hour mark and conscious that for gold cut,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's getting pretty late.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, maybe one of my, one of my final
questions is, are there any, any types,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, quote unquote, broad stroking,
any types of genetics that y'all would
[SPEAKER_04]: like to see more of in your region?
[SPEAKER_04]: Gold cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to anything you can,
you know, that you, you, you think,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, people don't know about,
you know, this broad family or type,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what would I like to see more
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff that we will keep for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relevant, relevant selections or genetics
that have added up balance that not
[SPEAKER_00]: overpowering and not follow necessary
follow the THC percentage hype that
[SPEAKER_00]: Austria also tend, you know, tend to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's, that's, or if that's,
if this answers the question, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a lot more diversity, man,
for the most part, like I'm beginning to
[SPEAKER_05]: see a shift.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a massive fan of a lot of people
leaning into the hype, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: that us hype market is, um, is feeding a
lot of the mines over here as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of people, you know, jumping on
that bandwagon.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, man, you know, we've got a
climate that's conducive to growing
[SPEAKER_05]: equatorial shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's what I want to see a lot
more of the Sativas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what I've been conscious of.
[SPEAKER_05]: We would go out by seeds as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's probably there's a
shitload of Sativa offerings and then
[SPEAKER_05]: we've got like some white Buffalo,
like Nepalese and Jamaican and all this
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a Hazes, you know, I learned
some stuff through Matt and then we've got
[SPEAKER_05]: the GMO bonnet.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a whole bunch of different long
flowering stuff that I'd like to see
[SPEAKER_05]: growing out because, um, yeah,
we've got the climate for it and it's,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a cool smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think people haven't really had
exposure to it that much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of people are geared to
that, that Indica like knock you down
[SPEAKER_05]: mindset, but yeah, there's this whole
other spheres.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, just that man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, just, you know, just compassion,
just people taking that time, thinking
[SPEAKER_05]: through things.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, any, anything else and from any of
you, like any parting thoughts on,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, either your region or anything
that you've heard from anyone else,
[SPEAKER_04]: any questions for anyone else?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty good, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause otherwise, yeah, we can wrap up and
maybe before we do, we just want to make
[SPEAKER_04]: sure that we plug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was where I was going to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I mean, boo, it's like, uh,
you just mentioned a bit about the seed
[SPEAKER_04]: bank and the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I've got go buy seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that basically started, um,
sort of leads into everything that I've
[SPEAKER_05]: been talking about today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I didn't have a lot of exposure to good
genetics until I got into the online scene
[SPEAKER_05]: a bit more and through discord and then
finding out, you know, Matt and crybaby
[SPEAKER_05]: getting their gear and growing it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I just wanted, you know, more people
around me to have access to good gear.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I started go buy seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know, I only stop people that I
really feel that gear, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's on the level, um, that I can vouch
for.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, so we've got a bunch of cool
breeders, you know, that, uh, I've been on
[SPEAKER_05]: this show and some other Aussie guys as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, go buy seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't know, suck my dick,
but yeah, you can find us on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I think it's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just gonna buy, I'm just gonna seeds,
but yeah, just type in go.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll come up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, man, check us out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I'm happy to, to, yeah, just chat
about anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, obviously it's, it's all
souvenir collectibles, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: don't, don't germinate them or nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just put them in the pool room for easy
viewing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, go buy seeds, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just, the biggest thing I want to say
is, yeah, it's an avenue for gear.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really reasonable to be priced for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's really going to be good
quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're not going to be like
wasting your time or your money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, source from ethical people
and yeah, that's it, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, all about trees podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, just a little thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just by starting the seed bank,
I started to chat with a bunch of people
[SPEAKER_05]: and yeah, I wanted to put some of these
long phone conversations into a podcast
[SPEAKER_05]: format.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other people could listen in as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've got two episodes so far,
um, all about trees.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just on sound cloud or on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find us and I've got an episode
with my buddy Eli and another one with
[SPEAKER_05]: sunny from Southern sun seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, Matt and I are going to be doing
one at one point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I've got a couple more lined up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't go into, but yeah, I've got some,
some cool stuff lined up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be really proud of it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, you know, I mean, out of all the
other podcasts that I've listened to,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I was genuinely laughing and smiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only that, like I was like,
God damn, this dude knows his shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dude knows his shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's really, I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, uh, yeah, I'm, I'm proud to have
you talk about it on here because I think
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody that listens to this should give
that a shot and check it out because
[SPEAKER_02]: you're funny as fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, man, just, yeah, just stems
from what everything basically I've
[SPEAKER_05]: learned from you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, I don't want it to be a
regurgitation of your guys show.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my biggest thing where I'm just
like, Oh God, I don't want to fucking,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I mean, you gotta remember
realistically, like a lot of what my,
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk about even is like my conversations
with all of my best friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, so a lot of this information isn't
even just mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, I'm just one of the loudest
people in our group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like everybody's agreed that they're
okay with me doing this, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So even what I'm doing is still a
regurgitation of sorts, and it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily my information to own or any
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, well, a lot of what you guys
talk about is totally different from what
[SPEAKER_02]: we talk about, but it's just as relevant
and special and from an amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective from a good dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and on top of that, the seed bank
part, like all I've ever told anybody,
[SPEAKER_02]: any seed bank, whether it was,
you know, BDSC when they started or any of
[SPEAKER_02]: them, um, was just carry people who are
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll go far.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to carry everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just I promise you, if you carry good
people, it'll be so much less headaches
[SPEAKER_02]: and it'll naturally form its own own base.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you guys are doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, I think that's commendable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the easy route.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the, it's not a moneymaker by any
stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's the most important part
is that it's helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't, it's not hurtful in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not hurtful at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just my way of giving back a little bit to
the scene.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's given me so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and gold cut gold, gold cut also of
course, um, helps distribute Matt's work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we, uh, we are, we are, we are still
still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, there's a bunch of people who
decided to support us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I find amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank every, every person out
there may be listening to us right now who
[SPEAKER_00]: supported Matthew's, uh, uh, introduction
more or less because, uh, here in Austria,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were not known.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think also for the German market
and, or a bunch of people in Central
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe haven't heard about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I decided to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, I think it was a great
opportunity to showcase something that is
[SPEAKER_00]: really different to what is around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, um, we are working on, uh,
getting some of the British syndicate
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff over here because people,
I'm going to send over some of the stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: me and Caleb did, um, with more lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask a lot, you know, people ask for
high and low some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you see there's, there's a bunch of
people in central Europe who listen to the
[SPEAKER_00]: British syndicate podcast and,
um, or, or go to the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, people want to support these
because they, you know, gravitate towards
[SPEAKER_00]: people who think they are like-minded and
ethical background is, I think plays a big
[SPEAKER_00]: role.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I, that's why I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I, you know, like when we
talked, like I couldn't think of anyone
[SPEAKER_02]: else who could better represent everything
that I believe in Europe that I trust as a
[SPEAKER_02]: good heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that's why it's so important for
him to be a part of this with me because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a hard search.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you find someone like that,
you hold them close.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives me, it gives me the chance
to, to also showcase through my work,
[SPEAKER_00]: which continues because I found a new
place to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we continue to, to be available also
as a clone, uh, find something really cool
[SPEAKER_00]: that I like, and I want to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will involve this in my work,
wherever I work and where, or let's put it
[SPEAKER_00]: like this, wherever I think it's,
uh, it's worth to share and where the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality standards are meeting my
expectations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's something I'm,
um, I'm currently working on with a new
[SPEAKER_00]: partner, then a new big facility and an
amazing team, very ambitious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you will hear from that and I
will share some of my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I can involve some also podcast
work, uh, which a lot of people ask me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Hey, don't you, have you ever
thought about sharing some of that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that you do in a new video format?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past and it was old school,
but I think in a new format, maybe,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the, the, the person who owns this
place where I would start to work next
[SPEAKER_00]: month, he wants to do it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants, he wants to do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he wants also a media presence in the
profession and kind of, and I think I will
[SPEAKER_00]: do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's fricking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, like I said, uh,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Citco Europe is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you guys are interested in,
uh, you know, Matthew's work, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the blue bonnet, everything is
available still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a bunch of them are almost sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue bonnet DX1 is sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured, yeah, it goes fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everything else is still, is still
here and is kept well in my fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, if you want, if you're
interested, just call, feel free to
[SPEAKER_00]: contact me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I hope in the future we can,
we can showcase more of, uh, amazing work
[SPEAKER_00]: from the guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's keep it happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it rolling.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you both so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it was definitely quite the project to
coordinate four time zones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so glad everyone showed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was so paranoid that someone I would
either have gotten the times wrong for
[SPEAKER_04]: someone or something would go wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm so, I'm so glad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like messaging everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had like 12 hour intervals, just
checking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a really good time and it was really
nice to hear from both of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think, you know, that's yeah,
it's, it's special to get to talk to
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone who, you know, we all live,
you know, in such different places that it
[SPEAKER_04]: is just cool to have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this and, you know, just try to like,
get a general idea of what everyone's
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing where they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I need to give, I need to give gold
cut is black belt today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to move them to the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll talk about that in a minute when
I end the recording.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
