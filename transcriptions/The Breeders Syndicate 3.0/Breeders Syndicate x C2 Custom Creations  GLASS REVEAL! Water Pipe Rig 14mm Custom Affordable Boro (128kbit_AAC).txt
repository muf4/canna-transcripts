[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_00]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_00]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_00]: seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_00]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The syndicate is a collection of seed
makers that want to push back against all
[SPEAKER_00]: the smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just got in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
C2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Custom creations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is my rip attachment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The normal bowl is actually my favorite
bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a slotted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has a built in filter, super thick and
solid, like I don't worry about breaking
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super solid, but I'm really,
really proud to be working with these guys
[SPEAKER_00]: on the new pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are going to be available soon
for anyone to have at a super affordable
[SPEAKER_00]: price, which was the idea, like my
favorite piece, you know, and being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to offer it at an affordable price to
anyone who's a fan of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in honor of that, we're going to use
the old rip tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't know what I'm
referring to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the heat wand for the rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: My rip master.
[SPEAKER_00]: My old friend, Iri Eyes, told me about
this back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the story goes, we were going to the
Canna Luminati party and he was,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he was flying out to the
party from LA, but Resinlung had to stop
[SPEAKER_00]: by his place and pick up his special bong
and his special wand that he used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, what a yuppie, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had this plan where I was going to
like pretend to break his bong because
[SPEAKER_00]: he's so like in love about it and he
needed to ship it or like have someone
[SPEAKER_00]: pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get to the party and someone
had, I think Denali had outdoor blue
[SPEAKER_00]: bonnet the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to try it with this and it
completely changed my whole point of view
[SPEAKER_00]: on smoking, vaping, flavors, how you can
assess them, all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changed instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm, I don't use it daily,
but when I'm like really, really wanting
[SPEAKER_00]: to figure out like what something really
tastes like, and it really, really assess
[SPEAKER_00]: the high, you can't go wrong with the rip
wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been having trouble sourcing some
of the parts for this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's people working on other
ones, but so far this is my best and the
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is BA.
[SPEAKER_00]: 810 from bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't remember what BA stands for
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Born again, born again.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually has a really good flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was going to be very super
silver hazy, but actually like minky
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells a lot like super silver haze,
like a normal super silver haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: the normal expression that goes around and
cut form out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ma'am, it has a different flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really, really good and unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best I can go is like minty Christmas,
not chocolate, but almost like a
[SPEAKER_00]: peppermint, but not peppermint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep your eye out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make posts when they become available
so you can get your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a good shot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
