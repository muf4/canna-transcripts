[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_03]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Natsodad, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here today with Dr. Daniella
Vergara.
[SPEAKER_04]: She received her bachelor's in
microbiology from Universidad de los
[SPEAKER_04]: Andes, Colombia, 2006, and her PhD in
ecology, evolution, behavior, minor in
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics from Indiana University,
Bloomington, 2009.
[SPEAKER_04]: She is an emerging crop specialist at
Cornell University and a research
[SPEAKER_04]: associate and lecturer at the university
and a postdoc at Colorado in Boulder,
[SPEAKER_04]: starting 2013 in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I started as a postdoc in CU Boulder
in 2013, and then I became a research
[SPEAKER_01]: associate in 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I started researching cannabis in
2013 at CU Boulder.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I reached out to you because going
through looking at a lot of the science
[SPEAKER_04]: that's been done, whether it's by larger
organizations that have worked with
[SPEAKER_04]: breeders and collected DNA and data,
I've noticed that there is a big falling
[SPEAKER_04]: out or maybe a disconnect in communication
between maybe some of the people that are
[SPEAKER_04]: more serious in the traditional cannabis
market versus the academic cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like there's a big disconnect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I reached out to you and I was like,
hey, let's talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that anybody's talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: You seem really super cool and you
actually care.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought, what better way to do it
here and maybe record it for posterity and
[SPEAKER_04]: see if we can get anywhere and what we can
learn from each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you so much for showing up and
sitting down and doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a big show yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, I don't think that there
is a disconnect between the academic world
[SPEAKER_01]: and the science academic cannabis world
and the cannabis world in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that academics are disconnected
from the world, period.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that in general, there is a
disconnect between what happens in
[SPEAKER_01]: academia and what happens in real life and
what real life people get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in general, not just in cannabis,
but overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that you are totally spot on on
what you just said.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the first things we talked about
was how genetics work out what we see,
[SPEAKER_04]: what we don't see.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I figured with our show, I wanted to
define some of these terms that we're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be using and who better to help
me define them than someone that's working
[SPEAKER_04]: with the breeding program at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we talk about phenotypes a lot in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: In generally using the term and the way I
learned the term was phenotypes are like
[SPEAKER_04]: the observable traits, the physical
observable traits and genotypes are the
[SPEAKER_04]: genes that underlie those physical
observable traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we use the term phenotypes,
we are referring to the observable traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so people understand there are genes
underlying those observable traits,
[SPEAKER_04]: which are the actual genotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I pronouncing correctly?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything I'm missing out though?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in general, a phenotype you can
measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a phenotype could be height that you
can measure using a meter stick or weight
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, in cannabis is cannabinoids
that you can measure using an HPLC or a GC
[SPEAKER_01]: machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a phenotype you can measure somehow
with a tool.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And genes need a gene mapping tool of some
sort or measuring tool or sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to you for you to see the letters of
the DNA in order to figure out the gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so in general, the DNA has four
letters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But and those four letters are repeated in
the genome in different, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: different amounts, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can quantify like there's a thing that
you can quantify the number of G's or C's.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's G, C, A and T.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the number of GC's in your in your
genomic content, you can quantify that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, so you need in order to figure
out a gene, you need to sequence that
[SPEAKER_01]: gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many different ways for you to be
able to sequence that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like transcribe the gene in
order to figure out the specific letters
[SPEAKER_01]: of the gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but you can it's a much more
complicated process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I can measure your height
easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you are measuring the height
or the number of leaves or the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: of nodes of a plant, you can do that
fairly easily.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in order for you to take the DNA out,
so you need to do a DNA extraction and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you need to take the DNA extraction
into a facility that sequence it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a much more complex
methodology.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is this what you do at Cornell?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you working at the gene level on the
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, at Cornell, I'm actually part of the
extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm at Cornell Cooperative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm actually working with farmers and
the cannabis industry in general and the
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis at all levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for mostly for for grain and for fiber
and for cannabinoids that are not THC
[SPEAKER_01]: because THC, it's still federally
regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as academic institutions, we cannot
work with high THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do work with other cannabinoids,
which is kind of like a similar thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What you do to enhance CBD, you do to
enhance THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so I do work with with I do go to two
facilities and to work with growers and
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're from Colombia.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the attitude in Colombia like
growing up for a young lady, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: just an average young lady where you grew
up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it was it positive?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it negative when I grew up?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew up during a very violent time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that Colombia has never not had a
violent time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I grew up during the narco time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a very violent time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so that at that time, they were putting
bombs in discos and bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my hometown, Cali, Colombia,
is was the hub of a big cartel cartel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so it was I mean, I remember my teenage
years and very fondly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a lot of fun with friends and I
would go out dancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do remember my parents, my mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom is kind of graphic.
[SPEAKER_01]: With her language, she would say things
like, I don't care if you're with a guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to know where you are,
because if there is a bomb, I want to know
[SPEAKER_01]: where I'm going to pick up the leftovers
of my daughter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's real.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little bit more descriptive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure more descriptive than what I just
said.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were I mean, I do have very
graphic, gruesome memories of what was
[SPEAKER_01]: ongoing in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so that was, you know, I did grow up in
a medium high income household.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad is a university professor.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom is an attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both the retired types now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but I did grow up in a very
intellectual type of family.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still talk politics on the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which coming to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: was weird for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you voting for that person?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like asking questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like not not not in a bad way,
but tell me what is that person offering
[SPEAKER_01]: that I should vote for that person?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So especially talking about elections that
are coming tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's very restrictive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very constrained here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like you have to be because you don't
know who's leaning which way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's especially now the country is
very divided, super divided in Colombia as
[SPEAKER_01]: well, especially with the last president
whom I am kind of proud that that guy got
[SPEAKER_01]: elected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gustavo Petro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not because I think he's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think any politician is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I disagree with 99 percent of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I disagree with the choices I made this
morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the most intolerant person in this
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like five feet two of
intolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but I I do think that Petro offers a
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: He offers something that has never been in
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Colombia has always been an
oligarchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombia has always been a minority that
has ruled the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after particular presidents
before, now the oligarchy is the owner of
[SPEAKER_01]: the.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cocaine exports, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to be honest about it,
that coca is the biggest export in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombia.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the country's main export.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's emeralds and bananas.
[SPEAKER_04]: But realistically, we know where the
majority of the money is coming from.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we cannot just be, you know,
like, yeah, it's it's real.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so with that in mind, you know,
I think that Gustavo Petro comes with
[SPEAKER_01]: like, hey, the war on drugs have not
worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave a speech at the United Nations a
month ago or so that I recommend for
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost cried because he said it out loud
like, hey, this hasn't worked and we need
[SPEAKER_01]: to change things and we need to change
things and we need to try something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we already know that the money
that Americans have given us to stop the
[SPEAKER_01]: coca plantations that that has only
brought violence and it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's try to do something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that we're something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that was really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is now looking to I mean,
medical marijuana has been legalized in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're looking for recreational
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, I think that all drugs,
quote unquote, should be legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we have a clear definition of what
is a drug.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, chocolate is a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's so many things that are drugs
that are intoxicants that could be
[SPEAKER_04]: addicting and that even aren't that aren't
even necessarily affecting our central
[SPEAKER_04]: nervous system that could be addicting in
other ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, so yeah, that's not clearly defined.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think people get that pleasure hit
from all kinds of different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and that could drive all kinds
of factors in their life that could be
[SPEAKER_04]: positive or negative.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really open ended that the way
they've left it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think anybody who's especially
politicians, any any politician that's
[SPEAKER_04]: willing to look at the war on drugs,
the negative effects it's had on everyone,
[SPEAKER_04]: the way it's driven America's like
privatized prisons, everything,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I'm all for anybody pushing for
just total abolishment of illegal like the
[SPEAKER_04]: idea of illegal drugs, the idea of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I think that maybe you and I are
being utopic, you know, like, I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we know that Oregon,
for example, has these laws that they they
[SPEAKER_01]: legalize a bunch of different drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Portugal, right, as a country did as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado right now has in the ballot
psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some places, but I do think that that
asking for for total legalization,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are many big players that are
benefiting from mass incarceration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wars in drugs like the wars in drugs
have been very successful for some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Military contracts galore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you grew up, I assume because it
was like narco wars where you grew up,
[SPEAKER_04]: was the attitude of your parents like more
down on cannabis like you cannot we do not
[SPEAKER_04]: want to see you using cannabis or were
they more open minded on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my parents have always been kind of the
hippies of their families in a way,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though, you know, again, my family
has always been kind of in academia and
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad is a physics professor and I grew
up going to his university studying music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had music lessons there when I was a
child.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've always grown up in a university
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never in my life ever left a
university.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you believe that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just changed, you know, different
university from different places in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombia or in the U.S., but I've always
been on a sort of campus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, to surround yourself with
education like that, though, it's got to
[SPEAKER_04]: be your passion to constantly learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I told you, I am an intolerant
human being and I have my big fights with
[SPEAKER_01]: academia every single day and with
bureaucracy every single day and with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like I have my big fights about
I don't be in the education system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's, again, benefiting a
tiny minority.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that this thing that Biden
is proposing about about student loan,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it should pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that that is just a little
bandaid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better than nothing, but it is not
solving the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that all of these academic
institutions, some more than others,
[SPEAKER_01]: and because I've been in the U.S.,
I've been in three now, I kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, know a little bit about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have academic friends all over,
so I kind of know how they work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these academic institutions are
profiting out of the most vulnerable side
[SPEAKER_01]: of the population, which are, you know,
20 year olds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are benefiting a minority of
administrators who do not care about the
[SPEAKER_01]: education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in general, I feel that professors,
especially those in tenure track
[SPEAKER_01]: positions, are just they're kind of like,
oh, well, you know, what can we do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, I see a lot of that with
tenure, like in any any sort of like
[SPEAKER_04]: teaching profession, whether it's like
elementary school all the way to
[SPEAKER_04]: university.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once they get that, it's just like,
yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got there and you're sitting down.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one can fire you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes an act of God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a good descriptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes an act of God to fire a tenure
track professor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can do despicable things,
you know, like harassment, sexual
[SPEAKER_01]: harassment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're still in this tenure track
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anything can happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to fight for their
students or few of them are going to fight
[SPEAKER_01]: for the students.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I cannot put all of these people in
the same bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, they don't fight for the
students.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't fight for changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't fight for, you know,
more funding towards benefiting their
[SPEAKER_01]: labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just there and no one no one's
going to fire them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a secure pension.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so I that's one of my fights with
academia is kind of like this lethargic
[SPEAKER_01]: state of the tenure track professors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's a lot of people that
are the money and my friends in academia.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one thing that they have the
most trouble with, especially if they're
[SPEAKER_04]: vocal.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a lot of people will take it on
the chin and just try to go with it and
[SPEAKER_04]: try to work within that system.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like my personality, I'm one of those
personalities where, like, I have no
[SPEAKER_04]: filter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just comes out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if I last in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see you're kind of similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wonder how that goes for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so when I was in CU Boulder,
I'm still at CU Boulder as a lecturer and
[SPEAKER_01]: as a researcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I was there, in Colorado,
I was in Colorado for eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was part of the union.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a total union proponent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that in a perfect world,
you shouldn't have unions because people
[SPEAKER_01]: should not need to unionize against.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If people weren't greedy, you wouldn't
need a union.
[SPEAKER_04]: But people are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if there weren't like Elon's and
Jeff's around, exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then then that you should have health care
like you should have to be normal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be a given.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have parental leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because these things are not the norm,
then you should unionize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, so I was part of the
union and I was very vocal about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were some people that did not
like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, like I am a very big
proponent of free speech.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can say whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have the right to not follow you on
Twitter.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the right to tell you,
Matthew, shut up.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you can't say it, but I do have the
right to close my ears.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And adults should be able to like make
that decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that should be an easy decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm a big proponent of the block
feature on all social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes life so much better because like
I don't if someone doesn't like me and
[SPEAKER_04]: they're going to say mean things about me,
I'm not going to sit there and like dwell
[SPEAKER_04]: on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, well, OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I don't have to see it ever again.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to see me.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Life goes on, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can just mute you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is that option for a reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a great option.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but and also because of the cannabis
thing, you know, when I for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've always been a pothead.
[SPEAKER_01]: We moved to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm out of that closet after Women Grow,
you know, after I was in a Women Grow
[SPEAKER_01]: event and I was in the first cohort of
Women Grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when Women Grow started back in 2014
with Jane West and and Julie Baker,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's on has me that yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it completely opened my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was coming from my Ph.D.,
which I was talking nerd to other nerds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went into a completely
different world in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, when I started working in
cannabis, it was a plant that I was going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be studying the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was really interested in the
male and female thing in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was going to start, you know,
like very academic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I get into this industry that for
me was like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an industry, an entire industry
where you have lawyers and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: accountants and you have designers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have every and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: A marketer like first time in my life that
I met a marketer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so it was completely mind
blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and then when I was in this Women Grow
events, I am a biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a field biologist for a long time,
field biologist, rubber boot type of field
[SPEAKER_01]: biologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I got there and I see all of
these women, you know, lipstick and high
[SPEAKER_01]: heels with a joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I you know, I was a hippie kind of
flip flop type of thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: rubber boot with a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you see these women that are
super accomplished, super accomplished
[SPEAKER_01]: economists, finance, financial analysts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, I was I am leaving this
closet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so so yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so the cannabis industry opened my
scientific sphere and my I guess my my
[SPEAKER_01]: professional and personal life company
opened it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you first started smoking,
when did you first start realizing that
[SPEAKER_04]: because I mean, the conversation is
inevitably going to go one place.
[SPEAKER_04]: When did you first start noticing that
maybe like there wasn't there was
[SPEAKER_04]: inconsistency between what you would get
at a dispensary between strains that they
[SPEAKER_04]: would assure you were the same thing,
meaning, you know, a lot of people go into
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: They expect a certain medical effect from
whatever certain strain they buy and they
[SPEAKER_04]: want to rely on that medical effect for
whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: When did you start noticing any kind of
inconsistency or any of that in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that your listeners do not hate
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, they won't.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good people.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: My palate is either yes or no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's usually yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in general, with food,
I am a very good eater.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't eat junk food.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, everything tastes good,
except for maybe cauliflower without
[SPEAKER_01]: cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is the same thing for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I'm high or not high.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are differences between,
oh, this one really made it very cerebral
[SPEAKER_01]: or this one really gave me a couch lock or
this one just, you know, it made me like I
[SPEAKER_01]: am completely doing stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very active.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of anything else,
plus I have a volcano on when you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: volcano and you vaporize it that way,
kind of like the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of that is lost.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really thought that all of that
cannabinoids and terpenes and all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: was just, you know, potheads saying stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a lot of people look at wine or
whatever they called sommeliers
[SPEAKER_01]: sommeliers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought that that was kind of BS
until I analyzed data for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was data that changed my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I started analyzing cannabinoid and
terpenes and the amounts and the
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution and the diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one has one and not the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I was like, oh, this is for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's been multiple studies
throughout the years that just corroborate
[SPEAKER_01]: that I just have a terrible palate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a for real thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you're describing to me is like
with my wife, she smoked when she was
[SPEAKER_04]: young, like a bunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: But she didn't really ever get into like,
oh, I'm going to smoke this strain of
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: She didn't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like she was just getting weed,
whatever, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once we got together, I, you know,
like I'd say, yeah, this is, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: X kind of blueberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this, this and this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's looking at me.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, I smell weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, and it took, and it's
taken until probably the last year to
[SPEAKER_04]: where her palate's finally getting,
oh, I see what you're saying now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, but it takes a long, long time and
constant really getting in into it to
[SPEAKER_04]: develop that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an effort, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now when I go to grows, for example,
I usually, what I do is that I rub the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant with my fingers and then I smell my
finger.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is indeed some that smell like
skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is indeed some that smell like
lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are others that smell more forestry,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's definitely the pine thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you look at the chemotypes
in the studies that I've done,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you see, oh, there is indeed a
terpene called pine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's this other one better
cryophiline and there's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not a lie, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so now, and recently, uh, I got
something that smelled really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really skunky and I was like, Oh man,
this is really skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a skunk that lives around my
house and I smelled it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You finally made the scent connection in
your brain to the smell and everything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so in that sense, but,
but yeah, but in terms of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked, there was one strain that
we could get in Colorado long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was around 20, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2013, 14, 15, which was this tangerine
haste.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know exactly what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had friends in Colorado growing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, I also like edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you like really, do you like the fact
that, I mean, do you like edibles that are
[SPEAKER_04]: super strong and will lay you out for
hours?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you like the ones that are more calm
and not as strong?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always have THC CBD together,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So something that has both, but,
um, I like whatever gives me energy to do
[SPEAKER_01]: house chores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I do not understand how people do
house chores.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they vacuum and sweep and clean a
bathroom while sober?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, you got me on that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm right there with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like to be motivated to do that while
you're sober.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what are you going to do today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to clean the toilet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I need, you know, so I take the
cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then recently a friend of mine gave me
these cookies that have Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this Delta eight, I love it,
you know, and I love the chemistry behind
[SPEAKER_01]: it, the biochemistry, because all of these
compounds, the differences where you have
[SPEAKER_01]: this double bonds, the carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Delta nine, you have the double bond
between two carbons between carbons eight
[SPEAKER_01]: and nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Delta eight, you have the double
bond between carbons seven and eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, I like that kind of like,
okay, why, why is it called this way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides chemistry has always been,
um, difficult subject for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it doesn't come naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I really have to read and so,
um, so that he gave me this Delta eight
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, those Delta eight cookies,
I am super active for three hours and
[SPEAKER_01]: then, or four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just fall asleep and it's like
falling asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be sitting in the table and then I
just, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so, it's so amazing how, how
different like the, the cannabis chemistry
[SPEAKER_04]: affects everyone's different brain
chemistry, like vastly different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it could even be like beginning of the
day, smoking the same exact strain,
[SPEAKER_04]: the same amount, you know, like will make
you feel completely different than at
[SPEAKER_04]: night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's, it's, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's taken me so many years to
understand the variance even between
[SPEAKER_04]: clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that, that's something a lot of
breeders in cannabis, like the past
[SPEAKER_04]: several years, like haven't really even
come to that conclusion or understanding
[SPEAKER_04]: yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'll often have people message me and
be like, Hey, I have this clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought it at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know if this is the old clone
that you and your group remember from,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll say one, I can't identify anything
by pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll be like, why?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And well, because it may grow very
differently in your room than it does in
[SPEAKER_04]: the other room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people don't get how vast that
difference can be.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be, I tried to explain,
uh, with the UK cheese, I've had it turn
[SPEAKER_04]: out super blueberry fruity and look,
you know, a little short and stout all the
[SPEAKER_04]: way to a very lanky, tall, very,
what people would consider typically
[SPEAKER_04]: sativa plant that's foot funk cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the same clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you talk about some of the,
the, the genetic reasons behind that
[SPEAKER_04]: variance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's super interesting that you
mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any physical characteristic,
which a physical characteristic is a
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype, anything that you can measure
somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's a product of genes and the
environment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some physical traits that are
more genetically dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are others that are more
environmentally dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to give you the same two
examples that I always give.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that if people have been in my
talks before, I'm sorry, um, for repeating
[SPEAKER_01]: myself, but human height is highly
genetically a heritable, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your parents are tall, it's likely
that you're going to be tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your parents are short, it's likely
that you're going to be short.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 80% heritability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that 20% is environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that 20% is usually what you ate while
you were growing up, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You had good nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may achieve that potential height,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had poor nutrition, you may not,
but it's 80% genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically there are other traits like
weight, which also has a genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: component.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some people that are more prone
to be, you know, a little bit thicker than
[SPEAKER_01]: other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you eat a particular diet,
you're more prone to have more weight or
[SPEAKER_01]: less weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can control the, the.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more environmental than right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing with these clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing the same clone in a
completely different environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have what you just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have a completely different plant,
particularly because we know that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, for example, is very photo
sensitive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have very good lights,
it's more likely that you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce more cannabinoids and that your
plant is probably going to be happier than
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have fewer lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you put your, your, your plant in
a closet in the basement with no lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably it's going to die.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so that environment is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we don't know is of these
cannabinoids and terpenes, this,
[SPEAKER_01]: this complex, it's a very, very complex
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very complex phenotype that
involves multiple genes acting in unison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this Jordan Sager, who's the
CEO of Dewey scientific in Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a paper with who was his postdoc
advisor, Mark Lange in Washington state in
[SPEAKER_01]: Pullman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have this paper that I really
like where they talk about all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: genes related to cannabinoids and
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we, in biology called epistasis,
which is kind of like two genes acting on
[SPEAKER_01]: a particular phenotype and pleiotropy,
which is two different phenotypes that are
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled one way by one gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have this pleiotropic and this
epistatic effects acting in unison for
[SPEAKER_01]: these very complex phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we don't know how much of it is
environmentally determined and how much of
it is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is, is, is, is genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that there is a genetic component
for sure, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't know how much, we don't know
if it's going to be like weight,
[SPEAKER_01]: or is it going to be like heights in
humans waiting here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the experiments for you to figure that
out are quote unquote, simple,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need to have several generations,
or you can do, for example, the same clone
[SPEAKER_01]: in different environments and then measure
it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but yeah, but, but I agree with what
you, you said to your friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this, is this, you know, blue cheese or
anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it could be.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be, it could be a mother to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be a hybrid of it, or it could be
something that just totally expresses
[SPEAKER_04]: similar and not related to it whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause cannabis is wild and plastic like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has plasticity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing is that we know that
there is a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of genomic diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the genome, all of the conglomerate
of DNA of the plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the letters of the DNA,
we know that it's very diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's three to four times as diverse as
humans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have that amount of diversity,
you can have a lot of diversity in your
[SPEAKER_01]: progeny, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So full sibs may be completely different
to each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, you know, probably this
chem dog number one and chem dog number
[SPEAKER_01]: four, which were probably full sibs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they're completely different
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And reason why it makes sense for you to
clone the plants, because when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: cloning them, then you're assuring that
they're going to be more similar to the
[SPEAKER_01]: mother plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Than if you have seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's why I think that we need really
good breeding in cannabis, in marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in hemp, it's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, cannabis is hemp and
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in hemp, it's happening for grain and
for fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Europe has done some good job at
breeding and China as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for marijuana, I think that we need to
have good breeding and good breeding for
[SPEAKER_01]: particular locations, because especially
if you're growing outdoors, because Amble
[SPEAKER_01]: County, California has a very different
environment than upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing outdoors,
I think that you need to have really good
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that that happens in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that it is happening.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's it's been happening for years,
but the ratio of people doing that kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: work to the people just putting something
on the market to make money is it's very
[SPEAKER_04]: low.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the amount of people like doing
serious breeding work versus I'm going to
[SPEAKER_04]: cross this to this and see what happens
because the names are cool, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and putting it out on the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of that now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's typically what we see in the
breeding market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there are very reputable
companies in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know one company from Colorado,
Trilogy, and Seeds, I think that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: they're good at what they do, for example,
as breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is time consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do agree with you that the naming
thing is what we know that the naming
[SPEAKER_01]: convention is is just BS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that sativa, indica, hybrid,
they do not mean much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when you're trying to group
traits like this is sativa because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: lengthy and tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it has high THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like those traits are completely
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like me saying like, oh, you are tall
because you have brown eyes like that is
[SPEAKER_01]: not related whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a dog is tall because it's white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that doesn't have any sort of
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, we know, for example,
that there are strains that have nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: to do with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Girl Scout cookies, for example,
Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have two strains, Girl Scout
cookies that are more closely related to
[SPEAKER_01]: something completely different except to
each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when people ask me for my
recommendation, what I tell them is,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you name this, I don't know,
blue dream, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You name this blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then and they got, I don't know,
a cannabis high times cop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then rename it next time and just call it,
I don't know, dream blue.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's typically how it goes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rename it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or then, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or then just this blue dream got whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then name another strain blue dream as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like no one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, and then when people tell me like,
well, but mine is the real blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you whether your blue dream is
related to other blue dreams, but I cannot
[SPEAKER_01]: say who's the real one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like which one is the real OG?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: See.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, that's what's like the most
fascinating part of the topic to me is,
[SPEAKER_04]: is what we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend, Matt pointed out to me,
he's like, it's anthropology, Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, cause I was trying to explain to
him, like, how do I explain to a scientist
[SPEAKER_04]: what we do and why what we do is reliable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most importantly, cause like anybody can
say like, yeah, I got this cut and yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's real.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I said, it's real or it's real
because this guy told me and he's old,
[SPEAKER_04]: like these are not good.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is anthropology to it in the
sense that, uh, you know, there are people
[SPEAKER_04]: that have been alive and in this,
in the scene for X amount of years and
[SPEAKER_04]: were there when this strain first popped
up, watch where it came from already were
[SPEAKER_04]: that kind of person that would record that
kind of data, you know, and there are
[SPEAKER_04]: these guys in the cannabis world that
exist and have existed like total nerds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are these people that exist in
the cannabis world that are kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: reclusive.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's very, it's been a task.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's what I've devoted my life to
is figuring out who these people are,
[SPEAKER_04]: where they're at.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I can shake down their story and,
and really figure out, is this one,
[SPEAKER_04]: is this provable?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it plausible, probable or total BS?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause there's four answers you can get
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of them are right in between two
and three, you know, there's very little
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff that we can be like, okay,
we know this came from, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, Dave Watson.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know skunk one came from Dave Watson,
1975, roughly, you know, we know that for
[SPEAKER_04]: a fact because it was well documented at
the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was in books at the time, multiple
different sources.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's still around, can still give,
you know, statements that are all
[SPEAKER_04]: contemporaneous with what was going on at
the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: The story hasn't changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, however, then we have stories like
purple oracle where we have nine to 10
[SPEAKER_04]: different claimants.
[SPEAKER_04]: None of them can show that they had any
kind of parental progeny or documentation
[SPEAKER_04]: on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's one of those stories that sits,
but oddly enough with things like Goji
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush, we can, we have pretty good
documentation of certain strains like that
[SPEAKER_04]: because enough people were around.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't so long ago that a lot of people
that were around then are still around,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, but it's debatable regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it would be super cool to
be able to do some genetic study that may
[SPEAKER_01]: corroborate all of these stories,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the most important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, I, I think that that could be
super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I would be a little hesitant because I
have gotten a lot of sometimes,
[SPEAKER_01]: not a lot of, no, some negative vibes from
certain people about genomics work and
[SPEAKER_01]: about, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these tools that are super powerful
and that are going to change the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that part I feel, you know,
like saying kind of like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is really not blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be someone that's not going to
like it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard a lot of feelings in this
industry that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you heard a lot of feelings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that it would be a really cool,
um, genetic study that corroborates this
[SPEAKER_01]: anthropological study, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've done that with dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done that with humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, we know for example,
that dogs were domesticated multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: times, uh, by multiple cultures.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is pretty crazy, but we also had
anthropological evidence that the Chinese,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, had dogs and that,
um, there were also dogs in, in Europe and
[SPEAKER_01]: in America, in the Americas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so we know that dogs were domesticated
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know, for example, in humans,
one really cool study that I remember
[SPEAKER_01]: coming up, you know, we know that when
Christopher Columbus came to, to America,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, they basically, um, the Spanish were
different from the British, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The British kind of sent colonies in,
in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Spanish just took all of the gold and
left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they were not planning on really
staying in South America, but they did,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, rape women, men, and then took
the gold and left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we have some evidence,
genetic evidence that many of the genes
[SPEAKER_01]: that are coming from men are from Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of the genes that are from women
are from native women in South America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was this beautiful study that
was published in PNAS.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say that it was probably
around 2011 or 2012 that took what we knew
[SPEAKER_01]: anthropologically and had this genetic
study.
[SPEAKER_01]: About the human mitochondria that is
inherited through the mother and the Y
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosome that is inherited through the
father.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was so beautiful to see,
you know, the parallels between genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, genomics and anthropology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that in cannabis could be
similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess that's how you make
anthropology scientific, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is, is you back up the data or you back it
up with data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, yeah, I know there was,
we had talked about this about 10 years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago, we were going to start doing it just
specifically with the OG Kush project.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the problem was one, of course,
you have to source all of these cuts
[SPEAKER_04]: specifically from the most reliable
sources and the most reliable sources in
[SPEAKER_04]: quotes, because that's, it's only going to
be what people tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you get enough of them,
you can kind of get an idea, a very good
[SPEAKER_04]: idea, especially when, you know,
multiple people confirm certain sources.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were going to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, we didn't know of
any reliable place, except there was one
[SPEAKER_04]: company at the time called Philos to even
do the testing to tell us the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the, the matrilineal, patrilineal
relations, any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they, any OG that was submitted to
them, they all said was the same clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were not able to tell when it was
obvious, like when someone was like giving
[SPEAKER_04]: a known self line, like saying,
I popped the seed from a known self line
[SPEAKER_04]: from this clone, I'll send you a clone of
this and a clone of this, sent it to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was showing up as the exact same
clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we already knew it wasn't going to be
reliable from the jump, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so Philos, they do have that galaxy,
which is trustworthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that they have done a good job at
the galaxy and they have all of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the pushes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so their, their galaxy, I know the
tests behind the algorithms behind that
[SPEAKER_01]: galaxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cool thing is that you can shift
it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can kind of zoom into a particular
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I disagree or, I don't know what are
they doing right now regarding their
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencing, but I disagree with particular
ways of sequencing the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's other ways of
sequencing where you can get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: information and you can also explore other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have multiple individuals,
multiple coaches that are, that may not be
[SPEAKER_01]: related to each other and they are all
appearing as the same clone, I would be
[SPEAKER_01]: hesitant about those results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it may be the way that
they're sequencing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so there are, for example,
for paternity tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to figure out whether that is your
child or not, there are particular genomic
[SPEAKER_01]: regions that you sequence and not other
genomic regions, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You sequence genomic regions that are very
varied between individuals because there
[SPEAKER_01]: are genes that are extremely conserved
between you and I that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're Mexican and Colombian, they may not
differ.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but there are reliable paternity
tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to figure out which region of
the genome you're sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there could have been a
problem with phylos doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in a hypothetical situation,
I'll say it that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we were taking a, a clone mom,
like let's for the, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll call this Sendo Sterps and a,
a Lubbacush, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were taking that mother clone and
the other mother clone, submitting those
[SPEAKER_04]: to phylos.
[SPEAKER_04]: We crossed them together, ran the progeny.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that one, I mean, the progeny is
all either Lubbacush or Mendoperps or a
[SPEAKER_04]: variance of, it's very reliable and
breeding, sent them a clone of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And none of them showed related at all
between all three.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's when we were like, okay,
so we have the OG Cush data.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some pretty known data when it
comes to cookies on cookies parentage and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not showing up in phylos data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we did that to kind of test and
see how hypothetically we did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Allegedly that was done to see how,
if, if it would really show up like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in one case there was like Chem 91 and
Chem 91 S1's self line sent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were able to tell this as a self
version of that or really close relation
[SPEAKER_04]: to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in many cases, they couldn't tell
direct relations from each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was, there was no consistency.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like sometimes it was right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes it was just so off.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really confusing to me and I never
knew why.
[SPEAKER_04]: It never made any sense to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I don't understand the science
behind how they collect the data where the
[SPEAKER_04]: error would have been, but it's always
fascinated me to no end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to explain something to you,
which I think could, could be,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's for sure,
but it could be one of the reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you are sequencing a genome,
right, you have all of the letters of the
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's multiple ways of sequencing the
genome, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one way that is called whole
genome shotgun, where you take the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: genome and you sequence it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're sequencing whole genome
shotgun, there's something that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: called the coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the coverage is the amount of times
that on average, each letter of the DNA is
[SPEAKER_01]: being sequenced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on average, if you have one X on
average, each letter is sequenced one
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have 10 X on average, each letter
is sequenced 10 times.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a hundred X on average,
each letter is sequenced a hundred times,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really like whole genome shotgun,
even if it's one X, because you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire genome and you can look at
different regions of the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, it is cheaper
per letter to sequence the entire genome
[SPEAKER_01]: at a whole genome shotgun.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is another way of sequencing the
genome, which is called genotyping by
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencing, GBS.
[SPEAKER_01]: In GBS, what you do is that you take the
genome and then you break it down into
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces with these enzymes, these proteins
that are kind of like these little
[SPEAKER_01]: scissors that you break the genome into
pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you end up sequencing only 1% of
the genome, approximately 2% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: GBS helps you to figure out whether you're
more closely related to me or whether
[SPEAKER_01]: you're more closely related to your mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is GBS.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, GBS has a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the problem is repetition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if you do it with the same
restriction enzymes, the same pair of
[SPEAKER_01]: scissors, and even if you follow the same
protocol, repetition is not consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a paper showing that the
repetition in GBS is not consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in addition to that, even though it's
cheaper because you're only sequencing 1%,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's cheaper in general per letter,
it is not cheaper than whole genome
[SPEAKER_01]: shotgun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are different pairs of scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different restriction enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have this study in 2016 that we
compared the GBS data from one group to
[SPEAKER_01]: another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because they had used different
restriction enzymes, we could not compare
[SPEAKER_01]: the data between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could just compare it to the whole
genome shotgun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one against the whole genome
shotgun, this one against the whole genome
[SPEAKER_01]: shotgun, but we couldn't compare these
two.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there were no overlaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is my understanding that phylo
sequences GBS.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they still do,
but at least at some point in their lives
[SPEAKER_01]: they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always questioning that reasoning,
whether it's for profits because you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to spend more money or because the
questions that you have, you just need to
[SPEAKER_01]: know whether you're more closely related
to your mom than to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you cannot look at the repetitive
content of the genome, the junk DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot look at whole genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot look whether these entire genes
have different copies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I question GBS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that may be one of the
reasons why they got those results with
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not be surprised with GBS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially, I am really sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bump things in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a hair somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the type of person that is trying to
look neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have toothpaste.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never been good at doing something
more than DNA extractions.
[SPEAKER_01]: My DNA extractions are fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have to do something like GBS
where you have to sonicate and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to do the restriction enzyme and then
you have to do this other, that wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you need to have a really good
technician, even then, your results are
[SPEAKER_01]: not repeatable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they're not repeatable,
isn't that what science is?
[SPEAKER_04]: To be able to show something is
repeatable, to have repeatable results,
[SPEAKER_04]: to make a valid... I mean, I'm a layman.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm good at English and history and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I'm wrong, correct me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that also makes me think, okay,
so if that data is incorrect with just
[SPEAKER_04]: those very few examples that we noticed,
and we're one out of tens of thousands of
[SPEAKER_04]: people who use this, when they go to
cell-set data, if it doesn't merge well
[SPEAKER_04]: with other people's data sets,
said data might end up worthless.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all that investment and savings that
they went to be cheaper to save,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever, if that was the theory in it,
would end up not working out so well,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it just... From my point of view,
as someone who's like a history and not a
[SPEAKER_04]: math person or a science person,
it doesn't make much sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I 100% agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, people in the world,
I'm gonna say something that, look,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know that there's a lot of science that
it's not repeatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, Excel spreadsheets,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that Excel spreadsheets,
when you type one, whatever, it translates
[SPEAKER_01]: it to January 12th.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's thinking, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that we know that Excel screws things
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also know that there's other
science, old science, that may not be
[SPEAKER_01]: repeatable right now, that at that time,
so similar to GBS, I think that GBS,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's gonna be a few years until people
stop using it for these reasons and for
[SPEAKER_01]: other reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's other techniques, enzymatic
techniques, that people do not use
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used allotimes during my PhD that no one
uses that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to give you another example,
studies with mice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found out, we in the world,
I mean, we found out that mice respond
[SPEAKER_01]: differently to humans, whether it's a
female that is treating the mice or
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's a male that's treating the
mice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So results with experimental mice may
differ whether the person conducting that
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment was a woman or a man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it like scent hormone or do they know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know that there is this gap in
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that there's a lot of data sets
that are not publicly available,
[SPEAKER_01]: including some from my papers,
one paper because of some reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I try to make my data available
because I think it's fair with the world
[SPEAKER_01]: and particularly because I don't know
what's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know whether my analysis was
entirely correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know whether you analyze it
differently and are gonna get a different
[SPEAKER_01]: result or right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that I should make all of my
data public for anyone here or in
[SPEAKER_01]: Patagonia, Argentina or in Shanghai,
China to be able to analyze my data and
[SPEAKER_01]: tell me, hey, I did get what you or I
disagree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that in many cases,
that's not the way with science,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not the way with Excel
spreadsheets, that's not the way with...
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that with GBS data,
whenever I see GBS data, I'm not analyzing
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's funny is because Phylos was
embedded in our subculture for so long.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was like a good, I don't know,
eight years that people were taking their
[SPEAKER_04]: data and making conclusions from it and
making other conclusions from it based on
[SPEAKER_04]: those conclusions that Phylos had made.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we kind of realized how bad or
inconsistent some of the data was,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was like slowly unraveling stuff in our
head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we always used to make these
conclusions based on that data,
[SPEAKER_04]: but that's now invalid data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you actually have to go through and
like remove it from your brain,
[SPEAKER_04]: scrub your brain from all these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now when I see people with Phylos data,
I'm like, I don't want to see it because
[SPEAKER_04]: it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it might be right, but it might
not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's an unreliable narrator.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's some things that are
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the relationship between
strings may be right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that they're doing breeding,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when all that blew up and a lot
of people's anger at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me, I was just more interested in
like, are you putting out good data or bad
[SPEAKER_04]: data?
[SPEAKER_04]: But people were purchasing data.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care what you do with any of your
breeding or any of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Until they started asking for whole seeds
and stuff like that, that's when it became
[SPEAKER_04]: different.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when it came to the data, is this data
consistent with what we're seeing?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when we start finding out it's
not, well, then what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily, I think they no longer do data
sequencing and they're just doing their
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding program now, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Props to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they have good luck with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the other things in cannabis that
we ran into over the years that we've been
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to figure out is in cannabis sex
reversal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ethylene plays a major role, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times we're seeing a clone,
like take a clone, take 60 cuts off a
[SPEAKER_04]: single mom.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll be in a tray, 10 inch by 20 inch
tray, 50 of them next to each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll get 30% distribution that actually
reversed really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: 30% that kind of do, and 30% that won't at
all, or it'll reverse and won't drop
[SPEAKER_04]: viable pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And none of us know why.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this has been going on for decades and
none of us can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm interested to hear your take on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to, okay, I'm going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that cannabis has X and Y
chromosomes, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are an XX, you're a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're an XY, you're a male,
kind of like us, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have the Monitius,
which people in the industry call the
[SPEAKER_01]: Hermes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's call it Hermes, although they're
actually Monitius.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Hermes, we know that there are
particular regions of the chromosomes that
[SPEAKER_01]: are very similar to the female
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we don't know exactly how
different the Monitius chromosomes are
[SPEAKER_01]: from those of the female chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know that entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that the Y chromosome in the
males, it's very big, is the biggest of
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're sequencing a genome,
there's something that is called the
[SPEAKER_01]: genome assembly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an assembly is when you're sequencing
the genome and you have to partition those
[SPEAKER_01]: regions into pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to put them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when coverage comes really handy
because if you have something that is more
[SPEAKER_01]: than one X, so if you have something that
is, let's say, 100 X, then it's easier for
[SPEAKER_01]: you to put the puzzles together because
then you have this piece, this piece,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you have this other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, you're starting to put
your puzzle together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ideally, you would have in cannabis,
you would have 11 pieces, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it has nine autosomes,
so nine chromosomes that are not related
[SPEAKER_01]: to sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have an X and then you have a Y,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have 11 different pieces that is
your complete puzzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a really good assembly that was
produced by Chris Grasa and Chris Grasa et
[SPEAKER_01]: al.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2021, which is a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we do not have the puzzle for the
Y chromosome or the puzzle for the
[SPEAKER_01]: Monitius chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know that if you have a Y
chromosome, you're very likely to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have two X chromosomes,
you're very likely to produce female
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some varieties, as you said,
that if you put ethylene or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: silver nitrate, whatever, they start
producing flowers from the opposite sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: In males, if you put ethofen, right,
you start producing flowers, female
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some strains that are more prone
than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know which are the genes that are
turning on, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that those genes may not be
related to the X and the Y chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that those genes may be somewhere
else in the genome.
Interesting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you have the X and the Y
chromosome, you still express,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whatever sex it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have XY, you're male.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have XX, you're female.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then if you force them to produce the
other sex, there's some that produce them
[SPEAKER_01]: and some not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe these genes are found somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have some idea of some genes that
are turned on and turned off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that is a really
interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why, when, how do you turn these genes on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just that some individuals do not
have them?
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, even if they're clones of
each other in the same tray, one inch
[SPEAKER_04]: apart, meaning the angles of light are
very similar, like how they're being fed
[SPEAKER_04]: is identical.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see 30 percent in a random
distribution, not like in one set next to
[SPEAKER_04]: each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll be totally random.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it blows my mind every time that we
just can't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just cannot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to explore that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what really caught my attention
in cannabis was that sex part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've never so far worked, you know,
I worked in the cannabinoid genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the beginning, when I started
working in the cannabinoid genes,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was like, oh, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I love them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely love them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but that part of the sex is super
interesting to me because the white
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosome, you know, the white chromosome
in humans is very, very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tiny.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it basically has, you know,
very few genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's one gene that says,
hey, everyone, wake up, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: express.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I have many of the genes
that you have to produce beer,
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce all of the hormones that men
produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't have that gene that wakes
everyone up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the white chromosome is tiny,
basically has that one gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In cannabis, on the other hand,
the white chromosome is humongous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the reasons why I think that we
do not have a proper assembly is because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so big and it's full.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got so many white elements that
are just Ellin and Leroy, Leroy,
so many of them, so many of them.
And it's so complex that it's so difficult
to put together the white chromosome with
[SPEAKER_01]: repetitive elements, junk DNA and the
repetitive elements are repetitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have repetition, repetition,
repetition.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so difficult to put together because
it's repetitive and repetitive and
[SPEAKER_01]: repetitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very hard to know when it ends and
when it starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we don't know what's going on in
that front.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one thing that's driven me for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We developed a spray that is a
ready-to-mix spray for people that's
[SPEAKER_04]: silver nitrate, sodium thiosulfate-based.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the one thing that me and a few other
people that are making feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: longer than anyone else in the US,
we've just never been able to figure out
[SPEAKER_04]: that one factor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you sell the spray, people are
always like, well, how do we know for
[SPEAKER_04]: sure?
[SPEAKER_04]: And to tell them, I don't know,
just numbers, bet on numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always use high amounts of numbers because
odds are in your favor eventually if you
[SPEAKER_04]: use enough numbers that you'll have
successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the one thing I've learned too,
when I did a population of, there was
[SPEAKER_04]: 16,000 plants, 3,000 of which I reversed,
and it was hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I noticed with hemp is unlike
high THC cannabis, it reversed
[SPEAKER_04]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually there's like the staggered in
cannabis, high THC cannabis, where it
[SPEAKER_04]: takes two and a half weeks to then show
their sex as being a male, completely
[SPEAKER_04]: reversed.
[SPEAKER_04]: In hemp, it was like that, and they were
ready to drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it, hemp for fiber or grain?
[SPEAKER_04]: This was hemp, it was Remedy Hemp Kush
Cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was more for CBD production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was high C.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it triggered immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in that population of 16, or I'm
sorry, 3,000 that were reversed,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was probably three that didn't
reverse at all, stayed totally female no
[SPEAKER_04]: matter how much they were sprayed with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd never seen that in high THC
cannabis, but I'd never ran that many
[SPEAKER_04]: plants in high THC cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was really interesting to see stuff
like that in sexual reversals,
[SPEAKER_04]: that there were even plants that were
totally resistant to that kind of spray in
[SPEAKER_04]: sex reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it took seeing a large
population to even be able to see three,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to do experiments with that
and see what is going on in the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: What genes are you turning on?
[SPEAKER_01]: What genes are you turning off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's super interesting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ever want to work on anything,
I am more than happy to send you whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: you need.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're always doing all kinds of
experiments, using all kinds of different
[SPEAKER_04]: ethylene blockers and all kinds of
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that you should quantify those
things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that numbers are so
powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of these 16,000, there were,
I don't know, 11,000, and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: quantify.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you do it again in,
I don't know, 2025, then you do it again
[SPEAKER_01]: and you quantify.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have numbers like what is the
ratio?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the odds?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you sell your product,
you can say like, hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it works for 30% of the individuals when
you have 1,600.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should do it when you have more than
five, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll find that a lot of like cannabis
breeders that have been doing it a long
[SPEAKER_04]: time, they all fall on the autism
spectrum, hardcore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of them refuse to keep data
written down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all up here because they've lived
with that idea that like if I get caught
[SPEAKER_04]: with any kind of numbers or data,
I'm going to get busted and they're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to use it against me in a court of law.
[SPEAKER_04]: So almost everyone keeps every bit of data
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not that great at keeping data stored.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like my memory is not that great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But some of my friends, I'm like,
how do you remember like 25 years of data?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just magically do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, nothing's better than hard
written data with, you know, that you can
[SPEAKER_04]: compare and refer back to.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, this is what you refer to
as, you know, something that probably
[SPEAKER_04]: people think is the most controversial
topic that you're that you like talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about is GMO science and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to talk about the future of
cannabis and where you think it's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: go from here and where we can go.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some of the beautiful things that
GMO science can bring to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a non-for-profit organization,
the Agricultural Genomics Foundation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the aim of that non-for-profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that I someday can fulfill that
goal is to develop genetic tools for the
[SPEAKER_01]: use of the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: These genetic tools include GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: So GMOs is genetically modified organism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What classify as a GMO or not,
that's very debatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, you know, if you can,
if you need to be in a lab space for you
[SPEAKER_01]: to put the gene or take it out or express
whatever, then it's probably a GMO,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that GMOs are very important tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have GMOs everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: These big strawberries in the supermarket.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're polyploid.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not existing naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was humans that somehow made that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, artificial selection is
being done by humans, but there are a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of GMOs in many things that we eat,
in rice, in a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think GMOs could be super useful for
cannabis, for marijuana, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: to enhance maybe the production of
cannabinoids in hemp to silence certain
[SPEAKER_01]: genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't want THC, then it could help.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's been a big problem for a lot of
hemp producers is testing hot.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Testing hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially if you're growing for
fiber, for grain, why do you care about
[SPEAKER_01]: THC?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, why have to put energy into it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes some of these varieties for
grain or fiber go over 0.3.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have, I don't know, 0.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who cares if a grain variety has 0.8?
[SPEAKER_01]: The farmer, because now he's in,
he or she are in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's serious at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that, for example,
in the specs determination stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that would be important to
know exactly whether or not you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce flowers of the opposite sex
because sometimes your plants just come
[SPEAKER_01]: out and you then have seeds and it's like,
who was the hermit here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that GMOs could be useful for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for hemp, for fiber and for grain as
well to produce bigger grain or to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that maybe this is resistant to
particular diseases right now with a
[SPEAKER_01]: changing environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Due to the climate crisis, I think that
those techniques are going to come very
[SPEAKER_01]: handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in general, I see a very bright future
in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue for me, these tools are
happening in every single crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue for me is who owns those tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is able to access those tools and
whether the access of those tools is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to benefit the public, the grower,
the consumer, or if it's going to benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: a corporation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's super important,
the politics of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is my issue with those tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hence why I have the nonprofit
organization, which at some point I hope
[SPEAKER_01]: that I can grow enough for, I mean,
I don't know if it's going to be a big
[SPEAKER_01]: enough non-for-profit to combat,
you know, big corporate corporations in
[SPEAKER_01]: big ag or big tobacco or big pharma,
but maybe we can help the public somehow.
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of funding would we need in
order to be able to make any kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: difference in being able to use this
technology for people that it could
[SPEAKER_04]: benefit that maybe aren't rich?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because I know this technology is
expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the prohibitive factors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And why you would have to establish a
nonprofit in order to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of funding would we need?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Elon Musk type funding or,
you know, is it a few million?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, many of these companies,
many of these companies in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: space, you know, like the phylos type
companies, medicinal genomics type
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, they have raised in the
millions, like four, five, six,
[SPEAKER_01]: max 10, less than 10, seven, eight million
dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that for us at AGF, Agricultural
Genomics Foundation is a non-for-profit
[SPEAKER_01]: that I run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am looking for a few thousand dollars to
start public awareness and public
[SPEAKER_01]: education and to teach people really how
what is a genome?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you how do you do these tools?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for that, you know, a few hundred
thousand dollars could go a long way or a
[SPEAKER_01]: few thousand dollars, you know,
less than a hundred thousand dollars,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a few thousand dollars could go a
long way on teaching people how to use
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that everyone is going to become a
genomicist or a bioinformatician,
[SPEAKER_01]: but how to be educated about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're trying to do now is
figuring out how to raise that funding to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to start growing this and to start
educating the public and and and making
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these tools and then being able to
to get this running, basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how far out do you think we are from,
say, turning on turning on or off the gene
[SPEAKER_04]: that is responsible for like, let's let's
say HPLV, something like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: a viroid that's that's a ravaging cannabis
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: How how far out would we be from being
able to combat something like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: GMO speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the hop late environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it really bad in California?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's bad everywhere because of the
nurseries and how how hype strains kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: were pushed in and there were demands for
specific strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: It spread like wildfire, wildfire.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in Spain now, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, we don't have that as much in New
York State.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: New York State is not one of the big,
big hubs of of growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going with nurseries and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: California, Oregon, Colorado, Washington,
Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Amsterdam's been ravaged recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Belgium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's all over now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long are we going to take?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is this is it's just because this
is evolves to rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see it in covid and then we have
the Delta and then we have the Omicron and
[SPEAKER_01]: then we have rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's also changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's it's also you are changing
and the virus is changing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that one is hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would recommend in that case is
have a good tissue culture facility where
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do tissue culture and you can
assure that your stock is clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is is hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that breeding is is another good
thing when you have actual males and
[SPEAKER_01]: females that you're breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yes, again, you have to do the
female hunting and then it takes several
[SPEAKER_01]: generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have two siblings that are
nothing alike.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to grow however many
hundreds of thousands of seeds to look for
[SPEAKER_01]: that one that is the one that you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you go and as you're doing
inbreeding, right, parents and offspring
[SPEAKER_01]: or full steps, then you get better traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but in terms of of disease,
I think that the best thing that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: have is diversity is as much variation as
possible, because then if you have full
[SPEAKER_01]: sibs, maybe these two are affected by the
virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe these two are not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that regarding disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's other traits that I think an
albinoids, maybe terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other traits that I know that
people are looking at flowering time
[SPEAKER_01]: genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That that we may have genetic tools
available sooner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that would that would be so cool
because, you know, I mean, flowering time
[SPEAKER_04]: is a serious determiner of probably as
best we can tell high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's certain highs that you can
get from an 18 week flowering plant from
[SPEAKER_04]: Colombia that you can't get from a eight
week flowering plants from Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to see that that played with a
bunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything else in breeding in
cannabis that has totally blown your mind
[SPEAKER_04]: that you found like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was quite unexpected once you started
looking at the genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was quite unexpected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the cannabinoid genes, it was,
you know, it's so cool because at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning we thought that it was one gene
with two different alleles, like with two
[SPEAKER_01]: different forms of a gene.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that if you were dominant for one,
then you produce CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were dominant for the other one,
then you produce THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you were heterozygous,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were homozygous, you produce THC
homozygous for the other allele,
[SPEAKER_01]: you produce CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you were heterozygous,
then you produce both.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we found out that there are
multiple genes related to cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: production, multiple, and that individuals
differ in the number of genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we found that out, I remember I
remember the day that we found this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was doing the genome alignments and
I was looking at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my lab mate at the time,
who's now a good friend and collaborator,
[SPEAKER_01]: Kyle, he was the one that was like,
this doesn't look right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at these alignments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we found out that they were
actually different genes and there were
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple genes that were very similar to
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we found out that, yes,
indeed, there are different copies,
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals differ in these different
copies, but these genes are in close
[SPEAKER_01]: proximity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm working on this paper that I
hope to have published by 2023 that we now
[SPEAKER_01]: see that there are multiple genes,
for example, for CBC production,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a bunch of genes related to CBC
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is CBC produced in such little
quantities?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's so many genes related to CBC
production, like that is a question that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: And my hypothesis is that, you know,
like these enzymes, we know that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They act on the same precursor molecule,
which is CBGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're sloppy because they produce
each other's compounds and they are
[SPEAKER_01]: promiscuous because they act on CBGA,
the same precursor molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are promiscuous.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not very accurate at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: My hypothesis is that CBCA synthase,
so this enzyme that is producing CBCA,
[SPEAKER_01]: is producing everything else except for
CBC, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's producing everything else because the
genes are so abundant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone, independent if you're a hamfer
fiber and grain or independent if you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana type or if you're a CBGA type of
plant, independent of that, everyone has a
[SPEAKER_01]: CBCA gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are those guys doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're partying.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And are there other cannabinoids that
exist in cannabis that like we may not
[SPEAKER_04]: even know about that may be more important
in the high factor than we even know or
[SPEAKER_04]: anything that exists like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but you know, the terpenes
are produced in very low quantities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have, for example, that for THC,
you have 28% by dry weight or even 30,
[SPEAKER_01]: even 35% by dry weight while you see,
for example, for mercy and it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: 5% or 3%, but it still smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some things that are even the
part per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're really tiny amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether or not that affects your high,
I don't know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's something that we do
desperately need to do in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry is to do controlled studies
without, you know, knowing what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have this joint, we know the exact
chemo type of this joint or whatever chemo
[SPEAKER_01]: type we know, because we're discovering
like now this THCP, LTIA became a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe there's another cannabinoid that
we had not calibrated the PLC,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, chemists do not hate me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe what I just said was completely
stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But okay, we measure the chemo type and
then we give it to you and then we,
[SPEAKER_01]: Matthew, smoke this and tell me what you
feel, questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can, we can take blood before and
afterwards, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then blinded study that you don't know
what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can do it with however many
hundreds of people, different joints with
[SPEAKER_01]: different chemo types.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that people do not know what they're
getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they tell us, okay, this is what
I felt on Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I exercise, I ate, I slept, I am
depressed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that for alcohol, if you're
depressed or if you're, um, if you ate,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know that there's a difference in how
drunk you get.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Women and men, we know that there's a
difference in alcohol in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we do have some suggestions that there
are differences between women and men,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ate, if you slept, if you exercise,
am I going to feel the same with this
[SPEAKER_01]: joint today than on Friday?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no way to quantify it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need those studies, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and with, with the laws in place
currently, we, we cannot do those studies
[SPEAKER_04]: federally.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, federally we cannot, but we could do
them in, in, in States, in, in regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and in Colorado, one of my,
um, I have some papers with her,
[SPEAKER_01]: Cinnamon Bidwell, a collaborator of mine,
she has the Canavan and in the Canavan,
[SPEAKER_01]: she goes to places because she cannot
bring people on campus and have them go
[SPEAKER_01]: get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she goes in the van and then she takes
up blood before you consume it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after you consume it and what she
tells you is just consume it as you are
[SPEAKER_01]: normally going to consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then she takes blood and she does
some sort of cognitive tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you read it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that there's short-term memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she does, you know, remember,
like try to memorize this, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: grocery store list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and things like that before and after.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so she has done something like that,
but we don't know with particular
[SPEAKER_01]: chemotypes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, for you to measure those
chemotypes, you have to go to a reputable
[SPEAKER_01]: lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some labs that are not that
reputable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some that are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so those particular labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's, that's, that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, I think you wouldn't find a
shortage of people wanting to do that,
[SPEAKER_04]: like willing to give their blood to just
go get baked and give results.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that sounds like fun science.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be super fun, but from the
researcher's perspective, you do need a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of paperwork in order to be able to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even to give you a questionnaire,
even if I'm not touching you, just to give
[SPEAKER_01]: you the questionnaire, there's a huge
amount of paperwork and stuff that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't imagine taking blood.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like all that stuff would be so much
paperwork to even be able to do that on
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's like, why are you doing
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm getting people high.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, is there anything else you want to
talk about before we, uh, finish up?
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to talk about your nonprofit again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we mention what it's called?
[SPEAKER_01]: The agricultural genomics foundation,
AGF and the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I put it here in the, in the chat?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll type it out right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put it in the chat and I can cut
and paste it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agricultural genomics.org.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can paste it over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the name of the nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do a lot of public outreach through
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to educate the public through
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I also do consulting, um, as a
nonprofit gig and, um, you can find me on
[SPEAKER_01]: social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's your, what's your Twitter name?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at kind of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go over here just so we can get it
on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I know everybody's going to be
asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Instagram as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am then on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also use LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see my profile because we don't
know if Twitter is going to live.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Through Elon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody knows yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knows whether Twitter is going to
be a thing anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, is that LinkedIn seems so boring
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, I've never even signed up for
LinkedIn in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I just never done it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know anything about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's supposed to be a professional
Facebook in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been, I, I accept everyone on
LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, do you want to be my friends?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But LinkedIn lately has been good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do consulting and I have found several
gigs through LinkedIn lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's accomplished its job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you never know, but if you
want to hear me rant politically,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I did to Matthew today, then I just
cannot, I do not understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Be political in this climate right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, my family was United farm workers,
so I'm hardcore, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: union, you know, social programs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that why he is called the syndicate?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the, the overall goal with the
syndicate when I originally came up with
[SPEAKER_04]: it and it's like a pie in the sky idea
where I want to take it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of these people that came before
me don't like, even me, we don't have
[SPEAKER_04]: retirement programs for any of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've seen a lot of people that laid
the foundation for this industry just be
[SPEAKER_04]: run over and they're having the hardest
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're having to find new jobs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are people who deserve
recognition and have earned their place in
[SPEAKER_04]: our society.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and I'd love to make it some kind of
union kind of deal where there's
[SPEAKER_04]: retirement plans, medical plans,
you know, things like that for people in
[SPEAKER_04]: the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just a pie in the sky idea,
because I don't know a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_04]: would be into putting their hard time work
and money into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll keep putting my work in,
you know, I, I think, so did you see that
[SPEAKER_01]: there was a video that came out recently
regarding the cannabis industry in
[SPEAKER_01]: California?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know whether, whether you watched
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me, let me see if I, if I find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, but, uh, they, they, um,
they have Steve D'Angelo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, um, I think it's super
interesting because I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: California kind of did it wrong,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Steve D'Angelo is nobody's like,
at least from our point of view,
[SPEAKER_04]: like the, the hardcore people,
like Steve D'Angelo has never been someone
[SPEAKER_04]: that any of us are like, yeah,
I want to see that dude do well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he was the first to bring in
corporate push it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when he found that he wasn't rich
enough to play ball with the big boys
[SPEAKER_04]: recently, he's like, yeah, I shouldn't
have done prop 64.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, well, then why'd you push
it, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: You ruined a lot of people's lives in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friends are now out of, out of work and
hurting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but I think you should watch that,
that YouTube video, because he does talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about that, you know, like he does talk
about prop 64 and and how California kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of did it wrong in that, in that way,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let me see if I find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's such a good, is that my kid
watches videos also in my thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then I get, you know, like,
I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your history gets all twisted up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My history, it's all, all like my kid
watching a stupid toy video.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, I think the hardest part for me
with Steve D'Angelo is that we were the
[SPEAKER_04]: group, like our friends were the group
that was pushing back against him when we
[SPEAKER_04]: were saying, Hey guy, this isn't going to
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to screw a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he puts so much money and hate behind
it to push back against us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the end he realized, Oh,
I don't get to play ball.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I'm not, I'm not a multi trillionaire
like these people that are going to own
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't fair.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't like what I see, but we all
saw that long before he did and he fought
[SPEAKER_04]: against us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, yeah, we get, you don't see
it now, but if they would let you play
[SPEAKER_04]: ball, you probably would have,
you know, that's the way I look at it with
[SPEAKER_04]: him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very disingenuous fellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, you know, I've never understood
really California in general, cause
[SPEAKER_01]: California is as big as Columbia almost in
population, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: California has, I don't know, 45 million
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Columbia has 50 million people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an entire country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it has a notion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really understand why California
doesn't secede from the U S.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, all about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which it's the fourth largest economy in
the world, I think fourth or sixth,
[SPEAKER_01]: but around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so the, just the state of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I don't, it's, it's huge,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What it's going on in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you talk about Steve, it's,
it's so different from the information
[SPEAKER_01]: that we get around here, but it is,
okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I found it, it is called, it's a,
it's a Forbes documentary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to put it here in the chat
Forbes and it's called how America botched
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it was released five days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I watched it this week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think that it's an interesting
take.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think, I think that the
documentary should be how California,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what's going on in the other
States is completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: California is the biggest market in the
entire U S yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's going on here in New York,
it's very different from what happened in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very different from what's going
on in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I think that, that we have to keep
that in mind, but I totally recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: This documentary.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was looking at like early on in
California, when it was first going legal
[SPEAKER_04]: with two 15, but what I saw was like stuff
in Amsterdam where they had bedrock on,
[SPEAKER_04]: like it started out as like, you know,
there were, there were shops all of a
[SPEAKER_04]: sudden you couldn't grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you can't sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't make seeds, but one corporation
was able to take it over and get the main
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I saw an Israel, you know,
like the same kind of stuff happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw in Canada started going that way
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in California with the prop 64,
everybody was kind of like, well,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's looking like it's going to be too
expensive for any of the legacy farmers to
[SPEAKER_04]: own any licenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we couldn't even afford to buy the
equipment to surveil ourselves with the
[SPEAKER_04]: cameras, let alone, you know, afford to
run a business and make money off that.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the guy down the street is,
is quadrupling the production on us and
[SPEAKER_04]: able to charge and, and able to run at a
loss for 10 years, whereas we're small
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't run in a loss for a year,
let alone 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they know that they can wipe out the
market that way and, and, and dry everyone
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know, honestly,
I know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that Israel is very governmentally
controlled, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that here in the U S it's
different because you can get corporations
[SPEAKER_01]: that are multi-billion dollar corporations
where you have, you know, a guy just spend
[SPEAKER_01]: billions of dollars in a social media.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there is no, the capitalism here
is going to an extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think that you need some sort of
governmental regulations in some sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the problem of California
was that there may have been too much
[SPEAKER_01]: governmental regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that you're requiring the legal
industry to operate at a loss compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: the illicit a market, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The illicit market must not buy,
must not test as, as thoroughly the
[SPEAKER_01]: illicit market does not have to have the
packaging that the, so I think that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: operating at a loss due to those
particular laws and regulations,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is something that New York state,
for example, different from Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado is not as regulated as California
or New York state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now in New York state is kind of like,
Hey, do not make people test, like make
[SPEAKER_01]: him test as you would test for a tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to consume the tomato and
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went apple peaking three weeks ago,
two weeks ago, and I took an apple from
[SPEAKER_01]: the tree and I ate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am sure that there were some living
organism in that apple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am sure what it didn't kill me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had I smoked that apple, I think that I
would still not be dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with weed, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hope that there's a time where
anywhere in anywhere that people just
[SPEAKER_04]: don't settle for like, and I feel like
that was the attitude with, with prop 64
[SPEAKER_04]: and two 15 for that matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they're finally going to give us a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we just take what we can get now
and maybe fight for more later.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I've learned, like just in all
laws is like, they don't really give you
[SPEAKER_04]: what they aren't willing to lose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they're not willing to lose more
than that, you're never going to get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's what, what benefits whoever is
in power and can pay the pay the piper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but I do think that there are some
people that are in power that are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for the best for their people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do understand that some people are in
power and it's like, I have the power and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the king, but I think that there are
some people who are in power that are
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Hey, let's build something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I think elections are so
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think that many of the laws and
regulations, for example, regarding the
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.3% THC, like I always, why didn't they
ask me about that regulation, which makes
[SPEAKER_01]: no sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like who is going to get high on a 0.8 THC
fiber hemp when you go to a dispensary and
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a 98% concentrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes no sense at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like who did this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they consult for these kinds of laws?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we know who they consulted for these
kinds of laws?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's some regulations here in
New York state that are kind of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, you have never grown a plant before,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what you're limiting the acreage size
and how are you determining?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have, do you have a house plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a plant living in your living
room?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some regulations that are just,
you know, a guide decided.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lawyer that knew how to write laws
decided.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a long way to go, but I'm really
excited about the future, especially as it
[SPEAKER_04]: comes to science with breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I'm such a, I'm such a nerd when it
comes to breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I love the idea, whether it's,
whether it's your successful or successive
[SPEAKER_04]: generations and breeding in a trait or
whether it's being able to eliminate a
[SPEAKER_04]: trait completely that is, has no
beneficial anything to what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That helps.
[SPEAKER_04]: That helps breeding that helps us make our
projects with successive generations even
[SPEAKER_04]: easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm super stoked to see what you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I'd be really excited to work with
you on any level on that in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really appreciate you taking your
time tonight to come and hang out with me
[SPEAKER_04]: in a conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to have you back soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to one because my job in
extension in Cornell is very related to
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that I get to do that with.
[SPEAKER_01]: On site with, with, with cannabis farmers
and hemp as well, you know, for grain and
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully for grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that I get to do that here as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that breeding that's going to
be the key, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be yet, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm excited that we're also having
these conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for having me.
