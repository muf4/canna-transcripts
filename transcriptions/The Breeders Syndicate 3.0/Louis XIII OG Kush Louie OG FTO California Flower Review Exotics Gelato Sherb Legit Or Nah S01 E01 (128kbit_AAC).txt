[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_02]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_02]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_02]: seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_02]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The syndicate is a collection of seed
makers that want to push back against all
[SPEAKER_02]: the smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_02]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: So welcome to, I guess what we're calling
legit or nah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is the review section that we're
going to be doing, going to different
[SPEAKER_02]: collectives and getting like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily old school strains,
but strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Predating the cookies era and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing if if modern day collectives have
what they claim to have in flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: because a lot of people that have that are
tuning in even or are new to growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: never experienced a lot of these clones
and are relying on their data and their
[SPEAKER_02]: input.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be from these places.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where they get their where they get their
opinions to base their judgments on these
[SPEAKER_02]: strains, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where they maybe go get their
clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a, you know, clone nursery flower
place, you know those places I think still
[SPEAKER_02]: exist, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I I thought it would be kind of
interesting to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I I've also been doing reviews
on stuff that is modern because I've
[SPEAKER_02]: stayed away from it for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, it used to be when people
would ask me that I just like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, like I don't care, you know,
but.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: There comes a point of where like I need
to know because now I've isolated myself
[SPEAKER_02]: from that part of the community for so
long that really I just don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like past gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just been like I don't care,
but I need to care because I can't give
[SPEAKER_02]: valid input or anything on it other than
it has cookies in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it sucks, you know, and and that's
not always going to be the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I'm learning through these reviews,
so without further ado.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the first things I wanted to check
when I went to any collective was OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I get a lot of messages from.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that are that are newer growers and
they ask like what's the best OG Cush seed
[SPEAKER_02]: line?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never tried pure OG Cush and I want
to experience it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to have, you know, a good data
point for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, for me, OG Cush has been
around so long that it's almost like a.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second nature thing to know what OG Cush
is, and I I tend to explain stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of OG Cushy, you know,
like assuming that everybody knows what
[SPEAKER_02]: that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to OG Cush, of course there
were a lot of old clones, so Louis OG is
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the old classic ones coming out of
LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably an OG Cush bag, seed as best as
best anyone can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't seem to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a hybrid, it's so OG Cush dominant
that you don't see any.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I don't see any of the other
parents traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a hybrid, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it's just a classic classic version
of an LA OG Cush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our buddy bitter still holds the cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Resident lung held the cut for a long
time, passed it to me, passed it to
[SPEAKER_02]: bitter, so it's still in our group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something that you know we can
smoke flower of from the original cut
[SPEAKER_02]: still.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's also a good reason I wanted to
choose Louis OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that we still have access
to the flower, something I'm very familiar
[SPEAKER_02]: with, very familiar with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with this, it's kind of giving people
some wiggle room to like this is a review
[SPEAKER_02]: of FTO, which is free trade organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just one of the many companies that
sells local li here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're from LA, but they probably
drive it up to Bakersfield or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says small batch exotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how you know it's dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says exotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sarcasm for all of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it gives a little wiggle room
because OG Cush is OG Cush.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as it's a really good OG,
it can look like a good faithful
[SPEAKER_02]: representation of what Louis can express.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can almost fly out of the radar,
even if it's not exactly it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can hit close enough to where it's
splitting hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's beautiful about OG Cush,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to see essentially if they have
a really decent old school OG Cush.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether this is truly Louis or not,
I could really care less.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see if they're offering a decent
representation of old OG Cush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, on their label, they actually
list it as, I don't know if it's too,
[SPEAKER_02]: King Louis OG and Indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's the code.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could probably scan it from this if
you want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that helps them in any
way, but hopefully it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first off, I'll talk about the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll show some pictures here,
probably going to make it get like pushed
[SPEAKER_02]: into mature audiences, which whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not necessarily impressed with the
look of the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: The texture felt, or the look of it,
I should say the look of it looked like it
[SPEAKER_02]: had been handled a lot, if that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looked like it had been handled a
lot, you know, by someone wearing gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I could tell what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost makes the bud look more oily
because the resin's been kind of been
[SPEAKER_02]: handled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how it looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see from the pictures that I'm
posting, I don't know where it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: insert it, probably somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it wasn't impressive looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I opened this up, I was like,
man, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, well, I'm probably going to be,
you know, I figured it was just going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be as expected for a dispensary
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just low end grow, midsy,
OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say, I will say I was
pleasantly surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks can be deceiving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely looks can be deceiving,
and obviously they were the bottoms of the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottoms of the bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much love given to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were manhandled, but it did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did have some good qualities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to I've already smoked it,
done all that, but I'm going to try to see
[SPEAKER_02]: if I can bring up anything else right now
while I have it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since I'm going to be doing these
reviews and it's the first video,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk about what I'm using to do the
review since this is important,
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my C2, that beautiful Breeders
Syndicate Edition C2 Custom Creations
[SPEAKER_02]: pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have, of course, my Ash
Catcher, my lovely Ash Catcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have cleaned the bowl,
but it was pretty fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Ash Catcher from C2.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The easiest Ash Catcher I've ever cleaned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you should have your shit,
you know, pretty clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least clean your water, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get flavor and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have for the second way,
because that was, of course, combustion
[SPEAKER_02]: method, because you're only going to get
so many flavors that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And frankly, the high is less complex than
using what I call the or not what I call
[SPEAKER_02]: what is called the Vriptec VripMaster.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a vaporizing wand that there's a
hole in the bottom here and there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: rubber gasket that seals to the bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's holes on each side in
each direction that make this the air kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of spin up through something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The heat goes through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I, you know, I've owned
volcanoes, like really nice volcanoes,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've given them all away after getting
this, because I really think this is the
[SPEAKER_02]: most perfect smoking device for me,
for me, in my opinion, for me to evaluate
[SPEAKER_02]: high and flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing's more accurate for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't just go popcorn, you know,
you get full ranges of experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've never smoked blueberry through
one of these things, I highly recommend
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say blueberry, I mean real
blueberry that you know, blueberry tastes
[SPEAKER_02]: like blueberries, which is, I guess,
rare, unless you're having fun and stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I also wanted to give like a less
less experienced smokers take.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm having Brynn kind of, my lady,
chime in on some of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's smoked most of her life,
but it's always been on and off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once we met, like she never paid
attention to any care for strains or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, of course most people don't,
most people don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once she met me, she got, you know,
introduced to the weird world of giving a
[SPEAKER_02]: crap about strains and all the weirdness
that comes along with that and the
[SPEAKER_02]: complexities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And slowly I've been trying to get her to
try these different things or remember
[SPEAKER_02]: what's what, what she likes, what helps
with what.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got some of her input on the smell,
taste, high as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found it kind of interesting because
usually we experience things so different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I smell blueberry and she'll say,
ooh, peppery, you know, or ooh,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's bright, sharp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like different words that don't work for
me when I describe smell, she's an artist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she has a whole different way of
thinking and she thinks in terms of like
[SPEAKER_02]: color, texture, it's very unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it came to the Louis, this was her
input, the smell she said, it smelled like
[SPEAKER_02]: someone with bad breath switched lemon
floor cleaner, which I mean, that's fairly
[SPEAKER_02]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I get lemon floor cleaner too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, the bad breath thing I would
associate more with GMO, but like whenever
[SPEAKER_02]: she smells GMO, she just goes,
you know, like, like she wants nothing to
[SPEAKER_02]: do with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one she does, this is,
she actually really, really likes this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taste coated my tongue like the syrupy
stickiness of lemon heads, which I thought
[SPEAKER_02]: was awesome and hella descriptive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the high calms me down enough to
focus, but doesn't put me to sleep with no
[SPEAKER_02]: anxiety or doesn't put me to sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has no anxiety enough that I was
able to sit down and read 12 chapters,
[SPEAKER_02]: which her sitting for longer than five
minutes is an insane idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's getting her to the point of
where she can sit and focus and read,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is great for her.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like hopefully maybe some of you guys out
there, your ladies may take some input
[SPEAKER_02]: from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're not like as super into this and
as dorky as we are about it, like maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: that might resonate with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some more, I'm not sure, but I wanted to
bring that in because I thought it was
[SPEAKER_02]: really interesting how much it aligned
with mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to spark a bowl and I'll tell
you what I, what I taste through
[SPEAKER_01]: combustion method.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, looks can be deceiving.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has exceptional old traditional mouth
coating, OG Kush flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exactly like I would.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten other OGs from collectives,
even the same, same place I ordered from,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was called highway 99 collective in
Bakersfield.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were offering a Mars OG and it was
going to be the first review, but I felt
[SPEAKER_02]: that it was such a piss poor
representation of Mars that I didn't even
[SPEAKER_02]: like smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just got kicked to the side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was that bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was super unimpressed with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, while it was, it's obviously not the
best grow of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the best handling of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might've been an amazing grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was probably a really good grow
because the flavors there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was probably not the best man
handling of it, but the flavors there,
[SPEAKER_02]: the high is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a nice relaxing anxiety free OG
Kush high because OG Kush tends to be anti
[SPEAKER_02]: anxiety for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not always for everyone, but it is
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the most important thing is that floor
cleaner, mouth coating, lemon floor
[SPEAKER_02]: cleaner, I guess is the best way to put
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people go pledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people go like soapy, like floor
cleaner to me is soapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I often use soapy to describe it,
but floor cleaners, furniture polish is
[SPEAKER_02]: more accurate maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it doesn't have that to me,
it's really hard for me to call it a good
[SPEAKER_02]: OG Kush because that's what I want out of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I feel OG Kush expresses best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's people who feed it heavily,
get OG Kush to be more earthy,
[SPEAKER_02]: smell more fuely gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I get OG, I want furniture polish
like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want it mouth coating.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be completely unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to know that's OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of things that aren't OG
Kush that are earthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of cushy, but that don't have the
furniture polish aspects to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so that's it for the flavor
portion of the combustion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Overall, it tastes like OG Kush should
when it's combusted.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is a whole nother level you can
take something.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you use vaporization techniques,
especially vapor wands, heat wands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sponsored by these guys at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's been bought and paid for from
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was actually a gift from my buddy,
Iriiz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, he was the first person
to turn me onto this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I made fun of him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thought it was his anal torture device.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all use it for that at times,
but it works great for this too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also doubles and works great for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think that the design could be
improved on a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really hard to get ahold of now,
these things, which is a shame.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully, and I know some people are
working on some new wands because these
[SPEAKER_02]: things are that good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what comes in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for now, we are using the Vriptec.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I highly, highly recommend any wand
devices if you want to experience flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: and the high complexity of any strength.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to give this a go with the
old Louis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with these, you want to let it kind of
heat up for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you draw in really slow,
like it's your dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a world of flavor in OG Kush that
unless you vaporize it, you won't
[SPEAKER_01]: experience it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a lemon heads candy in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is super sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Citrus flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost an orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: The complexity is so far away from the
harsh tones of gassy fuel and what we
[SPEAKER_02]: expect from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a world apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, this is definitely, whatever cut
they have is an old OG Kush cut,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I dig it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm glad that at least some people,
you know, if they got lucky enough to buy
[SPEAKER_02]: bud from this cut, they got to experience
OG Kush here locally recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something indescribable about the
flavors you can get out of vaping.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something that runs through all of
them that I think is probably just the
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor of cannabis in general,
but it's super pleasant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never experienced this before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never experienced this with a volcano.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never experienced this with any of those
devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend, Warren, brought a Storzbickel
portable thing, but he had this device
[SPEAKER_02]: attachment on top of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked almost like a Puffco or a Carta
type top.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more like a Carta type top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, you were able to get some
pretty good flavors that were similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: To what I saw with the Vriptec,
it's a closest I've seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Closest, but it still had some of the
popcorn and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was close.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was close.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is a next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the piece we were using for the
Vriptec is another C2, and this one's a
[SPEAKER_02]: double ratchet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually talk about this in the C2
episode that we did recently, season nine,
[SPEAKER_02]: episode one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got stuck into the mature section,
you know, for the adults.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do I got to get in here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Go check out our Discord Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to do more of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, if you have access to FTOs,
King Louis, like I said, this specific
[SPEAKER_02]: batch looked like someone maybe handsies
it up a little bit too much, but it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't regret it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I regret the model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mars OG, I regret that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fully regret that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't regret this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a great job with the growing of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good job with the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: High is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And overall it was a pretty good value
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think they're charging 35 and
eight, which is probably standard for
[SPEAKER_02]: nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what people charge for weed
now, but it wasn't, I'm not mad at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was mad when I looked at it,
but I wasn't mad after, and that's what
[SPEAKER_02]: counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, that will be it for this
edition.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to be that fricking
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just me rambling stone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe it'll be the last one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this totally sucks and everyone
hates it, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check you later.
