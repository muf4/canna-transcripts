[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeder Syndicate 3.0 Amateur
Hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm AutoCat and with me is my co-host Big
Earn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still learning a lot when it comes
to growing cannabis, so follow us along on
[SPEAKER_00]: our journey as we improve our skills and
try to avoid the pitfalls of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some great genetics, visit riotseeds
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a lot of information on cannabis,
join the Patreon and the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget to check out the links below
to the Breeder Syndicate Codex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an awesome strain database that's
worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the other day, Quasia did this survey
and we kind of got this idea that like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a big portion of people in the
syndicate may be new growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so I think it'd be pretty
cool to just talk about some like really
[SPEAKER_02]: basic new stuff that maybe we don't touch
on in the show sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know that Matt doesn't really
like talking about growing stuff too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe that is a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, you know, we can kind of
just talk about from our own perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: because, I mean, at the end of the day,
we're basically amateurs and new
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at least I would consider myself
relatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely still very new.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like the hurdles are still very fresh
in my mind and like the problems that we
[SPEAKER_02]: ran into.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this is a really good time to
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we could just kind of start off
with, you know, the basic needs of a new
[SPEAKER_01]: grower or somebody maybe getting into the
I don't really like to call it a hobby,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for the sake of it's definitely a
hobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would definitely say it's a hobby for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's yeah, I mean, actually me
and D Denali, he's actually another member
[SPEAKER_01]: of a reader syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking about how it's like we
call it a lifestyle, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because especially somebody like him has
been doing it for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think he knows anything else,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, but but maybe I'll go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go ahead, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was just going to say kind of
thinking about starting to grow in my
[SPEAKER_02]: mind, like the first thing before I would
even think about any plants or anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just be thinking about where am I
going to grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's and you know, I think like it's
really important to think about that,
[SPEAKER_02]: not just where you're going to put your
tent for flower, but are you going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: a dedicated veg space?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to have a you know,
you need to have a place to dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're going to if you're going to
want to be running like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like in a perpetual style,
like a lot of us do, you kind of want some
[SPEAKER_02]: of these places to be like dedicated areas
so that it's not just an afterthought,
[SPEAKER_02]: because you can definitely get through
your entire grow and not have a place to
[SPEAKER_02]: dry and like, you know, really ruin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely important to think
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the biggest mistake that a lot of
new growers make probably, at least what I
[SPEAKER_01]: did, and I see what a lot of, you know,
other people do is I think a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: when you first get into it, you buy like a
two by two and like a little 150 watt,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Mars Hydro or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you find yourself pretty quickly
realizing, like you just said,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need multiple spaces potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I think another big thing is you within
a few months, you realize you need like a
[SPEAKER_01]: four by four, at least maybe even two or
maybe a four by four and a two by two to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for your mom, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, I think the biggest mistake
for new growers is is spending your money
[SPEAKER_01]: in not necessarily in a bad way,
but like you're kind of wasting money in
[SPEAKER_01]: the sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you think you, you know,
obviously there's certain people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: only going to have space for a two by two,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but there are a lot of people,
I think the majority of people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: getting into it do have like a little bit
of leeway or more room, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: to play with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, you know, maybe you're, how do you
say that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're willing, maybe not willing,
but you, you just kind of underestimate
[SPEAKER_01]: what you need and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you waste money by maybe buying a
smaller light, and then you have to turn
[SPEAKER_01]: around and, you know, you realize quickly
that if you're trying to get a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of yields for yourself to maintain
your smoke or your own stash or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to realize pretty quickly
that a two by two and a, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 150 watt little light's not going to
probably cover it.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think you're definitely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously everyone is going to
come into this in a different place in
[SPEAKER_02]: their life and have different budgets and
different space requirements and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, there definitely is like
a certain, just basic level that you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's important to kind of be
looking at this as something that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be, you know, when you're buying
like a light, for instance, you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be hopefully using it for a few years,
even, you know, so you'd be looking at it
[SPEAKER_02]: as like a, like an investment kind of
that's going to last you for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, having nice equipment
does, you know, nice equipment lasts
[SPEAKER_02]: longer, you know, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times it just makes it easier
to use, which makes it like funner to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely, I mean, it is definitely an
investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, I think too, in a,
in a, in a, to a certain degree,
[SPEAKER_01]: it does take somebody with a little bit of
money to get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you don't have to be rich by any
means, or you could just budget really
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for example, in my area, there's no
way for me to really get used equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas I've seen other people,
uh, that might have, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: hydro stores going out of business or
whatever, uh, picking up sweet deals in
[SPEAKER_01]: their local area and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas like, in my whole state,
uh, there's literally one hydro stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, like it's cheaper by the
time I drive out there and everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's cheaper for me just to go to Amazon
or wherever, you know, on the internet and
[SPEAKER_01]: just order it to my, to my house,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's definitely important to just
kind of look around and like, I know for
[SPEAKER_02]: me, like when I got into it, it was really
easy to just like, um, go for like the
[SPEAKER_02]: technology that was like being marketed
really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I definitely fell for a lot of
that kind of stuff and spent more money
[SPEAKER_02]: than I needed to, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I didn't really fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't fall so much for the tech aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always tried to, uh, you know,
I'm a big, uh, promoter of like the kiss.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't even ever say this like
the first time I ever called it this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like the keep it simple method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically I try to keep my inputs really
low and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't fall for necessarily like the
tech traps, but what I fell for was more
[SPEAKER_01]: like the seed traps, you know,
like Google, I thought like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: growing up in our, you know, our age,
a lot of stuff, we just Google it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my first instinct was to Google,
you know, what are some good seed seed
[SPEAKER_01]: banks?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to say any of their
names on here, but, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: any one of the Googles that quickly
realizes, uh, you know, uh, that these are
[SPEAKER_01]: likely, well, I wouldn't say you would
realize that they're not necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: scams, but just not what you're really
trying to get into or pay for,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you'll quickly realize that most of
the Google's controlled by like these
[SPEAKER_01]: giant seed banks or corporations that make
that definitely don't have like your
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody's best interests, but their own,
you know, for money and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I fell for that trap, the seat trap
from a couple of years, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say just for like the place
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think like at the bait, at the
simplest terms, like you're going to at
[SPEAKER_02]: some point either decide if you're going
to have to be in a tent or you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be in like some kind of closet scenario
or, or you're going to have like a
[SPEAKER_02]: dedicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so I think those are things that
you need to think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, um, and just going to think of the
area that you have and just give yourself
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit of time to plan ahead for
what you're going to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's going to set yourself up
for the biggest part of your success.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think like part of that too,
going into something else that I would
[SPEAKER_02]: mention is that you want to think about
like the environment that you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be growing in, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously you, if you're able to plan
your grow to be somewhere where the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment's better, uh, that's,
that's just going to give yourself a leg
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as controlling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something to think about too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what do you think about when I talk
about environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, for me, the first thing that
comes to mind, uh, is, is, is my area like
[SPEAKER_01]: dry, is there a lot of moisture in the
area?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause for me in my area, you know,
especially in the summertime, humidity is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is a big problems for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say a big problem, but it's
probably the biggest problem for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it hasn't caused me problems lately,
but like, you know, am I in a basement
[SPEAKER_01]: where there's a lot of water leaking,
you know, in my mind that, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's mold that's in, you know,
I don't deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe I'm wrong in saying that,
but in my mind, whenever I think of like a
[SPEAKER_01]: dark, cool, moist area that maybe at least
around here, a lot of the basements aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes you go in some of these
basements around here in my area and
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll see like mold or just filth or
like, you know, is it a clean space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a dry space?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it isn't, what can I do to,
you know, maybe get my tents up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Off the ground or take certain precautions
or, or get it set up to where it is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be because you don't want to get into
the middle of a grow and have your lights
[SPEAKER_01]: and your, your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially if you're in a place where
you might still be pretty illegal to be
[SPEAKER_01]: doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't, you can't really be moving
around or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you want to make sure you're,
you're, you're starting off in a good spot
[SPEAKER_01]: for hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely say, uh, airflow too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I going to be able to get fresh air
into this space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, those are the main things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That come to my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I think the main thing like for
me in the winter time, I'm in a cabin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like my floor is kind of the crawl
space isn't the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my root zones get really cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another thought too,
is it in the winter time, is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: is it going to be good enough for a
environment for that as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, but yeah, it's kind of my thoughts
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if, and if there is any kind of
issues, those are the main things you need
[SPEAKER_01]: to address.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're really wanting to grow,
you know, I'm at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're saying is all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the environment is super
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, temperature obviously is going to
be important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humidity is going to be important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I would say that there are
some places that you can start if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in like numbers, you know,
cause I think like when you're,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're new having like a number or
like some metric that you can gauge as far
[SPEAKER_02]: as like how you're doing is helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, you know, early on for me looking
at things like a VPD chart, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of going loosely off of that and
trying to get into those good ranges,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, for each, um, uh, like life
cycle that the plants in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I think things like that are
pretty, you know, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a ton of good information out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as given like specifics,
I wouldn't, I don't, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's obviously going to be super
dependent on your environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I would just say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, take things like that into account
before you just like get super excited and
[SPEAKER_02]: throw up a tent and start growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, we've all done that and it,
you know, you turn out some less than
[SPEAKER_02]: stellar stuff sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think early on, it's easy to get
discouraged from maybe growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if you kind of have like some more,
um, experiences and just doing stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: this, we'll set yourself up to have like a
really good run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it'll be really,
yeah, you'll know if you like it after the
[SPEAKER_02]: first one or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, uh, you know, the biggest thing I
know for me too, uh, when I first started
[SPEAKER_01]: really taking growing seriously again was,
yeah, you know, when you run into those
[SPEAKER_01]: problems, cause you are so, uh,
excited to get that grow, the grow going
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever, you could waste a lot of
beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could waste a lot of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just be like you said,
discouraged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, especially as we try to get more
people into the hobby or lifestyle,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's super important,
but, um, a real life example for me right
[SPEAKER_01]: now that I'm facing on a personal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I, the way I have my tents set up
is they're in different rooms and one of
[SPEAKER_01]: my tents, uh, my four by four is actually
in a room with a dog door.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm facing a lot of problems right now,
not a lot, but some issues with
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature control because, you know,
um, for starters, I made the mistake of,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, watering right before my lights went
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've since switched that, which has
kind of turned everything around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I've, I think what I was getting
at with this is just being flexible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, um, in that room, I have to
have this year for the first time I had to
[SPEAKER_01]: put in a, um, like a radiant heater,
like a little oil radiant heater in there
[SPEAKER_01]: just to kind of give it a little boost to
make sure that I'm not having big swings
[SPEAKER_01]: and humidity and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm getting, I got a slight.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few specs of PM and I've never seen
powdery mildew ever in my tents,
[SPEAKER_01]: other than when I first started growing
about four years ago, when I had brought
[SPEAKER_01]: some plants inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just something that I think is
important is just being flexible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, before you get going,
like you said, just make sure you got a
[SPEAKER_01]: heater, make sure you got these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, if you're planning out your
grow, you can save yourself a lot of money
[SPEAKER_01]: by finding like secondhand stuff like
heaters or air conditioners or stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can promise you, if you wake up one
day and you say, I want to grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're probably going to fork out with,
you know, in the range of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: six, seven, 800 to a thousand dollars easy
just to get a good little, if not more,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when you're talking about better
lights and things and all this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we, it's definitely, um,
there definitely is some like startup
[SPEAKER_02]: costs, you know, involved and it's,
I just think it's important to start
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at those things early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's so many cool things now,
like obviously like I'm super new,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like listening to the older guys talk
about when they started growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, you know, they didn't have any
of the resources that there are now,
[SPEAKER_02]: any of the hydro shops that there are now,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that right now is like a really
cool time as far as growing because like
[SPEAKER_02]: there's so much information available and
that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's products like AC infinity who,
um, you know, they have these controllers
[SPEAKER_02]: that are like super affordable and they'll
kind of keep your environment in a really
[SPEAKER_02]: good range.
[SPEAKER_02]: In like a very easy way with very minimal
effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it is worth looking at those things
and not kind of like looking at them as
[SPEAKER_02]: bonuses because, um, in a lot of ways,
like your environment is going to be so
[SPEAKER_02]: much more important than even like,
you know, what you're feeding sometimes,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, airflow, uh, is super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know there's all kinds of ways
of doing it and everybody's got their own
[SPEAKER_01]: way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a lot of people will run
like an intake and an exhaust,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm actually fortunate enough that I,
on all my tents, um, like it would,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's worked so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I just have, um, ex exhaust fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, that's worked out really great for
me and my environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just it saves, of course it saves,
uh, the bill and a big part of the reason
[SPEAKER_01]: why I choose to do that is noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do run like some AC infinity,
um, you know, um, exhaust fans and I have
[SPEAKER_01]: to say I run them because they're the
quietest that I can find for a good price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like every other one I've had is super
loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and just kind of kind of put a point
to, you know, your environment or your
[SPEAKER_01]: airflow and stuff like that being key is,
you know, if you, I think, I think when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to all this man is the biggest thing
is if you run into problems to not to give
[SPEAKER_01]: up and try to figure stuff out,
because all this stuff is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: flexible on the individual grower and
where you're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know when I started growing,
dude, I was based in a lot of my info off
[SPEAKER_01]: of guys that were growing out in the
middle of the desert or out in the middle
[SPEAKER_01]: of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ran into a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the biggest thing is getting
your hands dirty and making mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just kind of the big,
you know, it really changed my growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I guess just making me or making me a
better girl is I was having pH problems
[SPEAKER_01]: and overwatering when I first got back
into growing a few years back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my girlfriend was like, I was just,
at the time I was just chopping them,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I run into problems in my mind,
I was like, you know, Oh, it's just a weak
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm dropping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, you know, you're probably,
and we, I got to talking to her and she's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, it's probably just something that
you're doing wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, you know, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just spent like a month or two,
just researching like issues and trying
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of just cutting a plant down,
I would try to put it through everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and try a nutrients,
Cal Mag, you know, uh, worked on my
[SPEAKER_01]: watering, uh, things like that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so to finish up my point, that kind of
got off on tangent there, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: airflow is super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to need you a fan or two,
uh, inside the tent moving around,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to need you at least an
exhaust and some people are going to need
[SPEAKER_01]: intakes as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, depending on what your
lights, uh, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest thing is to, to find your
environment, like see where you're at,
[SPEAKER_02]: measure it, you know, get a good idea and
then figure out what you need to do to,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, get into the range that, you know,
that you find on like a VPD chart or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that, you know, uh, just to give
yourself a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying to the stick directly to
those charts and that they're the end all
[SPEAKER_02]: be all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you, you know, they are,
um, established metrics for a reason kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have anything else that really kind
of talk about their environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think maybe pest control a
little bit, but you kind of, I think
[SPEAKER_01]: something as a new beginner to,
uh, maybe just to go ahead and pick up is
[SPEAKER_01]: some, just some like little sticky traps.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some fly traps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, do you have anything else that you
could, uh, think of like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there are a million topics as far
as IPM goes, and there are a lot of other
[SPEAKER_02]: people that are better qualified to talk
about it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys have pests, um, that,
you know, come to the breeder syndicate,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, discord, there are a ton of smart
people and they will help you with your
[SPEAKER_02]: best problem, but I am not the one to do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess for me, that only speak about the
sticky traps because generally the only
[SPEAKER_01]: problems I really have is maybe,
um, a few, uh, gnats or flies or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit flies, whatever you call them fungus
flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's really about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, as far as I kind of almost like
what you saying, I, I'm not really an
[SPEAKER_01]: expert on pest control or management,
so definitely join the breeder syndicate,
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon and join the discord and those
guys over there will help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, seriously, it sounds like we're
just like plugging it, but like in a very
[SPEAKER_02]: real way, there are super knowledgeable
people that can really help you with those
[SPEAKER_02]: kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next thing I would think that we,
you know, we talked about, you have your
[SPEAKER_02]: location, you have your environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, now you're going to need a light,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, um, and so like the base,
most basic thing that I think about when
[SPEAKER_02]: you think about lighting is light cycles
for the plants, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you are going to want to know,
you know, like that you're, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, like in a veg situation, you want to
be running, say 18 hours of light,
[SPEAKER_02]: six hours of darkness for flower,
say 12 hours of light, 12 hours of
[SPEAKER_02]: darkness.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these are just basic guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely some tweaks that you
can do to fit your needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, you know, like as you grow
in, uh, to this hobby and kind of learn
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants and stuff, you'll know more of
what you need, you know, what those needs
[SPEAKER_02]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's kind of ties into,
uh, what we were talking about earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're just your environment in a,
in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, if you're going to be
growing traditional plants, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and you're not going to be
touching auto flowers or growing any auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers, you're going to probably want to
have two tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to, you could simply veg to
a certain point, uh, veg your plants to a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain size, whatever that may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then flip the flower, uh,
you know, a 12, 12 light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could run them during veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could run them for, I actually run,
I'll be honest, like a lot of most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff I run, um, as far as veg is that I
run them for, I run 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some times in certain plants,
uh, that maybe require a little bit less
[SPEAKER_01]: light or, or whatever, you know,
depending on the time of the year as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cause of heat and stuff like
that all run stuff shorter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most time, and I don't know if
this stems back from growing a lot of auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers, I just like to push them as much
as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, but that being said, that's,
you know, you can run it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of different ways you
can set up your light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another thing I think that is a
topic that if you want to dive really deep
[SPEAKER_01]: into that kind of just join the discord
and there's a lot more people that know a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a, yeah, there's a lot to
read about as far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're, you know, we're new as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as far as that, you know,
as far as lights goes, the biggest things
[SPEAKER_02]: that I would talk about when you go to buy
one, um, is make sure that you're getting
[SPEAKER_02]: enough light for the space that you're
going to be growing in, um, that you can,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, obviously just look at that up,
just Google how much light you need for
[SPEAKER_02]: the amount of space you're growing in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could find tons of weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, tons of ways to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if, if most of the time on all the
lights that I've bought in the last few
[SPEAKER_01]: years, you know, they all have a
description on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you plan to grow in a two by two,
then look for a light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be appropriate for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if that's a, I almost all
lighting companies have different ranges
[SPEAKER_01]: of lights, uh, more advanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my experience, I would say that most of
the lights tend to say that they're good
[SPEAKER_02]: for a space that is actually bigger than
what they really are good for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I think, uh, what I would say as
far as this goes is just kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, read some reviews, get a handful of
lights in mind that are good for the size
[SPEAKER_02]: of your space and watch a few reviews on
YouTube, you know, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people that are dedicated to
looking at lights and that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you just want to make sure that
you're getting something from like a
[SPEAKER_02]: reputable company, you know, that kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause after all, like, you know,
some of these are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of power that you're pushing
through them and, you know, the risk of
[SPEAKER_02]: fire and stuff like that is a very real
risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is something that you need to
think about when, you know, if you were
[SPEAKER_02]: buying any other kind of electronics that
you were going to run, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: basic, you know, daily and for like a
significant period, like you would think
[SPEAKER_02]: about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to think about it for lights
and stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, when you're getting off
the ground, it's okay to take a few
[SPEAKER_01]: courts, you know, cut a few corners,
but when you're talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, for sure safety, things like your
light, I think that's super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only just because of, you know,
it might get a fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might get shocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a lot of stuff I've actually
personally been shocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like something I take kind of
serious, you know, when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: safety, cause you don't think about that
kind of stuff until it happens to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I mean, you know, I hate
plugging people, but there's plenty of
[SPEAKER_01]: people or I should take a lighting
companies out there that you can Google.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cheap ones that are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost all of them will probably get you
to, to where you need to be as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: finishing in your veg and your flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can go up to a higher towards,
I think we both kind of are more on the
[SPEAKER_01]: higher end now in our growing,
uh, you know, careers or whatever you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to call it, not a career, but in our,
in the hobby that we're at a point where
[SPEAKER_01]: we got a little bit of on the better side
of lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I will say that I've also haven't,
I wouldn't go as far as saying I've
[SPEAKER_01]: noticed a giant difference, just speaking
from my own experience, maybe in the
[SPEAKER_01]: weight department, but that's,
you know, a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I think like, I think like the
things that think about really like in the
[SPEAKER_02]: quality, like in the price of the light is
just like, like, you know, if the fixtures
[SPEAKER_02]: made well and stuff like that,
you know, like there becomes points
[SPEAKER_02]: outside of whether or not the,
um, LED, you know, chip set is the correct
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are different spectrums.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are different, there's literally,
this could be an entire episode on its
[SPEAKER_02]: own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I would just say that people need to,
you know, just really read about the
[SPEAKER_02]: lights before you buy them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, cause if you get on Amazon
and you just Google, uh, grow light,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's tons of different, you know,
um, results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them will say that they're a
thousand Watts and they're, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're really not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just kind of look at like actual
wattage output and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, really kind of dig into that a
little bit, um, because there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: information there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, to put a point on that,
I think that, you know, be careful too,
[SPEAKER_01]: just be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like, I think the easiest way to
probably get some good information is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably joining a discord that has a lot
of people that have grown for a long time
[SPEAKER_01]: and just get the general opinion on stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also kind of using maybe
something like Reddit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you gotta even have a little bit
of caution with Reddit a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but generally most people will kind of be,
you can kind of find the information you
[SPEAKER_01]: need there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and just by trial and error,
but I'll be honest, as far as lights are
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned, I think they're at a point now
where you're not unless you're like trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to save a lot of money or in scamp,
like you're probably going to get a decent
[SPEAKER_01]: light, especially if you wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would also advise maybe waiting till
like, uh, four 20 or a holiday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause a lot of times we got black Friday
coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be sales and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely think about those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I do think you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like with lighting technology,
I think like, um, most companies offer,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, similar fixtures at like similar price
points.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can definitely find them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most important thing when it
comes to a light that I actually am going
[SPEAKER_01]: through right now as far as I just
upgraded one of my lights is having a
[SPEAKER_01]: dimmer switch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of them all now have them on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're like me and you have some
that are out of date, um, and that being
[SPEAKER_01]: said, that specific brand, um,
you know, these lights are not broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, it's just time for me to get a new
light and get a dimmer switch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that is actually one of those are
some of the cheaper lights on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've worked fantastic for a little
two by twos and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so yeah, definitely lots of good
resources out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do your research when you're buying a
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just, uh, buy the cheapest one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, you could kind of get lost
in the sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really think as a new grower,
we get so excited, you know, about
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment and gear and you can kind of
like almost screw yourself up by like
[SPEAKER_01]: overthinking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, something I like to do with,
with my lights, excuse me, and my bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: tents are my lower intense is I like to
buy at this point, uh, I kind of like to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy a light that obviously has a dimmer on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's made a little bit bigger,
you know, because it's kind of like we
[SPEAKER_01]: were talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never, it's never a good thing to buy
a smaller light, but it's okay to always
[SPEAKER_01]: buy a bigger light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to upgrade, you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like for me, I am currently not able to
put five by fives efficiently into my
[SPEAKER_01]: space, uh, without having sacrificed like
living space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that being said, once soon as I move,
which I'm going to be doing here soon,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to upgrade to like five by fives
or eight by eight or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like for me, I had that in mind for the
future, you know, and trying to,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's something super important
when it comes to the lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you know, if you have an led
and you're able to just run it at 85% in
[SPEAKER_02]: your tent versus having a smaller led and
that you have to run at a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_02]: all the time, um, you know, that also
decreases the life of the fixture and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's just lots of different,
there's lots of benefits to getting
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's a little bit bigger than
what you need probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good way to put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was going to say the next thing that
I would think about is like, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got a place to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got your environment dialed in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a light for the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you got to feed them something and you
got to have some kind of medium that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think like this is such a huge topic
and such a it's littered with just a
[SPEAKER_02]: minefield, you know, um, and I don't,
the biggest thing that I would say as far
[SPEAKER_02]: as this is concerned is every company will
tell you that their product will grow you
[SPEAKER_02]: the best plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and there are better products and
worse products, but overall, if you get a
[SPEAKER_02]: reputable brand of, uh, some kind of,
you know, some, you know, personally I
[SPEAKER_02]: use, uh, Kana A and B, um, I, you know,
I really like Kana, uh, but you can use
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but find something that, um,
is fairly basic, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, not a ton of additives and stuff and
just learn those things and just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think like learning good watering
habits, I say this all the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was one of the biggest things that
helped with my growing was to really learn
[SPEAKER_02]: my watering cycles and like really know
like, okay, this plant is ready to drink
[SPEAKER_02]: and, um, just feeling like, and it's,
it's not, it's not super complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just repetition, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so if you're, if you're picking your
pots up every other day and filling what
[SPEAKER_02]: they feel like, and that kind of thing,
and like knowing where they're at,
[SPEAKER_02]: you get a sense of, uh, when they're ready
for water, you know, you can get like,
[SPEAKER_02]: if I pick up a one gallon pot,
I can tell you, you know, this is dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, just basically, you know,
just the way it feels at this point,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that I, that really helped me
with watering, um, in the beginning to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of prevent myself from overwatering
was actually picking up one of those,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, like sprayers, you know, like a round
up to get, it's, there are the bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a two gallon, uh, sprayer and
it's got several different, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, nozzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you could kind of adjust the nozzle to
like different types of streams and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I have, I've actually been doing
for the last couple of years is using that
[SPEAKER_01]: same one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, for like seedlings, I'll set it
on the mist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like that way, not only am I not
overwatering, I'm not like blowing my
[SPEAKER_01]: plant over or accidentally spraying too
much water on it or whatever and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: knocking the seedling down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real gentle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I move up to like the
bigger, uh, a little bit older plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe like a gallon or so, or half
gallons, I'll switch over to the fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just helps me, especially in
plastic pots, cause in my environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic pots tend to like, I found myself
like overwatering in a plastic pot more
[SPEAKER_01]: than I do in say a fabric pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, uh, for me like that sprayers like
helped tremendously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think you're a hundred percent
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the biggest things is
definitely as a new beginner is
[SPEAKER_02]: overwatering and, and, you know,
Well, it's something too, that I would say
[SPEAKER_02]: with overwatering when I talk,
you know, what you're saying is definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can like, especially when they're
small, like hammering, they're just
[SPEAKER_02]: flooding them with water is rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, in my mind, overwatering is
not necessarily like how much water you
[SPEAKER_02]: give the plant in one watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just how frequently you're watering
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to make sure that your pots
are drying out basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, that's, uh, you know,
I'm not saying, I certainly am not like
[SPEAKER_02]: saying that you should have your plants
drooping every time that it's time to
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I, you know, when I have my plants
in veg part of like, uh, my process of
[SPEAKER_02]: learning the plants, while I'm kind of
like looking through something will be to
[SPEAKER_02]: just literally just while they're in veg,
let them dry out until they group one
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, just, uh, watering fully note when I
water it and then just watch how many days
[SPEAKER_02]: it takes for them to group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then that kind of gives me an idea
of like when, you know, maybe I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: feed them a day before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, just to give yourself like a,
um, kind of like a way to gauge,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I kind of remember what my thought I
lost my train of thought up there earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: of what I was going to get at,
but, um, about how you said, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's good to get in there and kind of lift
your pots up and kind of feel,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when they're dry and then,
and then also when they're fully wet,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you can kind of get that gauge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what I was getting at with
that was as a new beginner, I think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, a lot of people watch,
uh, you know, I'm not gonna say any names
[SPEAKER_01]: with the watch a video and they think
like, I gotta put a net on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I think a lot of people will
bypass like the important steps of
[SPEAKER_01]: learning how to properly grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not saying I know, but like,
I think there is definitely that like,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, bond or, or just through experience as
you go, you look at the plants and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: almost look at a plant and you should,
you know, get to that level eventually
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can kind of gauge what it needs
by just looking at it or at least narrow
[SPEAKER_01]: it down to like at least two different
possible things, you know, and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: getting in there and picking them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another key point, what I was going to
get at was when you're doing this,
[SPEAKER_01]: also be looking for herms because that's
another thing that can discourage people
[SPEAKER_01]: really quickly is, you know, I know
myself, like I didn't have a mentor or
[SPEAKER_01]: people, a club or anyone to really talk to
you about this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whenever I would see a herm,
I would be like, well, I guess this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would be like, this is bad plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not going to give me what I
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that being said, learning now,
when I see a herm, a lot of times,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially on a, uh, from a, if I pop a
seed and it's this seeded plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the plant from the seed,
a lot of times, you know, the hormones
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't as stable as they would be maybe if
you didn't, uh, or if you cloned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like that being said, like sometimes if
you're just seeing them on the lowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, that being said, the lower of the,
the lower limbs of the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe it's only a couple of herms or
little sacks that you're finding,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can kind of just pick those off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times you'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas like, you know, a new grower might
see that and we'll think, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, dang, do I got a male?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is this, uh, what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think just in general, I think like,
I think that the biggest takeaway is
[SPEAKER_02]: spending time with your plants is the only
way to learn your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no other, there's no other
substitution for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to grow the plant the best
possible, then being around it and seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: how it responds to different things is the
only way to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on that, on that point as well,
I would say, you know, I have had people
[SPEAKER_02]: ask me like about starting growing and
stuff, just like, you know, friends,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I always kind of just recommend just
maybe get something like cocoa or some
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of lightly amended soil and some kind
of, you know, uh, trusted bottle,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, like, uh, like liquid nutrient program
and just kind of follow like the,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, lower recommended setting of their
feeding program and just, just see what it
[SPEAKER_02]: does, you know, uh, just do some drain to
waste, um, learn your how to water,
[SPEAKER_02]: have your environment dialed in,
you know, get, learn how to turn the
[SPEAKER_02]: lights up and down, you know, just things
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it sounds very basic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you, it quickly becomes not that
basic when you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're doing something like as a
beginner, um, I think like a lot of these
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient companies, they have tons of
additives and different things,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they all tell you that they're going
to make your plant the best plant ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, so you, you want to get those
because obviously you want the best plant
[SPEAKER_02]: ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so you get those additives and,
you know, you end up in this place where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're just adding stuff in and you don't
really know what each input is going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if you kind of just start
simple and then slowly add onto your
[SPEAKER_02]: program, you'll, um, you'll, uh,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you'll just be able to gleam a lot
more from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, probably save yourself some
money and headaches and stuff like that in
[SPEAKER_02]: the long run.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because most of those programs
are made, uh, with, you know, like with
[SPEAKER_02]: those people in mind that just want to go,
you know, mix it up in water or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, it's just an easy way to
start kind of seeing how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think, I think you're a hundred
percent right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if I don't think you need to be
buying a bunch of, especially as a new
[SPEAKER_01]: grower, and especially if you don't know
what, uh, nitrogen or phosphorus or,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, potassium is or what it does and heck,
I can't really even speak on it myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what I can speak on is your cannabis
plant, your basic plan is going to need
[SPEAKER_01]: those three things and it's going to need
some cow mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to need some other trace
elements and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think like you said, just get you a
basic setup, a basic, uh, one part or even
[SPEAKER_01]: a two part type thing for a veg and flour
and get you some cow mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, people swear by glacial
amendments and all this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would probably just stick away from that
in the beginning and you can always build
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not seeing the results you
want, then you can, it's kind of like we
[SPEAKER_01]: get, we're talking about reading that plan
and that relationship building.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll know if something's not right,
if you're not, if you don't have good
[SPEAKER_01]: leads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even, and you know, even I'll say,
even cow mag, I, you know, I've done
[SPEAKER_02]: several grows where I've not used
anything, but K and A and B now,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, to just kind of get an idea of what it
looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And generally, I mean, you know,
there's always going to be things that
[SPEAKER_02]: when you finish your growth, you feel like
you can improve on, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I just think if you're new,
get, uh, get, you know, uh, a two or three
[SPEAKER_02]: part nutrient system, get some,
you know, cocoa or whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: some pro mix and, you know, just,
just start growing, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll learn, you'll learn quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you'll become obsessed with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we are, and you'll be reading about
calcium and all sorts of stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, just take it one step
further.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just say, um, you know,
from the way I would do it and maybe not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily recommend, but just the,
the, if I was going to do it all over
[SPEAKER_01]: again with the knowledge that I had,
I guess I would, I would lean more into
[SPEAKER_01]: like your, um, a basic soil, um,
maybe for example, like Fox farm,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, ocean and then strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just to break it down to the most
basic level of doing it is usually I do a
[SPEAKER_01]: two part, um, ocean and then I do a one
part strawberry, um, for most of my pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think something else that,
uh, you could do is have your bottles on
[SPEAKER_01]: standby because like most of the time you
can kind of set yourself up with just the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil to get you to veg and not really have
to do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just a little cow mags, just
depending on your situation and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for me, where I lean into nutrients or
bottles, for example, is during flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's usually like, if I'm seeing,
um, usually by week three to four,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, um, um, I'm hitting with a little bit
of flower newts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think something that being said,
if you are doing soil, do it in really
[SPEAKER_01]: small increments, you don't, I have very
rarely, rarely found that I needed to give
[SPEAKER_01]: as much as they recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just as a general rule of thumb,
I always start at like half strength,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, what they recommend as normal for
pretty much any nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, and you can see,
start that with seeds and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just kind of see what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's, it, all of these things
are just, um, you have to observe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you have to just try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we could get, this could be an
hour long topic in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe what we could do is kind of do
some grow along the videos in the future
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of just give a visual
representation to people that are watching
[SPEAKER_01]: and, um, you know, the kind of stuff that
we're talking about and how we handle
[SPEAKER_01]: things, I think, uh, would be a lot
easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like you said earlier,
this is a, a big conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there's going to be a lot of
people watching that are saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what about organics?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, uh, it's kind of like we
were saying before we're, this is why it's
[SPEAKER_01]: called the amateur hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we were amateurs at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still learning ourselves and we can
only speak on it from our own perspectives
[SPEAKER_01]: in the way that we do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, you know, I think that being said
that always keep trying to learn,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, try new methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as a beginner grower, that's the
biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're seeing issues, try to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Work through them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, you know, just build that
language or that relationship with the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, before you know it,
uh, you, you'll be able to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: navigate that pretty easy, but just about
look visual looking at them, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think like it's, yeah, you're
absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest thing I would say is just that
we are not saying, um, this is necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: even the best way to grow, you know,
but as far as starting out as a beginner,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've never grown a plant before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you're very, you know, have very
limited, you know, uh, experience with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think these kind of doing it very simply
to start out with, uh, is going to give
[SPEAKER_02]: you the, you know, the best possible
experience with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're more than, you know,
you can start adding stuff in and like
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing how, you know, obviously you,
you're going to always want to improve.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, just give yourself some time to
learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think it's kind of becomes full
circle to this learning your environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: what works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it is going to be,
like you said, an investment, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you are going to make mistakes and
have times where you, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you think it's not going to go the way you
want, or you get herms or your plants not
[SPEAKER_01]: doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think to get to that place where
everybody really wants to be in that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess at the end of the day is just
having good smoke for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, uh, you just gotta keep
trying and keep experimenting and finding
[SPEAKER_01]: out what works for you, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I think, yeah, it's all it's
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As, as you start to dial things in,
you'll just get better and better and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you'll just be, you know, uh,
more satisfied with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the nutrient or, or,
uh, you know, feeding your plants is such
[SPEAKER_01]: a huge topic that, you know, it is worth
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's full of traps.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could spend three or four hours like
going through the process, the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we definitely will talk about these
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if you guys out there have
questions that you want to answer,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Phil, please leave them in the
comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, you know, we may not know the answer,
but we have friends that do, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we will, we will talk to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we want everyone to just,
uh, enjoy growing like we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get questions, put them down in the
comment section and we'll try to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, get them answered and get them
into the next video.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to try to do some different
type of content and things over,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the next few weeks, maybe try to get a
weekly episode or a bi-weekly episode out
[SPEAKER_01]: for you guys and gals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think we got some cool stuff coming
up too, like the solo cup competition
[SPEAKER_02]: thing that we're going to be doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's going to be pretty sick,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Pine Lensum was generous enough to
offer up some mule skinner seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, we got, uh, a wrestling belt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, everybody saw that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, come on out and, you know,
we're going to try to just have a good
[SPEAKER_02]: time, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, the biggest thing is we
want to have fun and we want people to,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, just enjoy growing the plant
and like, uh, enjoy genetics the same way
[SPEAKER_02]: that we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's tons of cool people,
you know, on the discord and on the
[SPEAKER_02]: Patreon and stuff that, that, um,
yeah, they're doing cool shit every day
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, it's if, you know, if you want to
be a part of that, it's there to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, to come and hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the belt is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if your discord doesn't have belts for
your growing competition, I think you're
[SPEAKER_01]: probably in the wrong discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe no, but, but I guess, you know,
to plug a few things here, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: go check out riotseas.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to get them sweet blueberry
turps, that blue bonnet, work those F
[SPEAKER_01]: twos, all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got high and lonesome on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, who else we got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, pat pock, uh, go check out those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, go check out that website,
riotseas.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check out the codex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's a new database on strains that
they're also building, uh, one,
[SPEAKER_01]: a thousand and Matt and company.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few other people and I'm sorry
if I'm missing everybody, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I think the biggest thing of
course is, uh, go check out the main show
[SPEAKER_01]: on this channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Matt show and thousand show,
um, every Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: At 6 PM, uh, specific standard time and
then, um, 9 PM Eastern time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you tune into that every
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, join the patron,
join the discord, uh, like comment and
[SPEAKER_01]: subscribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got anything else for him or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all have a good day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Catch y'all in the discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
