[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_01]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_01]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_01]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_01]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew, here with my co-host Thousand
Folden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we're going to be having local
botanist and farmer Dan, who is currently
[SPEAKER_01]: muted because his kid is bashing toys
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we're going to be doing a recap of
Season 11 and doing some Q&As for people
[SPEAKER_01]: in the audience and ones we've taken
before the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thousand, take it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, recapping Season 10, launching
Season 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a few questions from the
Discord, but also, of course, for
[SPEAKER_02]: welcoming everyone to just put questions
in the chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe to kick us off, what has everyone
been smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of us who have been smoking,
have you all been growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of us who have been growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, my sick ass wasn't smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt is straight edge right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, currently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right now, not right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking to your mic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I talking to my mic now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you not hear me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, I've been smoking the sweet pea
a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, yeah, that stuff's really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super tasty, super consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Dan, you're muted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took some rips of the wet dream,
the green crack times blue dream,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that shit was fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Screw for sending that
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been sampling my freshly harvested
Santa Cruz rakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got four of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And two of them, I mean, again,
just visually, purely visually look a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: more blue dream than the other two.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I think profile wise,
there's definitely quite the mix across
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So still getting used to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of them has got a killer heady
buzz, which I love for the daytime.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll probably be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that I've ever talked about
why I'm not smoking on our show.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got sick with something that people
have been arguing about ever since I
[SPEAKER_01]: brought it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabinoid hyper emesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's supposed to be like hyper
emetic, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Local maybe science guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a medicine guy, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hyper emesis syndrome, which makes you
essentially you flood your cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system so much that it makes you throw up
nonstop until you either die or quit
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it shows up quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've had to stop smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be for supposedly 11
months if you're a lifetime smoker to
[SPEAKER_01]: completely flush it out so you can smoke
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why my hiatus exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's been fun shucking stuff and not
being able to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been quite a treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The syrup cream pie is very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it like it's very greasy resin and
it makes a lot of greasy resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about all I got to say on the smoke
front.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt, did you want to kick us off with
some of the teasers, some of the drops
[SPEAKER_02]: that are happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so we have my drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Pax drop Santa Cruz go form and we
have high and lonesome drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my drop is going to be I call it Viva
la Blue Volution, which is just it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry in cross work or I X as it's
written, which is a totally made up term
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it fits because you need a term for
something like crossing in between
[SPEAKER_01]: generations as opposed to going straight
generational work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, like there's there's a back
cross in there at some point and and
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing back to DJ Short's blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the blueberry in cross,
which was my most popular from the
[SPEAKER_01]: original blue bonnet release.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was DJ Short's blue bon or
blueberry F4 from an old pack that I
[SPEAKER_01]: selected cross to the blue bonnet,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it did was take all the looks
from DJ Short's blueberry, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably some of its most awesome part of
its traits is the looks because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful, purple, cushy looking stuff and
cross that to the blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it injected heavy blueberry turps into
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of what I always imagined
the pictures of like when I was buying
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds at DJ Short's stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how I imagine those things growing
out, smelling like blueberry, looking like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's what I reimagined with
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it worked out really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we redid that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we crossed that to Mac Daddy,
which I have no idea what Mac Daddy is,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it looks like a better version of Mac
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it smells like a bubblegum Mac one,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what's in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like clone only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Type, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have blue cocky, which is a new name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan came up for the sherb cream pie cross
to the blueberry and cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty stoked on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fat, chunky sherb, a little louder
than normal sherb.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, like, I mean, there's a cut out
there called blue sherb that everybody was
[SPEAKER_01]: all stoked on when it came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, wow, this sounds pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then tried it and it wasn't really
blue at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of wanted to reimagine that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blues for me, which is the white runs
blueberry and cross, which, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: smells like it's a lot smaller yielding
version of the sherb cream pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the the Trop Dosey blueberry and
cross, which really is like a taggy
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant cookies blueberry and cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, it's it's kind of leaning
into the hive crowd a little bit to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: get some injection of interest into what
we do in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as it were, like a thousand said,
maybe a Trojan horse style attack on bring
[SPEAKER_01]: them into the old by working in the new,
I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just so I have to point out,
like, how good blue cocky is for sherb pie
[SPEAKER_02]: blue hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, Dan, you literally just came up
with that like five minutes ago.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how my fucked up brain works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue cocky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good in a cream pie and all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we got we have what is it goat
farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a blue dream work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he dropped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see if we got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he only wrote the names on the
list to spread them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's not it either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is the goat farm drop?
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's about that dream killer dream
killer is going to be what the P 91,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the sack one sack one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's one cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So solo assassin number one, O.G.,
which is a kind of help for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really, really dank old O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way better than O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never needed to stake it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: and Terps, almost like Irene, but it's
just a way better growing plant than any O
.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the Santa Cruz dog shit,
which is the dog shit cross to electric
[SPEAKER_01]: Boogaloo, whatever you want to call it,
cross to the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are all stems for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blueberry in process are all red
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yanking out like a weasel here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got waking life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what that one is local.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the T.C.P.K.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the pure kush.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your kush blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have wet dreams, which is the
green craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are going to be dropped this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been shucking so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't really gotten around to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to make the deadline for
releasing the blueberry in cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those would already be out, except for the
fact I'm waiting for my printer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have the mango haze drop from
high and low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have those in yet, but it's
going to be, I believe, green crack,
[SPEAKER_01]: mango haze, dog shit, mango haze,
nothing there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys know KMD mango haze and the mango
haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there an AP mango haze?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you did AP mango haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember seeing that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a I think I want to say EB.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all regular stuff, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a few different regular seed
drops and one FEM seed drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for my next drop, it's going to be
probably I think we're going to do the
[SPEAKER_01]: blue in cross FEM, but we're going to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to see where it takes us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the hopes anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can never bet the farm on that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's another round of blue drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, another round of blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another blue drop after this right
to come that we may not leak yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, which one's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A5 mango haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully that will work and come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, G.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also have the TGA process
coming soon, which is like the epitome of
[SPEAKER_01]: something that I said I'd never do and
never say never.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be all the newer bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think better moms that should have been
crossed to space, dude, personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be coming very soon,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are insane drops, by the way,
like all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're pretty good.
Stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have enough space or money for
this shit either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The agenda.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we can start off with some of the
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first one, which we've had before,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's go over it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So diggy effects asks, I'd love to hear
more about mother plant maintenance,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in solo cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can expand that to say mother
plants in smaller containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could start with this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mother plants in smaller containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main thing you're going to run into is
like mold, PM bugs, because you have a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more leaf in a smaller area, because if
you're using the stuff in a smaller area,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're topping your training.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're cramming as much as you can into a
tiny scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, IPM has to be on track.
[SPEAKER_01]: Air movement has to be on track.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times people like to use,
and I know this is like absurd nowadays,
[SPEAKER_01]: but T fives lower light.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a smaller environment to
induce like slower growing, as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: like decreasing health for slower growing,
decrease the light for slower growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of our big tricks back in the
day, keeping, you know, a hundred moms in
[SPEAKER_01]: a small space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, like, like raising lights and
lowering lights as they go up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that was the main thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what else you guys got.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say probably the biggest thing is
the light thing that Matt mentioned in my,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least in my situation, because that
helps like mitigate how much growth you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, once you start getting that many
moms, it just becomes a lot to manage.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also like me, in my case, I also do
cocoa only.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to water and feed like every
single watering.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, if I do, my plants are going to
fall over because like the weight of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant is just like too, too much for the
kind of the width of the pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also do racks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Racks help me a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, I mean, you could double your area
with that easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, just keep your plant,
your mom's like well fed, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: like well watered.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a question about this as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any sense in, with mothers,
like, do you keep the lights as intense as
[SPEAKER_02]: you would for plants that you're growing
out to crop?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I give them less light just in general,
like less intense light.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about feeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time they need a lot, they need
heavy food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're getting the same feed as
my like plants and flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I don't, I don't really reduce
diet or change diet for them too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to keep it consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kyle's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Constantly taking cuts, constantly taking
cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another good way to keep it low.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's essentially the same thing as
topping in many sense or many sense the
[SPEAKER_01]: same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same achieves the same thing as
topping, but it's a huge important part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the process, especially if you're keeping
a lot of moms and you're doing like a
[SPEAKER_01]: strain library, keep stuff alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to take lots of cuts because shit
dies as you keep them smaller.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that turnover just helps keep them
small too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if you're cutting it every four
to six weeks and restarting it,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're going to constantly pretty
much have like a six or seven inch clone
[SPEAKER_00]: up to like a foot or two tall,
and then it immediately goes back to a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a ton of work, but that's how
I do it or try to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm behind right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some clone trays that are like
two feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was another trick I used to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I mean, I don't know if I
recommend this or not, or don't recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the 10 by 20 plastic Monte trays
or whatever, like the thick ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: I put load those up with perlite and I
would keep essentially like a hempy bucket
[SPEAKER_01]: for a lack of a better term, just perlite
and water and keep the clones in that,
[SPEAKER_01]: or not water, but a feed and constantly
water it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with it is if it's all
different strains, they overgrow each
[SPEAKER_01]: other real fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some get like two feet tall, some stay
four inches, but I was able to keep things
[SPEAKER_01]: in there for like two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes if I needed, it would look like
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would, it would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I've got a tray of 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like two months in the tray,
two feet tall, fucking watering it twice a
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, I don't have time to
fucking pot these up yet, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going in next.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've saved whole libraries that way,
just like backing them up that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like a emergency scenario where
if you're feeling extra lazy or having
[SPEAKER_01]: very little room, it'll work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just essentially what it would be is
a Monte tray perlite, and then water.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those skeleton trays, set clones in
that are open, just set the clones in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, rock wool, more perlite,
water that shit in and they'll go bananas
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, I've seen shit take off
the flower in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and you can get growed in of any
size too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could like really easily just get
like the three inch cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, they're kind of tall too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could fit like 18 of those in
one of those 10 by 20s and just like keep
[SPEAKER_00]: a little mini mom like that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was putting like 70,
even when I plugged it was just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I'm going to have to pop this down
like twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nuts trying to do the 72 count.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, but the tray was off at that
point, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was, it was hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do mini cuts in the,
you remember when Oasis cubes had the
[SPEAKER_00]: ledgers and they were like 102 count and
the little plastic insert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to cram little like three inch
cuts in those and like they took an extra
[SPEAKER_00]: week to like really get established.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, if they're all just like
stuff you would have thrown away and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could sell clones back then that was
fucking great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to take the working out of system
for my like tiny, tiny, shamefully tiny
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had like a got like a one foot by
one foot by like two foot cabinet in which
[SPEAKER_02]: I there's like a shelf in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd stuffed like 25 plants in there
crazy, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just to like keep my shit though,
like I cut two full trays just for like
[SPEAKER_00]: the dozen things I'm holding onto.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like to take five or six of each,
you know, and suddenly you have like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just throwing them all away,
you know, and you do throw a lot of way
[SPEAKER_01]: that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it sucks, but yeah, it hurts every
time you're like, Oh, this could be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like any one thing from an
ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a pound of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just throwing it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy, my buddy Chris Asaro down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's he does really nice living water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's I guess it would be living
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's he has worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: He feeds water through that through the
worm castings that go through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think fish shit in it somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, like aquaponic thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's very vermeponic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's growing some beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Punchy plants that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works really fucking well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard the phrase living water,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to try.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to try growing plants out of
your tanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the newts be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are those little fuckers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a pussy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be a pussy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want newt water, newt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro, that's my compost tea right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it works like with.
[SPEAKER_01]: With fish and just fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Local told me that he has like a shot of
that water every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes it for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for the gut biome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Gage Green that used to drink
Willard's water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember Willard's water, Dan?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy did some weird shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, he was like it was mud water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although he did say one thing that has
stuck with me for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember one time that dude from Gage
Green was like, well, I mean, just he was
[SPEAKER_00]: like arguing in favor of veganism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's just like, well, think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to a vegan restaurant,
you're probably going to want to fuck a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go to an Applebee's,
how many of those people do you really
[SPEAKER_00]: want to fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, point taken, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: With me for like five years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like kicks of hairy armpits.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that's what my book of poetry
would be right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the live stream, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't say that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think that was that was an
actual quote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason, whatever his name is, the younger
one, the older one is the one that was a
[SPEAKER_01]: freak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Asian dude with the super long
hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's that's Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the younger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came later.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old dude, though, he was I think it
was maybe fulvic water or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was foul as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like Kava Kava or something,
you know, like mud water.
Crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only crazy people drink that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably just as bad as like the
people who drink silver and turn blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could be like me and just spill
like twenty five to fifty dollars worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: silver on your floor at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, it isn't me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stained the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I'm moving out in three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think from new blue drops match to turn
blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to get a eye to make a
picture of Matt with a blueberry head and
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: My head is pretty fat again right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all blimped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've like done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've like insert your image into it to
give it a starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like it just yeah, someone with more
talent needs to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just too beautiful for to turn blue
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Indo here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Indo could probably try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a work, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next question was, oh, this is an
interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This came up in the breeding series as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone use keep notes, basically
notebooks for plants tracking data in
[SPEAKER_02]: general?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any tips?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got mine like right here,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm so unorganized.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never kept notes on anything,
which is why I'm also starting to get
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a lab notebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put all your favorite stickers on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's from like 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see the stickers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see the stickers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 is on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you know it's old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any good bands?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any laid bands?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's the trim scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the barbershop in Humboldt that my
wife used to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got our General Hydro, Six Rivers
Brewery, more General Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots Organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was working at the Hydro shop
when I got this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you got stickers like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Clonex, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: More Roots Organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Track 7 Brewing in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit's fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Fluence, the most dead LED company of
all time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make good shit, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first gen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I have a little table of
contents up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just do this like you would a lab
notebook in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's some fucking reading notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get this centered?
[SPEAKER_00]: Reading notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else we got in here?
[SPEAKER_03]: You could be a TA at a university,
Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this one's the developmental
cytology of the resin glands of humulus
[SPEAKER_00]: lupus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was reading weird shit at this point,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dumb as fuck, I guarantee you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Merlin and Clark, 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was when I first read the Cannabis
Evolution and Ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Designs for clone racks and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Evolution and Ethnobotany is like a real
college textbook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that one's dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is literally like me designing my
first tissue culture lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the phases and like different
equipment I need and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get that?
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remembered.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I do it is like the lab
notebook's gridded out, it's numbered
[SPEAKER_00]: pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can like here's where I designed a
quality index for grading pounds when I
[SPEAKER_00]: worked in LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grading pounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because we had to like grade pounds
and know what to sell them for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, it's my whole process of
like, giving it a like a score basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so when buyers like try to push back
on it, be like, no, I actually have a
[SPEAKER_00]: system as opposed to just like,
this is a cool one, a little like flood
[SPEAKER_00]: tray design for like a rolling rack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like two little reservoirs
with pumps and like returns and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan's gonna auction off this notebook
later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here's all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the clone list I had in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Walto G, Straubana, Sour Patch
Kids, Forbidden Fruit, Cement Shoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: Vienna OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when I first got down to LA and so
we had all this weird shit, Purple Punch,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dosey Doe, two different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Ultraviolence.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was all from that cult classics,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of like moment in the sun
there in like 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Super Glue, Crazy Glue, Sour Straubana
Sherbet, Sherbet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the green sherb.
[SPEAKER_00]: G44, G41, G33, Bubba, Girl Scout Cookie,
Kosher Kush, Buckeye.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was actually a cool little purple
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever come across that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked cool, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a black rose hybrid of some
sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple Jack, SFV, Strawberry Fields,
Sunset Sherb, Golden Cobra.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't actually remember that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: King Louie, FaZe OG, Wi-Fi OG,
Durbin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta have Wi-Fi, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this reminds me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this one dude, Jimmy,
down in LA and he ran a bunch of grow
[SPEAKER_00]: houses and stuff and he had really good
cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had this Sour Power OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: No clue what the fuck it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: M1, 2, and 7.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Locals Cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what up, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got Endo back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I had the Trace Dog at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Silverback.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Silverback was like an OG Gorilla Glue
hybrid that was super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan, what about notes when you were
actually tracking plants and how they were
[SPEAKER_02]: doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember you actually showed me a
spreadsheet once as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so here's an early one.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2018 breeding notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had the clone name, a few little
short notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this was probably the first time I
was flowering this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this was a run from Bio Vortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was his Orange is the New Banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Bio Vortex, one of the few
people from HSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude, he's a fucking really chill
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met up with him once.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's a really good and he's on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He takes his time with shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of have to know him to get his
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of cool too, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I met up with him in person and he
had this cool chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this bag and he's pulling out all
these baggies and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like, oh shit, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like visiting a seed bank in
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to be confused with HSC, who has the
best marketing campaign on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else have we got in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's it, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, here's me like mapping out profits
or potential profits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know Dan's organized as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you guys organized like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, dude, it's gotten to the point
where I just throw plants and flower all
[SPEAKER_03]: the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just keep track of when I threw it into
flower and that's about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like everything I've grown,
I can reference it in my brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know where you're writing all the
DMs and pictures on Discord and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are kind of notes as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in some sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use mine a lot, actually, where I go
back onto IG and I'm like, oh shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I remember that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at the point where I use monkey at zoo
as my strain index.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a list of every single strain I've
ever made from day one that he keeps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to reference that because someone
will ask me something and I'll be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't fucking know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool that someone has that
because I don't have that in my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brain isn't so good anymore,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a reliable tool anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about you, Thousand?
[SPEAKER_02]: For notes, I think I also tend to rely on
IG.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first started growing, the forums
were good for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, you had your own thread and you
could obviously keep a lot of notes in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And IG, like Dan was saying, it's not bad,
but it's not easy to search.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to manually scroll through
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not ideal either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideally, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could probably use a spreadsheet if I
wanted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just I'm still not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my memory is good for strains and
what they were like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty accurate for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My own strain names less accurate,
like what I called something at certain
[SPEAKER_01]: points.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like if someone tells me the cross,
I can tell them exactly what it was like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that much that strain names are
harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're making seeds, that's
probably a good thing to keep a list of.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one for a long time when
Speaksleazy took over the website,
[SPEAKER_01]: they deleted all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was kind of it unless someone
finds a way to go back in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to him for the help with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say that when I first started
growing, one thing that helped me was
[SPEAKER_02]: actually recording mistakes that I was
making in the earlier runs, because then
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing happened last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll try not to do that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, most of that's internalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, at some point I was tracking
like fuck ups, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can't imagine you not keeping
notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is organized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super into archiving shit for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you are, too, Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you do keep a lot of stuff,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not notes, but you know,
you're into archiving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep collections of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at what's behind that right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm watching to see if my Hasbulla
autograph on eBay goes for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm the only old man that still
does an IRL in the hand, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it gets you back better,
back into the mindset you were when you
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing that stuff, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like instantly that took me back,
you know, six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like, oh, I know what I was
thinking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the things that I thought were
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like what I know better now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's a really good like
reflective tool, too, to see like how far
[SPEAKER_00]: you've come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what do we got next?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so next we have a bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a couple of questions from
Screwston.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Dan has a lot of experience
reversing plants, local gaining it,
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you talk about some common mistakes
outside of the typical trying to reverse a
[SPEAKER_02]: single plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, Dan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll catch up at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's all of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe local, you go first, local.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because local is fresh, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I actually I just did my first one
not too long ago, so it's still pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the first piece of advice is don't
reverse a big ass plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like my sweet pea by nature fucking
just grows insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like an insane rates and then to do more
than one plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never want to put all your eggs in one
basket.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then another thing would be timing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of got to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it's going to throw balls,
you know, like I didn't know about when it
[SPEAKER_03]: would, and it just kind of did around two
and a half weeks is when I started seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: balls, but then they didn't really open
till a few weeks after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like the timing thing is still a bit
confusing to me, but it's all like trial
[SPEAKER_03]: and error.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I feel like it's like literally all
mistakes until you do, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: half a dozen or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you kind of get your bearings a
little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I agree with everything that Luke
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like timing is super important
because if you spray too much,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't go well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spray too high a concentration,
it doesn't go well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spray too low a concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like knowing what you're working
with and kind of documenting that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was Dick to the wind when I
started my reversal journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone just told me like,
yeah, mix a few ounces of this liquid with
[SPEAKER_00]: a few ounces of this liquid and do it in
this order.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had no idea the concentrations I was
using and it did not work most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took me like three years really,
because I wasn't buying commercial sprays
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of like figure out where I
actually wanted to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like some stuff's easy too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was doing some hemp work and CBD
work and that shit reverses really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so you get this false sense of
confidence that same thing with auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reversed autos after that and did some
of that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that shit is super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: At least this, the low rider stuff that I
was working with was like just went every
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, then you get into doing
multiple different types of clones and you
[SPEAKER_00]: start tripping over your deck and you're
just like, Oh, what the fuck happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: This has worked every single time that I
did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why isn't it working now?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you kind of realize like,
and that happens over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, okay, well I don't like know
what I'm doing at all actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, it was once I started
documenting concentrations, blending
[SPEAKER_00]: different concentrations and like doing
kind of just like basic trials like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I was like, okay, well this is all
almost always too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is damaging the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's counterproductive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like the concentration and the
frequency is too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, timing is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentration is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, knowing the plant that you
have is also like obviously part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's like, if you don't know it's
like general flower rate, then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably going to be thrown off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if it takes a long time to initiate
flower for a normal female flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's probably going to take longer during
the reversal too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you may be doing extra weeks
of sprays that you don't do with an eight
[SPEAKER_00]: or nine week common cut, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, I'll toss in one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the thing that I probably get
asked even by pros like that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: reversing seeds, some feminine seeds is,
is the most important thing is patience
[SPEAKER_01]: because like, like on my bottle,
it says wait 20 or days, 24 days until you
[SPEAKER_01]: see any sort of reversal going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually by 24th day, you're like,
what the fuck it's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's usually about the time it
starts to happen when you start freaking
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's usually 24 days before you see
any initiation, any of the common clone
[SPEAKER_01]: types out there that aren't hemp,
um, before you even see balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there out, it's usually like
two and a half weeks, two weeks until it
[SPEAKER_01]: throbs and matures, if it's going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It, I want to say it took about four to
five weeks to see any sacks like wanting
[SPEAKER_03]: to open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like Luke was saying too,
numbers is big.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want multiple small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say at least two if you're doing one
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then usually I'll do a second
backup variety that I usually have some
[SPEAKER_00]: more confidence in or have like reversed
before and kind of know it's whole shtick
[SPEAKER_00]: and deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, yeah, like you having a backup
plan for if that reversal fails is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: key because otherwise you're like
flowering stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want flower from necessarily
even feeding it differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're just kind of off at that point
and you're like, well, I'm either going to
[SPEAKER_00]: kill all these plants and start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you had that backup plan,
then you're like, well, I'm still happy
[SPEAKER_00]: with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy that I made this and I didn't
waste my time and electrical and space and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think also another thing too is like
when you're flowering males, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you kind of see a lot of the flowers open,
you know, at one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like in reversals, it's very like,
you know, sporadic, like a fuel open here,
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but granted that's, you know,
only with the one plant I reversed,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was sweet peas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what the fuck do I know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it tends to be correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see a lot of things open.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sweet pea looked real good though,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the next one, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, but sometimes you get it to perfectly
reverse, but the pollen is just like not
[SPEAKER_00]: viable enough or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sometimes pollen drop doesn't mean
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like if you're trying to do an S one,
then especially not, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like when I did that AJ sour reversal,
like it barely made any seeds on itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made like 20, but on everything else,
it was perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what also is common is like
getting the plant to then take the pollen,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see all the pistols die off,
all that stuff or whatever you call it,
[SPEAKER_01]: stigma die off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, then you see seeds forming and
then they won't mature because of either
[SPEAKER_01]: plant health, whatever else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I saw that even this last time with
the blueberry and cross some, one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants is in lower health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the seed started forming, but they just
ended up in a lot of immature seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's not always guaranteed even if
you see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you guys fucked around with the,
uh, throwing them back under veg light
[SPEAKER_00]: after like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works pretty well for me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, I was told like to expect a
higher proportion of like malformed and
[SPEAKER_00]: white seed, but like they all came out
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lighter color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it wasn't like sometimes it could be
gray modeled, but I do, I've gotten some
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing seats doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I did one round of, um, I don't know
the, the fake Irene the first time the
[SPEAKER_01]: bonnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second time I did that,
I did it with three veg and made seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: with the same bonnet now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it made some of the most like healthy,
robust, brown tiger stripe seeds I've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being able to hold them side by side
and look at them was pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm just freeing up flower space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like not spending all that time and having
that dedicated space for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight to 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a follow-up question from
Skrustin, which is, um, I imagine for both
[SPEAKER_02]: of you, um, any common threads that you
see with plants that are difficult to
[SPEAKER_02]: reverse?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say not always.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, cause like, like Girl Scout cookies
reverse is just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of the most dense plants
there is in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not, not now anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess there's hybrids of it at
the, at the time that the Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies were super dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember thinking when I went into
that, that some of the more dense plants
[SPEAKER_01]: or some of the ones I always had the
hardest time with because of the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: clusters and how the four clusters set up
for reversals, it would stack in so tight,
[SPEAKER_01]: they wouldn't mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one reverses really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, same with Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reverses really well and has very,
very dense, uh, flower stacking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have found that a lot of the more
loose, airy types, like, uh, older,
[SPEAKER_01]: what you'd call Sativa dominant strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they tend to reverse really well,
but again, not always.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not, um, there's no hard set fast
rules yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've, what I've noticed with all the
ones that I've tried and failed to reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple times is they kind of fall into
different categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on like what branch of the
general family tree they lie on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the AJ, the sour stuff, I feel like
it's just self incompatible at some
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic level, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one type versus like the
Skittles just doesn't make pollen sacks
[SPEAKER_00]: and doesn't drop pollen, you know,
and the pollen super low, like super low,
[SPEAKER_00]: not very viable, like when you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just, um, I feel like there's
different reasons why things don't work
[SPEAKER_00]: out in reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, for like the really hard to
reverse plants and like they, I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just different genetic, like walls that
you hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and those will probably lie
similar with the families of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, anything else on reversals?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess here's another one that maybe some
people, it might be, not common sense to
[SPEAKER_03]: some people, but like, there's no need to
spray the leaves when you're doing
[SPEAKER_03]: reversals, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, boy armpits.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's just like one thing I've,
you know, again, just being like a newer
[SPEAKER_01]: person that that's what haunted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spray them armpits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cause the leaves, they just end up
getting super damaged after a few sprays
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway, even if you lightly dose spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, like with the spray that I've
done, I'm playing with like after the
[SPEAKER_00]: third spray, like there's usually a decent
amount of damage that you'll see on the
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like the higher concentration
and then the different additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, you know, it's just something
to keep in mind that it's like the more of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant you spray, the more damage
you're causing to it, which is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a stress response that may not work
in your favor.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And screw instance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last question was more general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what plants are you guys excited,
most excited about currently?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess they're cream pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're cream pie because you get to call
it kukaki.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm keeping that name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'll say interpret that whatever way
you want, whether it's like a plant that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're actually growing or something that
you are interested in working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of, any of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to get into some, uh,
electric boogaloo crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely first up on the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some blueberry, the blue bonnet F
twos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going in on the next one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then what else?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some more stuff from high and
lonesome that I need to check out,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I definitely want to get in on the
mango hay stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have to, I've never flowered any
like real types of haze like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also need to hit up Pico for some of the
nightcap, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was his, the sandalwood one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to try that out too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, that's like my next venture is
like getting into real long flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That isn't just like sour or Ken mango
haze is really good, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree that 2009 was my first grow of
mango haze and it was one of my first real
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences with haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, after that I had the piss stuff,
but they were very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some similarities between both
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and I'm tossing that Jesus OG in again
for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get my tea, get my tea lean on again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought the flowers not quite as nuanced
like, um, but the extracts are fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to see if it'll dry sift too,
because I feel like that would be really
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing, but I think it'll be a cool
breeding tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of interested in like a blueberry
turpentine combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Local.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you allowed to talk about?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty fucking excited for like the
dog shit, like the act or the electric
[SPEAKER_03]: Google or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's, it's probably one of my favorite
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you mean the clone itself,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the clone itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I got to smoke it once, uh,
at the last party we had, uh, bittersweet
[SPEAKER_03]: SD grew it, uh, super tasty weed,
really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you know, the EB API is always from H
and L.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always excited on that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, sweet P as always.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm actually growing out the,
uh, P 91 S one for the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really fucking exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's like, you know, I've seen,
in the double digits of like sweet P,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, so it's, it's pretty fucking
cool to see like the parental gen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and the cut that I have doesn't smell
exactly like the one that, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: bitter used.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but there was a cut that I really
liked that smelled exactly like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, his is definitely more like true to
peanut smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, mine, it has it there, but it has
like, I guess like a soapy and sensey
[SPEAKER_03]: weird thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like super clean tasting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how to describe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I haven't picked that smell up on
his cut yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a bit of a random interjection,
but we're going to talk to sub Rob,
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I learned for the first time
looking at some of the IC mag,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, San Diego finest threads that,
uh, P 91 is Poe 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the stories for the Poe class
of 91 is where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as opposed to like any interstate or
anything like that, it's, it's supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: be Poe class of 91, but it's not,
it's just one of the stories that goes
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not confirmed for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then I'm also, um, have the power
way that San Diego, the power way,
[SPEAKER_02]: power way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, my bad guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not from Scandinavia,
so yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at weird Arctic circle people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I was also going to say that 56 day
headband, uh, OG is also really fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that should look good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've, you mean OG Kush?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, to me it's SFV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's SFV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think hip hill renamed SFV and,
and call it 56.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a totally late term that someone
kept using on our show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, no, regardless, it's,
it smells really dank, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it a lot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a damn good cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you also, you, you shared a pic just,
just before, uh, bandaid haze destroyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, can we talk about that one now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was more so like a personal
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, did old song send you some of the
destroyer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, no, that was from another buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can all talk about this and,
uh, yeah, I just don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like I haven't talked to her,
you know, but it's, it's just for my
[SPEAKER_03]: personal collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personal fondlings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use the long fans to tickle my butthole.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does it a little better than the broad
broad leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Better come on my fishing trip,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get in trouble, just throw me under
the bus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, if, uh, no, I mean, I just,
it was unexpected.
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was unrepairable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I'm just here to like make content,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just YouTube, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't take us serious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, sadly that's just for fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, nothing's coming of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, don't even breathing hard yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't, don't even get your hopes up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone just forget, you know,
men in black, the fucking memory thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just forget that we talked about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Edit, edit, edit.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, man, I mean, you know, after your
massive outdoor grow, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: are there any other, any exciting,
any plants that you're excited?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to be remaking bubble berry
this year, year, and, and, but I'm going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have to do better planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, obviously like the bug factor is
insane outdoors, like looking insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an ad Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we have white flies ripped up the
wazoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just so good to have the green
aphids down there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have, we have everything you could
imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an ad crop problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the farmers all spray around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gets kicked in every direction,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's not their direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if I'll be doing outdoor
this year or move it back to indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had, I have so much stuff to move,
but I need to make more bubble berry
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's finally gone, almost gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I, it's hard to keep like being
excited about working blueberry because I
[SPEAKER_01]: know everybody's so sick of it,
but I haven't found the end of what I
[SPEAKER_01]: love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like every time I like the blueberry in
cross is exactly what I wanted for the
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a completed completed thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, um, but like there,
some of the hybrids are really red.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like want to go there, but it's like,
I keep breeding for blue and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrids, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, it's, it's hard to keep doing that and
keep a viable company going as I've
[SPEAKER_01]: learned, but it's, it's what I'm excited
about still.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't, I haven't moved off from the
blue breeding just cause I understand it
[SPEAKER_01]: so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the longer I work with it,
the better I understand it, the more
[SPEAKER_01]: predictable the breeding becomes and the
less I want to move away because I can
[SPEAKER_01]: predict a blue breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the whole goal of everything from
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just say, I don't think there's any
shortage of excitement for blue stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least not in like these circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are talking about it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been absent other than what blueberry
muffins has been the only blueberry in the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been a, and like, I don't really
like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the muffin turps are like not like
it's, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice for the first time, but like,
it's not the blueberry that I miss and
[SPEAKER_00]: like, that I used to get as a teenager.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, yeah, I prefer like the blueberry
jam stuff that the on it throws.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I met with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there were, there was a few years
there where there was a lot of downtime
[SPEAKER_01]: and nobody was like crawling up my ass
from blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had that before blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, no, not this one,
but like how many times have people heard
[SPEAKER_01]: that in Canada?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not, you know, so it's taken
years and years of enough people trying it
[SPEAKER_01]: for it to build its own.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're there and now stuff selling out,
you know, so it's like, I got to go back
[SPEAKER_01]: and remake it, but the top, by the point
it's remade are people still going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always how this game goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in those right though,
I think you need to do blueberry permanent
[SPEAKER_00]: marker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, after someone just told me Mac
daddy's in-house, I just puked in my mouth
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, on this note, I do have a
blueberry and cross girl that's just
[SPEAKER_02]: started flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am excited about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to see how you like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you do a blue cookies?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done like four or five, four or five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I mean, on the reason that so the
very first blue cookies cut came out of
[SPEAKER_01]: our, um, what was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, uh, original diesel BX one
cross to cookie berry, which was the forum
[SPEAKER_01]: cut riot berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what that blue cookies cut that
midnight farms had.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was from the, like not the
original, but the first cross of the
[SPEAKER_01]: original.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't as blueberry as I wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't have been my selection for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the one that went around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, we did a lot of cookie berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, GKB.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the most preferred cut of the
mung of all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I've ever been with a group
among people, like they're like trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get me to grow blue cookies or they like
have blue cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I've seen some really good,
yeah, I've actually seen some really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I remember some kid gave me like
eight bag seeds of a blue cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really good that I got to see the
weed of, and it came in like a little
[SPEAKER_00]: Marlboro cellophane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was pissed because that was really
good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's not blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I would've wanted, like that's like
an OG KB blueberry blue bonnet or
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry I X would be really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The OG KB, we did that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did a back cross to OG KB with
OG KB cross to Dan has some Dan definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: had some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you, whatever you made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you sent me some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kristen's just saying, um, yeah,
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kristen's grown some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, the OG KB BX one was
awesome, but it was so blue dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: still, which was when I really,
that was early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was still really learning like how
dominant blue bonnet bread at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's not a true, what I would call
a BX one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's no good perfect OG KB
representation sands blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a lot of area now, but it does
exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, from Pascal's law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like a very philosophical
political question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your biggest hopes for the future
of cannabis and what are your worst fears?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've realized some of my worst
fears already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, I don't think it's really
going to get better anytime soon,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, I'll be, let me start this off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be real basic here and just say,
uh, it'd be nice to have full
[SPEAKER_02]: decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, obviously like no regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, don't you know that's what drives
price is that bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to me, that's an obvious answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, like true decriminalization,
because there's been a lot of studies that
[SPEAKER_00]: have shown that like in certain minority
youth categories that, uh, arrests are up
[SPEAKER_00]: under legalization in places like LA and,
um, they're still getting like every day
[SPEAKER_01]: in the news here, people are getting
popped where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, it's not really true,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think a lot of people are like,
yeah, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, but at least nobody's going to prison
for this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, you still do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are like the wrong color skin and
you have more than an out, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like it's, uh, do you guys know
about Germany's, uh, news?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that they are doing something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember if it's like a full,
someone told me they're doing right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have some weird rec setup that
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think it's actually pretty
good, but again, yeah, someone,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe someone in the chat knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I just have no trust anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like any kind of, any kind of country
attached to the United States in any,
[SPEAKER_01]: any type of way is going to go our,
our route with the legalization,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's Australia, whether,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like any place remotely attached to the UN
even probably will have, have issues like
[SPEAKER_01]: we did where it's just corporatocracy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my hopes for the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fish from said it's legal now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know it's quote unquote legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just trying to figure out like,
what that actually means.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says four plants each.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's still restrictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's not legal to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember for me to hold clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's four plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember that the person was talking
about it was a four plants of which you
[SPEAKER_01]: can only yield X amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was such a low amount that it was,
it didn't make sense for even four plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like four ounces over the total of
four plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, fish farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're talking about is like having
no restrictions, like, like treated like a
[SPEAKER_02]: tomato pie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like legal, legal, not, not legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to rain on Germany's parade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's still something, I guess,
but like even in a regulated system,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could have something that's like a
farmer's market that kind of replicates
[SPEAKER_00]: our pop-up shows and like has a structure
behind it and licensing and fees that go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the state and taxes collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it would usurp their system because
they can't provide that level of quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like right now, if you go and meet up with
a bunch of these guys running big
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, they, I think that they are so
delusional.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've convinced themselves that this
shit's not mids, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they see what's on the landscape and
they see all these other rich kids growing
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty weed and they're just like,
Oh, well I'm actually crushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine's better than theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the right yield more than them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is top shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, if the market's
baseline is shit, then like your weeds one
[SPEAKER_00]: step above shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like none of us are getting good weed and
exactly screw their taxes and regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm back to like fully just like
cowboy, like just like, I don't give a
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm going to do what I'm going to do
and like come and fucking get me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just like even put my face out
here and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, Oh, well like what are you
serious?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, like how much shit I could
say about the shit that I like go happens
[SPEAKER_00]: legally every day in this state,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That you guys willfully overlook because
you're getting paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: The department of cannabis control,
everything that California has going on is
[SPEAKER_00]: an absolute joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the rest of the company
country is emulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so an imitating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just like, to me, it's just a,
and until I can show up with my fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: pickup truck with a couple of pounds of
weed with their fucking state stamp on it
[SPEAKER_00]: and shit, and I can pitch it to you man to
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man to woman, whatever and fucking a
farmer's market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then like, I can actually sell you that
weed and convince you that it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is why it costs more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's better, but they've
completely taken that out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not even possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to me, that's like willful
deception to the larger market that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't know better in part by the state
and lobbyists that do know better that
[SPEAKER_00]: represent these companies, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just big business corporate
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't really have much optimism,
but we can still do our own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like small collectives of people that are
just friends that grow weed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like exactly like the discord community is
like, that's what we need more of because
[SPEAKER_00]: then you don't have to go and buy weed
from the fucking shop and get charged
[SPEAKER_00]: through the ass on taxes and like get kind
of shitty weed, a very limited scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like a union in a sorts or
collective.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's like, this is our shit man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what it is about people
getting together and not being fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: completely greedy bastards.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the hardest part with humans
because it's like when bad humans see good
[SPEAKER_01]: things happening between a group of people
where everything is all equal,
[SPEAKER_01]: it looks like something they can prey on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like always the first to wreck
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the hardest part is just
knowing how to just let the threats in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've met a lot of these rich dudes
and like they tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if morality is a
question of what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the moral thing to do is
whichever thing makes the most money for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's almost what it seems like to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like seriously, like it's any time you
get people that are basically middlemen,
[SPEAKER_00]: financial middlemen trying to squeeze
dollars out of something else that someone
[SPEAKER_00]: else is producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we go out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is that like you go and you work,
you make production.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get paid for said production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's so many people in our economy
that are just a ring in a few pennies out
[SPEAKER_00]: of every little thing that someone else is
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get enough of that,
you can make a fuck ton of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when you start making shitty
decisions where it's like I talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: this all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife hates fucking hearing about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm always talking about how like a
business nowadays, like a corporation's
[SPEAKER_00]: obligation is to the shareholders,
not to the actual customer anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we keep getting things
where it's like, well, why is the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of like every experience in retail and
fast food and everything else going down?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like because someone else is
ringing dollars out of it and someone else
[SPEAKER_00]: is having to make up that gap by like over
out, like giving people too many hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it all ties together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our economic model that's broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to show this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember this guy came in last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not old enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, Denali is my fucking dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was in the right place at the right
time to have made that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want Denali to be my dad as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll adopt him.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a good dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Local.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your philosophy, local?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your take on the political
situation right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like the last person to ask about the
politics.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know, I just don't want to get
in trouble for growing plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's that's really it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the less political side.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, fuck the man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say it with me now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck the man.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the less political side,
I think like for me, it's kind of seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: where like the culture is going to go,
because like, I don't know, I believe that
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of people my age are just like lost
causes, dude.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, just kind of curious to see where
it's going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, fuck the man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just it's hard to find anything
optimistic to say about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, at this point, we haven't seen
really any upswings in anything positive,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion, for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The events that we used to have were made
not even say amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were cool, like an old Emerald Cup
and stuff like that, where it's at now
[SPEAKER_01]: versus even five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hot shit mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: No disrespect to the Emerald Cup people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the it's a lot of people can't
participate anymore that were the driving
[SPEAKER_01]: force behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's lost popularity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, I mean, laws, period, price of
cannabis, us being able to support our
[SPEAKER_01]: family doing what we've always done,
like all that's changed, none for the
[SPEAKER_01]: better quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: What positive is there to say more people
smoking?
[SPEAKER_01]: But who gives a fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like quality over quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like quality people over quantity of
people is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's lost the sense of community in
many ways in that respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not everybody listens to the
Grateful Dead, granted, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there was some sort of community
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like that's just all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have to say that more and more random
people that just casually smoke weed have
[SPEAKER_00]: been hitting me up for seeds and clones
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been going out of my way to like
literally any person that's just an
[SPEAKER_00]: acquaintance in my day to day life.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're like, hey, man, I heard you
really like weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like I'll give them like
fucking hundred seeds of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a couple different things,
like 10 seeds, like 10 different things or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like try and spark that interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, you can just do this for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to get hit so hard now after
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come meet me, come meet me in real life
and then we'll talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been, I don't know, whenever I
have like less, like I'm always like
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do too many things at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, I would love to have like a
thing or once a month, we all met up at
[SPEAKER_00]: some dude's ranch or some shit and just
got high and fucking drank a few beers and
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about weed and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to have that in my community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't have the time in my life to
like structure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like trying to like be self-employed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like fucking do all a million
different things at once, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, but anyway, like maybe
at one point, you know, more people need
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that kind of stuff because it's
cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to like actually hang out with
people that like have like interest
[SPEAKER_00]: because weed and being a weed nerd is kind
of like, it's a bubble in a bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a burrito full of burritos,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people don't get it when they're
like, oh, so you really like weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, yeah, let's not talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The waters are too deep for a casual first
conversation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think I would just echo what
lots of people have said.
[SPEAKER_02]: My hope is that it's just currently a very
immature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at a very immature stage and like
the, you know, like beer, it will get,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, to a better place.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably as optimistic a spin as I
can put on it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The weed swap meat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get that HLV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that Pascal's law,
I always thought it was Pascal's law.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why, but Pascal's law makes
me think I think it's a play on both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of the things that I noticed he
asked in this other one, it says for
[SPEAKER_01]: future viral threats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that wasn't even a part of the process
in my brain right now as we were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about the future cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's a major fucking issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Local like this is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: As in AIDS.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's yeah, it's like the STD of of the
weed world.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: HLV really does show up places.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my own trading, it's abundant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's I mean, it's yeah, it's it's one of
the costs you pay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes shit doesn't even look sick,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you wouldn't even know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then other things you're like,
like, yeah, that's one thousand percent
[SPEAKER_03]: sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I can visually identify something's
wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, you know, you got to like
understand how it transmits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, you know, exchanging runoff,
you know, like, you know, you want to have
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody on like a riser or something or
on their each individual saucer so that
[SPEAKER_03]: the runoff doesn't touch the bottom of
another plant because that's how it'll
[SPEAKER_03]: contract it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want them to exchange fluids,
you know, xylem, phloem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that that too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's just like, I mean,
yeah, every every little step kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: counts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if, you know, say you forgot to
bleach a pair of scissors and you didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: realize it, you know, like you may have
infected something, you may have not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the most important thing to
nail home is that some plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we're noticing, like they may not
look sick at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So visually, it's not something you can
necessarily detect visually.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them can carry it and don't
necessarily show any of the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have those in your garden,
they can infect other plants that really
[SPEAKER_01]: show the disease real fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really is about either being super
clean, only popping from seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: not taking in clone onlys and playing that
game or constantly being able to have
[SPEAKER_01]: access to tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No shared root zones between varieties
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like even fucking cloning trays and
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know, dude, like once you
run into a scare, it's just like never
[SPEAKER_03]: ending.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like every last thing for over courses a
week.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I work with it, you know,
so I kind of see how it spreads to you,
[SPEAKER_03]: so.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like once you kind of see it,
you just you would rather want to stay
[SPEAKER_03]: like on top, like be precautious,
you know, rather than like, oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: shit, you know, my plants are sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I should put them on their own
saucers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's a really, really good point
for not using aero cloners to like if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing collecting, don't use aero
cloners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man, that's that for the disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can fuck your entire collection like
that, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I still had mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to have a couple one twenty eight
cell ones and I have some I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come pick up, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Needs to make that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we still got to go to the underground
garden down by you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent you that shit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit looks crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a lot to do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I guess another thing to add,
but they probably covered this on the TV
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast is Lee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like plants can stay very healthy looking
that are less susceptible to the virus,
[SPEAKER_01]: but still carry it and transfer it to
other ones that don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't assume any of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm laughing at comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone remembers back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day in 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we were talking about that back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been around for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just took a long time for us to
understand what that truly means.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll also add like I've worked on
clone trading discords and like I can
[SPEAKER_03]: guarantee you those fucking gardens are as
clean as some people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew like I see some pictures and I'm
like, I'd be damned.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm not a big advocate advocate
for clone cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that don't understand what they
have in their room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's abundant as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get messages from people all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I heard this clones for sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a good price for it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just smacked my head like,
don't even get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't get over how many of these
people use the phrase breeder's cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I know you're full of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got every breeder selected cut of
every single one of these varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cup winning breeder's cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I met so and so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, how can you prove that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you prove that you got a direct
from this person?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, well, I know him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, well, like.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a few questions from Duby.
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume that's how you say it,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the point of his name, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Duby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, taking care of and feeding long
flowering plants, let's say 12 weeks and
[SPEAKER_02]: longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Local, you want to go?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you've had a few.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's the same process.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're kind of just elongating the
feed, you know, like say because most
[SPEAKER_03]: schedules are designed for like nine week
crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like you're not going to feed a 14
week plant in a nine week period.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, I kind of just keep them
fed because they go longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll get hungrier, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, any specifics?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, don't go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to help do that translation?
[SPEAKER_02]: So for a nine week feed, what are the,
you know, they're like a few segments,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: How would that translate to like a 14?
[SPEAKER_01]: Beginning flowering, mid flower and
flower.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just elongate each set.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a 12 week plant versus a nine week
plant, each set gets like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and like a lot of the feed,
like if you follow like a bottle recipe or
[SPEAKER_00]: the recipe, it's like, you know,
like if you're running Kana, they say
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, if you have longer flowering
plants, like repeat weeks, like three to
[SPEAKER_00]: four, it has as many times as you need to
like then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you get to like,
you know, I don't know, like seven or
[SPEAKER_00]: eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would call it final swelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like growers, we should all know what
final swelling is, the final swell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also with longer flowering plants,
like they don't necessarily like nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: is heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to feed as heavy with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to water as much
necessarily with narrow leaf dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's little tricks like that that
you'll learn over time, but generally
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking, it's just a longer stretched out
of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to say though, that reminded me
as like a little distracted at first,
[SPEAKER_00]: that dude name was Doobie.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first guy that I saw growing indoor,
his name was Doobie.
[SPEAKER_00]: He passed away recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So RIP Doobie.
[SPEAKER_02]: RIP Doobie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doobie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to clarify, not the same person who
asked the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously not.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was my homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my homie's dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: He passed away too young.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, rest in peace.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well done, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that a salmon pig?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow up from Doobie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Experiences changing, growing styles
during your growing career.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything from minor tweaks to major,
major like style change, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done everything and it all works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done everything and it all works
except for me, I didn't ever get,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the fuck is it called, deep water
culture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like RDWC recirculation?
[SPEAKER_01]: I could never do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never nailed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's because I didn't have
a perfect chiller or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never had a chiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably why it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried it a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you need a major chiller to make
it work, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend was working on a farm in
Oklahoma that had like a whole greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: To maintain that, it just looked like a
nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'd rather have just like 20
gallon pots of soil or like a million one
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon plants on tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had my say in my space perfect and
wasn't renting at the time, my druthers,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would run tables nonstop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tables, cocoa tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because like, and have it just be
flood and drain, flood and drain,
[SPEAKER_01]: flood and drain, nice and easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do that with these blue dream
S1s after I get the initial switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I know for a fact the clone does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, three inch pots of that shit,
just like single spears.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, that waking life in like a one
gallon pot, absolutely like fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: slayed, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only imagine in like rock wool or
some shit, smaller pots, single cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be memed out of existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you see the one he posted after the
last episode I did?
[SPEAKER_00]: He posted it for like a second and deleted
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was me over like some shirtless model
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did he get you in some Tom of Finland pics
with like a mustache and like all naked?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Too good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew it was coming too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to reframe that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have any of you had to change styles out
of necessity?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like out of some kind of like situational?
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of, speaking of renting,
like I started off using doing tables and
[SPEAKER_01]: I quickly found like when I got a 24 hour
notice tables fucking suck for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like because all of a sudden you're having
to take plants out of a system of feed
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can't be dry like that all the
time because they're constantly having a
[SPEAKER_01]: flooding system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved them all to single pots and that's
when I realized I have to do a hand feed
[SPEAKER_01]: drain to waste after that point because it
just wasn't going to work any other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like renting kind of necessitated that
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having people come into your grow and
having to hide your grow necessitated that
[SPEAKER_01]: change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that's one thing to think
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're renting, don't necessarily jump
into tables because it's a really risky
[SPEAKER_01]: situation at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're harder to take down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them small if you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some two by fours.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fit in a Subaru and in a black trash
bag, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pots you can fit about 90 of the three
gallon into a small U-Haul if you really
[SPEAKER_01]: stack it hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean that was my main thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just bought my first house and so my
style changed a lot once I actually like
[SPEAKER_00]: owned a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like my setups different now because
I like framed out a little flower room and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to frame a little bedroom too
and cloning space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now I can be a lot more permanent,
but like the mobile setup, which I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like a lot of people are stuck with for
me, it's like, yeah, two by fours,
[SPEAKER_00]: small tents, grow Dan because you bring
him bags of soil into your apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the fuck do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I used to do it in a big apartment
complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just always every night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as white as you fucking can.
[SPEAKER_00]: People see that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: My landlord was literally so he was floor
level with street level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to park right in front of his
window and bring it downstairs right under
[SPEAKER_01]: him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I lived under my landlord and grew
above him to the left of him, behind him,
[SPEAKER_01]: across from him and below him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went to all these different names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was not fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then disposing of all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I mean, is getting rid of it
like the grow Dan makes it easy because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just taking the trash out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's kind of what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bottles, all the plastic bottles,
all the fucking shit, hiding all that
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have so many like Kana drugs that I not
like, you know, like used once.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like, I'm not just going to throw
shit away in residential, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: homeless people are going to fucking go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they'll dig it out and then leave it
outside the can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when you go use someone you
don't like scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, we all know you're just staying up
late gaming and you're pissing in those
[SPEAKER_00]: can't adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole tub is just filled with piss
drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen formula.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've changed, especially with clone when
it came to cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried every single cloning technique
from arrow cloner to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: domes to god bubble cloners, all kinds of
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always end up going back to domes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always end up going back to domes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like soil, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I tried doing the cocoa thing for the
small scale indoor and I didn't get bad
[SPEAKER_00]: results, but I was just kind of always mad
at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt like it was harder to dial in
certain plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like I just went back to pro mix
and like small amendments to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: like dry amendments and like fucking
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I blended all that cocoa into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like a king's mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess it's a hybrid of all now,
but good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was an interesting I've never really
thought or heard of something like this
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see it maybe stressing it out and
showing a herm trait that may have already
[SPEAKER_00]: been there, you know, because G4 is super
hermy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if it's a seed plant, doesn't it
still have still have some kind of hermy,
[SPEAKER_01]: too?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the worst way possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this could be a stress thing as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's super stressful to graft a
plant like most of them die until you get
[SPEAKER_00]: really dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I was watching people do it and
like got to do a few trays, all of mine
[SPEAKER_00]: died on my first few attempts,
you know, and then like one dude just had
[SPEAKER_00]: the touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like he was grafting all kinds of
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I had a friend who could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't very good at grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what we noticed was the root stock
is very important and you'll find a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a very compatible root stock
compared to everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not always what you think it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to me, I was blown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that piece of shit plant is
like the best root stock we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, OK, I mean, I guess it actually has
a use in my mind now, because like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the fuck we even flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: What in what context were you grafting to
begin with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, were you trying to do like the apple
thing, like the apple tree thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we were trying to like see if we could
improve vigor on hard to grow plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty root systems and like just low
vigor in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like Z stuff, OG stuff and put
it on a more vigorous root stock to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: it helped it grow better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would it what we realized is that
it kind of relieved viral symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a cut that was just dotted out,
it's the only copy you have access to and
[SPEAKER_00]: you still wanted to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get it like out of the full zone
where it'll flower normally, make some
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can trash the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did that with like the the Hindu
skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where those came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, because, you know,
they it's a thing with like obviously like
[SPEAKER_02]: agricultural crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Breed for root stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'd be cool for plant counts,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, someone should start a company
doing that and be like, hey, you got three
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just grow one massive outdoor and you'll
stay under your plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get three varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen those kind of like Hydra,
you know, those like on the forum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some guy does some really cooked like
Hydra project with like five different
[SPEAKER_02]: strains on one one plant kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who gives a fuck about plant counts
anyway, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, all the way, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, just be nice to your neighbors and
they won't rat you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm glad I'm moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this dick next door is like fucking
definitely ratted me out to my landlord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why I had to like rip my shit apart
midsummer last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like, fuck you, dude, because I have
six outdoor plants like I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was even six is five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have, I have a neighbor like that
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's like, he worked for the county is
like a, I don't know, like a tax person or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's always looking over my fence
constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy got two different, two different
graphs to work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grafted onto Steve Murphy's purest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen any pre-flowers yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we had really high failure rates,
depending on what the root stock was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not going to be the same for
everyone, you know, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like count these nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look out for these nuts, genetics and
these remodels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb should fix his web shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannot add seeds to the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell, I'll let him know it's so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try a different browser too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the same web person at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be totally redone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need both of our sites need to be
totally redone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am capable of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have so much other shit to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell, I'll let him know if they're
not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely try a different browser.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can be a big issue with a kind of
archaic old websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be very browser specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, it's a good question for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a good question for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys all go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the first train that smoke that
got you hooked?
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry excluded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Local.
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry excluded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue cheese.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say probably some of the first good
weed was from bitters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that I've had and grown was from
bitters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet V for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first was a purple train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple urkel train wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some like purple pineapple train
wreck and humble at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was at HPRC and it was all seeded and
it was really good, but that was actually
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the first seed runs that I like
grew plants out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a killer killer purple train
wreck cut in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be supposed to be purple
urkel train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I usually don't like purple urkel
anything, but I really like train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of leveled it out to where it
was no anxiety, but just really stony.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the first time I wasn't
getting like weird anxiety from purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really liked that one quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It showed me that I can like that kind of
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old dude next door probably smokes
dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smell that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call this soft power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soft power.
Soft power?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My neighbor's a single lonely dude who
likes to fuck with my lawn and take my
[SPEAKER_00]: garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll jerk him off, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he's not hot enough, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not your type.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not your type, then you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, this dude like fucks with my
garbage cans and like loads up all my
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, if I like, I don't know,
he just pisses me off so much and he'll
[SPEAKER_00]: like run my sprinkler and I'm like,
I don't give a fuck about lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm like, dude, like, I don't care
about the lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like less, it's like 100 square feet
in front of my house.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, he runs your sprinklers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, he leaves notes like on my car,
like, oh, you need to run this 30 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: a day, four days a week during the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a landscape architect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to leave a note on his car
that just said, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a homeowners association there or
something?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, dude, we're in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an old ass neighborhood with just
this douchey old dude who has the nicest
[SPEAKER_00]: house on the block.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, I hate those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's just a fucking dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worrying about the fucking lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might be watching that show right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to turn that shit into a tomato
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's so fucking lame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck you, Gary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck you, Gary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking Karen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking dude, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad I'm moving this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at the end of the questions,
but I wanted to ask Dan about something
[SPEAKER_02]: because we probably will do a whole
episode on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like a couple of weeks ago,
you were really wanting to rant about
[SPEAKER_02]: polyploids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to give us like a little like
some context for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's all the rage right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like HSC just released like a fucking hour
long video on it like two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't even get through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved HSC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, why I'm wearing this
flannel is because I have one of their old
[SPEAKER_00]: shirts on that I paint in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I'm covering this shit up,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polyploids are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a shenanigan, another shenanigan
to chase for people that aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the whole thing that people are
chasing is seedless, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I've read all these papers and
like you don't get seedless.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't get fully formed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it's less, but you get little
white seeds, you get pods, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, those are the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt a lot of them's ability to truly
make them and test for them because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know, like they at least hired a
real geneticist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: They had him talk in that video and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I haven't looked into the guy at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: He may be bullshit, but like, I don't
fucking know him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just read a paper on polyploids the
other day that just kind of fucking blew
[SPEAKER_01]: most of it out of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the only the only attribute that I
can say for sure that might be beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: is for mass scale outdoor seedless.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not worried about hemp farms and
herms and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I guess like it doesn't even protect
you if the crop itself firms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Three sets of chromosomes on a triploid
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they, they can line up with another
triploid item.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would imagine they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and like, um, there's also
people doing tetraploid work and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, tetraploid, you'll just make mix of
ploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another polyploid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tetraploid I believe can breed with
diploid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you're still going to have an even
amount of chromosomes, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: triploid can't make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean that there's no seed
that forms at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's dubious that claim in
a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really fucked with it in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like the other things more in the hemp
market that I've seen, um, and I won't
[SPEAKER_00]: name names there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know who they are, but they're,
um, um, have all these things about
[SPEAKER_00]: increased vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least in CBD plants, there was a
significantly different increase in CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: production, but that wasn't true for the
THC plants they tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get a slightly bigger plant,
but even when, uh, they were looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the yields, the flower yields weren't
increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biomass yields were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything's all about biomass for
these corporate assholes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, if you're not increasing THC
and you're not increasing bud yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: then like, I don't really see what the
point is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause all you're doing is enabling people
to grow more booth and crash the market
[SPEAKER_00]: out at a bigger scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like biomass, at least like the way
I understood it, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like when we were doing like lab studies
and shit, it's like the entire weight of
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, that's, yeah, anything you
pull out of the ground that gets put into
[SPEAKER_00]: that fucking bail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, to me, it just seems
fruitless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm wrong, but like, um,
nobody's actually doing interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding in the larger market anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, why would adding a new technique
to a bottleneck genetic pool, like really
[SPEAKER_00]: change anything?
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a marketing buzzword.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to be, I don't think
anything's really going to come of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like, we haven't really seen anything
come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've read the, we've read the paper,
Benjamin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what, that's the paper I was
referencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biomass increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biomass is not important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turn it into tinctures and you know what
I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like hash, like it's for me to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so biomass isn't really that useful to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a good, here you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did Eagle 20 give a certain flavor?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm fucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I'll tell you what, before I was
educated, I sprayed a lot of spectrocyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the guy that taught me how to do
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sprayed every single clone tray with
that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned on phyton 27, the phyton 27 and
spectrocyte mixed together turns black.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would call that black death and then
spray that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was bad and I would do it
without a mask.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm probably like of cancer as we
speak from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People laugh at me at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm like super serious about wearing
a respirator when there's just dust in the
[SPEAKER_00]: air, even, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I'm not breathing that shit in
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how much fucking immunox I
breathe then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even how much sulfur I breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't, I don't, I just don't use
like N95s and dirt, you know, dust masks
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You pull it off at the end of the day of
working and the whole inside of the mask
[SPEAKER_00]: is covered in dirt too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wear a respirator now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Painter's respirator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the, with the cans on the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I used it and I didn't start using it
until way later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun fact is the, the pink cartridge,
it's like a pink magenta.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like hot pink.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like a hot pink and then there's
like a magenta.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like three tiers of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you want to get like that really dark
pink for pesticide application.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they rated for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got hot pink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's just like the dust and
fumes one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably the cheapest one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it'll say on it, they, I think they do
call it a tier on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where are we at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't really have any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else that we wanted to talk
about?
He's nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, by the way, when I was having that
brain fire earlier, when you're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about the drops, I meant that there might
be another blue drop coming out,
[SPEAKER_02]: another blueberry, you know, another
bonnet drop, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about high and lonesome
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was probably confusing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The timeline on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is more blue, blue bonnet,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue bonnet stuff being made specifically
blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it blue light?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, blue light, blue and cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or blue and cross stuff being made.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's Kristen says what to look forward
to in this season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we, there are things there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be one very big and exciting
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know if, I don't think we can
talk about that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be doing more with the Kana
Kavana guys too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few more of the dudes we want to
have on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subrob?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Subrob too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stoked for Subrob.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Subrob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subrob, like for the, you that aren't
familiar with him, we have his seeds on
[SPEAKER_01]: our site under Seedtrip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subrob was one of the dudes that helped
run San Diego's Finest on Ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's probably one of the most respected
members, him, Sean Cron.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the ones that I'm closest with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just such an influential part of
the clone only trading scene during the
[SPEAKER_01]: forum eras of like 2007 to 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost everything ran through San Diego's
Finest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was one of the, I think,
longest running most pages so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they, I think they completely went over
page 500 and had to go to a whole new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's so many.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean he was the boss of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was fucking cool and he's just very,
very down to earth transparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've always gotten along politically and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm stoked to have him on.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's also very knowledgeable and very,
very humble with his knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stoked on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Kana Kavana guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's a lot more we have lined
up that we need to go back and touch on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be some good stuff this
season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I mean, just to give some
insight into our process, we're really
[SPEAKER_02]: more than a couple of weeks ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're not that professional yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like we have the whole season
mapped out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually me fucking it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see where it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, that's all for me really in
terms of like talking points today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we have the blueberry and cross
drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go get your bukkake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be putting it on the site
probably this weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I'm ahead of schedule on
getting the being shocked and all that,
[SPEAKER_01]: except I'm waiting for a printer to print
the labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, they're going out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully Amazon will speed their ass up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that the blueberry in cross is up for
order right now under preorder is probably
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go up in price after they get
made and packaged and sent the first
[SPEAKER_01]: round.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want everybody who's who gets in on the
early drop to to have some advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're part of our Patreon discord,
you get 30 percent off that price,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that only costs five dollars a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: So five dollars a month, you could get
thirty dollars off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember how much it is,
but it's a lot off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have the goat farm drop that I
need to get up to and package.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can also get 30 percent off on
those if you're part of our Patreon
[SPEAKER_01]: discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always, you know, shoot the shit on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make friends, make loved ones,
permanent loved ones in your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I it's like a nice family there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sometimes we have to whack a
mole, but it's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I learned some mango haystripes
coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your eyes peeled for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stoked, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those photos look absolutely
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I had to save a few or I was just
like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to look at that for the bank
bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's just really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just unique, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like different and the resin on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like, incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to smoke some.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess other than that, I guess this is I
mean, I don't know if this is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of season 10 or the start of
season 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we already did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I already like committed to this
being the first episode of season 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Season 11, episode one, motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and we have the raffles sometimes in
our.
[SPEAKER_03]: The raffles are super dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they were pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing I don't want to do is like
make gambling addicts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always concerned with that,
because like, you know, like in a group
[SPEAKER_01]: based on weed, there comes a background of
a lot of addictions and addictive
[SPEAKER_01]: personalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like that would be horrible to trigger
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to be very cautious about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, it's a good way to
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to keep a tally of who's playing
every week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you sit like three weeks in a
row, you're out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're out for like two weeks time out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I just want to be I want to be
careful and also say that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's always in our thoughts,
too, because they were just super fun with
[SPEAKER_00]: the live chat on there, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, co-parent with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I was just listening to those and
like doing drywall work in my house and
[SPEAKER_00]: shit and like having a blast, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made that shit go a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll probably do one this weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys know, I don't know which one
yet, but we'll do like maybe maybe a brief
[SPEAKER_01]: later's pack of the bonnet or something
like that or a blue and cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got resin on your balls accidentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eyeballs and lower balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes it can irritate the skin
because of sensitive skin on your scrotum
[SPEAKER_01]: sack.
[SPEAKER_00]: But impromptu waxing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eyeballs, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucked, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because I've been having to happen
nonstop all week while shucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in some weird trim scenes in
Humboldt, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's not an exaggeration either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some weird shit used to happen on the
hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I would love to hear about that
another time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, especially some of the other stories
that I heard from, like, especially female
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmers, like, holy shit, dude,
just wild shit happening out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I get in on this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, bro, you got to spill the
beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that going to be it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys any last words?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any shout outs this week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Papa D Denali.
[SPEAKER_00]: Papa D is doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love that man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love that man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't forget the space dude drops
coming soon from TGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't want to forget that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one is going to be a big one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a lot of seats to blow and a lot of
seats to shut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shutting and blowing that game.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Local, you got anything?
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to my cats.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to your cats.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were here the entire live.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, were they?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, Dustin, you got anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been coming up to the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, my brain is gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a fun show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess with that, we'll end it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to edit this into a real
episode because I think it sticks it into
[SPEAKER_01]: a live portion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes it harder to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done by this weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, from us here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: From IG and it's an amazing resource for
old catalogs and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope you join our union of breeders and
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come check it out.
We'll see you next time.
