[SPEAKER_00]: Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just for further context, so you
actually, and so Lou Elizondo came out and
[SPEAKER_01]: was disappointed in the, I believe it's
the A-O-I-M-S-G.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw Tim, you had similar concerns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to tee us up for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think, I guess concerns as
much as this, we talk about not having
[SPEAKER_02]: expectations, but this is what I kind of
expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, people are wondering what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why have you got, now you've got
this really broad, robust amendment,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then you've got the government,
you know, the DOD coming out of the blue
[SPEAKER_02]: with this other, you know, really watered
down kind of expectation, what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to achieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are like, what the hell's going
on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the cover up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the, you know, whatever?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's, it's, it's the government.
[SPEAKER_02]: The government is happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've heard me probably say this,
both on Twitter, I may have said it last
[SPEAKER_02]: time I was on your show, is people are
getting a crash course in how the
[SPEAKER_02]: government actually works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hate saying that, but, and I think
to some degree, you know, the UFO
[SPEAKER_02]: community, some of the, some of the more
well-known researchers or authors at times
[SPEAKER_02]: have done a bit of a disservice because
they've given this picture that the
[SPEAKER_02]: government is capable of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of this coordinated effort in anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not really the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably one of the best examples to give
you an idea of what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I talked to this a little bit about
with the guys and girl Chrissy last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, did anybody read the psychology
today article that was published?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it yesterday or the day before?
[SPEAKER_02]: Micah did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where was, where was it published?
[SPEAKER_02]: Psychology today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: UFO Twitter, you're dropping the ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a exceptional article done in
psychology today about UAP and what it
[SPEAKER_02]: could mean in terms of new science and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: The author of that article was Dr. Eric
Hasseltine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Hasseltine is a brilliant man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He once headed up Disney's Imagineering
and then he was the chief science and
[SPEAKER_02]: technology officer for the office of
director of national intelligence,
[SPEAKER_02]: ODNI.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was essentially the chief technology
officer for the entire intelligence
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very brilliant guy for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he wrote a great article there,
but he also wrote a great book a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago and I loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, let me be wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of right up in my alley.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may get too technical for some people,
but it's called the spy in Moscow station.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it tells this fantastic story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to understand how the
government works, it's a great insight
[SPEAKER_02]: into how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the short of the long there,
this is a very true real story of events
[SPEAKER_02]: that happened in 1978.
[SPEAKER_02]: The NSA discovered a Soviet bug inside the
embassy in Moscow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say discovered it, they found it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They removed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They physically had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an RF receiver hidden in a chimney
inside the embassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said that the Soviets are listening
to all of your communications.
[SPEAKER_02]: They told the CIA this and the state
department.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, the CIA had had Russian
agents killed during this time because of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the CIA and the state department said,
we don't believe you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had it in front of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they could have shown it to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't believe you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the NSA pushed it and there was this
big turf war.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not going to get in the weeds of
this book, but you really get an idea of
[SPEAKER_02]: how it works where you're like,
why are they fighting this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, isn't everybody supposed to be
on the same team?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like why is there this resistance here
into this idea that the Russians are
[SPEAKER_02]: spying on us?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the CIA was adamant about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the state department was adamant about
it to the point where they got a executive
[SPEAKER_02]: directive telling the NSA, stop mentioning
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop talking about it because you know,
we don't want people, we don't believe
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this went on for five years until the
NSA was eventually by order of president.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reagan allowed to go in, remove a lot of
the property that was in the embassy,
[SPEAKER_02]: found the bugs discovered and said,
they've been listening to you this whole
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for five years from the point they
found it and for five years, all right,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was so much resistance to this and
so much craziness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even at a point when the NSA had
difficulty finding these bugs,
[SPEAKER_02]: they actually thought that maybe the CIA
removed them so that they wouldn't find
[SPEAKER_02]: them to cause friction.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, when the NSA technician went to
do the inventory of the CIA, tried to get
[SPEAKER_02]: him drunk and had Russian prostitutes
because they wanted to know what he was
[SPEAKER_02]: doing there because it was so
compartmentalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that point of code word option
where only the NSA knew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now picture that in perspective to UAP,
okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Picture that in perspective that now
adversaries spying on you is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all know that's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes on, we spy on other countries,
they spy on us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But imagine the resistance to the idea
that the Russians or the Soviet Union was
[SPEAKER_02]: spying inside the embassy when you had the
proof and evidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the US government is a sprawling
complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now what you're seeing is that the UAP
subject is not gonna go away per se and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're kind of acknowledging it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're gonna see a lot of infighting
here as in who controls the topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the things in that hole
that caused so much friction between the
[SPEAKER_02]: CIA and NSA is whose job is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: They all say, well, NSA, their job isn't
security, so screw them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, yeah, but this is going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're gonna see this now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're gonna see this now with this
idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, fine, if you're not gonna let
this go away and somebody's gonna look at
[SPEAKER_02]: it, well, then it's our job.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you're gonna have other agencies
that are like, no, this is my job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Others are gonna say it's my job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at the end of the day,
nobody wants to get embarrassed and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh yes, this is really something.
[SPEAKER_02]: When technically it should have been their
job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if nothing else, I think probably one
of the most fascinating things for me,
[SPEAKER_02]: and maybe it's not as frustrating because
it's fascinating to me to watch this
[SPEAKER_02]: process, is I can't think of a more
complex problem to watch a government have
[SPEAKER_02]: to solve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially one like the US government.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everything is so segmented and
compartmentalized where different agencies
[SPEAKER_02]: fall under different branches,
they have different jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you look at the UAP subject,
that is something that is government wide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is a mysterious problem that
frankly, the US government is not equipped
[SPEAKER_02]: to handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's interesting to watch,
how are they gonna handle that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the DOD, I think a lot of people
when they saw that, I'm not gonna attempt
[SPEAKER_02]: the acronym, I've forgotten from memory,
I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They cried foul, but they were only going
to look into military ranges and ranges on
[SPEAKER_02]: their military control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's because by federal law,
the Department of Defense only has limited
[SPEAKER_02]: power.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have the power to operate on US
soil, except under very, very strict
[SPEAKER_02]: circumstances.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't have authority.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then goes into, well, some of this
authority bleeds into the Coast Guard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of this bleeds into the FAA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of this bleeds into Homeland
Security.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of this bleeds into the FBI.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone I just named, all fall under
different executive branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Secretary of Defense can't tell the
FBI what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't tell the FAA what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Likewise, none of them can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to comprehensively look at that,
you've got to get all of these agencies
[SPEAKER_02]: that aren't equipped to look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't work together as is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in many instances, they work against
each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in competition with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they've got to work together to try to
solve that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now tackle on the fact that every taboo
that you can think of in anything any
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation that you've had about the
subject with anybody who's not from the
[SPEAKER_02]: UFO community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they've just seen the New York Times
article or something, or they've read it
[SPEAKER_02]: excellent and informative on the debrief.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're trying to explain it to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, oh, that's BS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now imagine the government.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just multiply that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to have people that are
like, this is BS.
[SPEAKER_02]: The infighting and squabbling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if, let's say, the Gillibrand
Amendment passed, what office is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: take that authority is something to really
look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said that when I said my concerns,
it was more of a people are about to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: crash course into this UFO problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then because of how robust,
how structured that amendment was,
[SPEAKER_02]: it wouldn't shock me to see not just the
DOD, but you're going to see all these
[SPEAKER_02]: other people be like, oh, hell,
we're starting one too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're not going to be outdone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody's going to try to muscle in
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to end up in this really
interesting dynamic where a year ago
[SPEAKER_02]: people were upset because the government
wasn't taking the topic seriously at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now fast forward, we're upset because
there's too many people saying they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to look into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's my question on that,
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the reason, at least lately,
the reason why people got upset is because
[SPEAKER_03]: there seemed to have been a message coming
primarily from Lou.
[SPEAKER_03]: This AMSG office is undercutting and
undermining the Gillibrand Amendment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you also compared it to, you said in a
tweet that it's administrative terrorism.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so people heard that and they're like,
what's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you dig deep into it,
when you just simply dig into it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you find out that, oh, wait a second,
the DOD has no jurisdiction over this
[SPEAKER_03]: bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if this bill becomes law, they really
can't do anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems by the statement by Kathleen
Hicks that this office that the DOD is
[SPEAKER_03]: creating, they're doing it without
anyone's permission.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing it just because they can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's sort of this idea of,
well, they're not going to be the only
[SPEAKER_03]: ones who look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to look at it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I guess my question is,
why is this administrative terrorism if
[SPEAKER_03]: this office really can't do anything to,
if this law passes, if the Gillibrand
[SPEAKER_03]: Amendment goes through, which maybe we
find out tonight, if it could have
[SPEAKER_03]: happened already as we were on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if that, can you explain a little bit
as to why that's sort of the feeling with
[SPEAKER_03]: this new office?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because six months ago, we would have been
all aboard for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would have been absolutely filled with
an office like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems like for me, more data is
more data.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care where I'm getting it from.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're going to get more data from
different sections of the government,
[SPEAKER_03]: great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we can paint a better picture with
that data, or we could get at least a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit more clarity for the American
people as to what exactly we're dealing
[SPEAKER_03]: with here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I mean, can you touch on that a
little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of those things where I said
it and didn't realize after, until I said
[SPEAKER_02]: it, people might not be familiar with the
term.
[SPEAKER_02]: The term administrative terrorism and
anybody that's worked in government,
[SPEAKER_02]: even at the local level is very familiar
with that term.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used it all the time because
administrative terrorism is just that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bureaucratic stuff that slows things
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting ready to run out the door
to go to the mall and somebody says,
[SPEAKER_02]: wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, we got to
inventory all of your clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, what the?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is administrative terrorism.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that term is, anybody who's worked
in government has heard that term.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, used it frequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please don't take anything away from
that is that being, I guess, analogous
[SPEAKER_02]: with terrorism.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but I mean, it does make it sound as
if though, you know, like, like this is a
[SPEAKER_03]: bad thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This office is not good for the topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at least that's the way it seemed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seemed like that was the, and that's
why UFO Twitter sort of rallied around,
[SPEAKER_03]: like letting their senators know,
Hey, this office isn't good enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we need more.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want the Gillibrand amendment to make
sure that that passes into the new NDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's, you know, you know what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I think part of the, there's a
part of a little bit of fear here that I
[SPEAKER_03]: want to be used to construct a narrative
or a message.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that was going to be like a follow-up
question in a second was, is there,
[SPEAKER_03]: is there anything with this amendment or
with these new offices that you might see
[SPEAKER_03]: as like, as maybe not good for this topic?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything that we're just not
reading correctly, or we're not
[SPEAKER_03]: deciphering properly?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything in the language of the
bill that maybe worries you that,
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, this is actually going to do worse
for the time being.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think the biggest concern,
and I think that's what Louis Elizondo,
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't read everything he said or
listened to it, but I think that when he
[SPEAKER_02]: was upset about it is because he's been in
that system and understands kind of what's
[SPEAKER_02]: going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing is that it is,
everyone is correct in saying that the
[SPEAKER_02]: release of that information very much was,
it had a lot to do with the Gillibrand
[SPEAKER_02]: amendment, you know, the timing of it and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everybody could recognize that
even though Kathleen Hicks had said,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to do this, you know,
I believe the timeline initially was six
[SPEAKER_02]: months and it's been five months and they
come out with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The government does nothing early.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you think it was, you think the ODNI,
this was a direct response to the
[SPEAKER_01]: introduction of the Gillibrand amendment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the phone calls, phones
started ringing when that went out and it
[SPEAKER_02]: hit the airways and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were saying, Hey, what are we doing
with our stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we doing with our stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to get caught with our
pants.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to the fact that you've got
the Office of the Inspector General
[SPEAKER_02]: digging into it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of CYA going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are trying to cover their
ass and they're trying to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, again, like I mentioned,
nobody wants to get caught with their
[SPEAKER_02]: pants down where they haven't been doing
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea that ODNI is going to take
over this massive office and have all this
[SPEAKER_02]: jurisdiction and then prove all these
things that the DOD hasn't been doing
[SPEAKER_02]: well, does not sit well with the DOD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're like, Whoa, if nothing else,
we need to know what's going on within our
[SPEAKER_02]: jurisdictional bounds so that we don't
look like a bunch of clowns here with no
[SPEAKER_02]: answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: If this other agency has answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now beyond that Tim, do you think there's
actual information that they're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a handle on and bury prior to the
Gillibrand amendment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's a possibility or are
we really just talking about, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're just trying to cover our asses here?
[SPEAKER_02]: It really depends on what the executive
offices think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I can say that if it was going out of
the Undersecretary of Defense for
[SPEAKER_02]: Intelligence office, which is Lou
Elizondo's former office, I think you've
[SPEAKER_02]: seen the pushback that he's offered.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he is a good indication of how he
feels they view the topic and how their
[SPEAKER_02]: reports, their analysis and going into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, going back to something Micah
said earlier, if you go with this
[SPEAKER_02]: expectation of what you're going to find,
you often find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the expectation of that office by
all accounts, from everyone that I've
[SPEAKER_02]: spoken to, is that they want to find BS,
that this is not something that they need
[SPEAKER_02]: to be exerting time, effort and money on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so therefore the idea that that's
going to be their outcome, it could be
[SPEAKER_02]: very highly likely because that's what
they don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Department of Defense at large
has really made it abundantly clear,
[SPEAKER_02]: not direct statements because they don't
like talking about it, that they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas some other agencies do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, ODNI has taken the lead,
the Navy has taken the lead.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the concerns there is in having
these fragmentations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see that the DOD has their UAP
office.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, ODNI is like, screw it, we're still
going for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Space Force says, hold my beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Army is my favorite because
the Army is like, and I come from a big
[SPEAKER_02]: Army family, so I can say it's like
everybody I know from the Army who's just
[SPEAKER_02]: like, hey man, if we're going to strip
club and you're driving, but I'm down,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like they're, don't matter to
me, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is there is that each one
of those compartments will control their
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the topic of UAP, you won't have
this centralized focal point office.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead you'll have, you know,
a pilot had a sighting and reported it to
[SPEAKER_02]: the Navy office or the ODNI office.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're, well, do we have any
satellite data?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've got to go to talk to a
geospatial or the NRO or the NSA to try to
[SPEAKER_02]: get the SIGINT or electronic intelligence
on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then those agencies don't necessarily
always hand over what they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite frankly, they often don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's this idea that who has,
is there going to be a central office that
[SPEAKER_02]: has the authority, power and muscle to
really use all of the resources the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States government has behind it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because whenever we do put all those
resources, whether it's terrorism or
[SPEAKER_02]: fighting wars, they tend to be pretty
successful and they have a lot at their
[SPEAKER_02]: disposal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is that these things are
not centralized and they're not under one
[SPEAKER_02]: umbrella authority outside of the
president.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need the president, you know,
if the president would step forward and
[SPEAKER_02]: say, no, dammit, just same example I gave
you at the NSA CIA with the Moscow thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took the president of the United States
to tell the NSA, no, go do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't care what they say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's part of the concern is
that if you've got a ODNI office,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got a DOD office and you've got
these other offices is that they will each
[SPEAKER_02]: be examining the topic from whatever is
within their purview.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when one doesn't share with the other,
then it's never, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: MUFON and all these other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have these competing,
it's going to turn into UFO Twitter in the
[SPEAKER_02]: government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that sounds terrible, Micah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 17 seconds left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have to roll over into
the top of the arc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I have plenty to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, Tim really has kind of given
us, you know, the full scope of the issues
[SPEAKER_00]: that government is facing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: To an extent, you know, I've got to kind
of sympathize with any element within the
[SPEAKER_00]: government, or if we even want to refer
broadly to the military, having to be
[SPEAKER_00]: tasked with trying to resolve an issue
that let's face it, they've been looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at for more than half a century and
haven't been able to resolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about how, as Tim mentioned,
some agencies seem to be more willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: chime in on this and more willing to weigh
in on the topic like the Navy has been,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether that is necessarily by choice or
it is by virtue of the fact that other
[SPEAKER_00]: agencies simply won't, the Air Force dealt
with this in the longest running
[SPEAKER_00]: systematic military study by the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: government, Project Blue Book,
between the 1950s, early 50s and 1969.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they remain stone silent at every
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: For decades thereafter, with a couple of
notable exceptions after the closure of
[SPEAKER_00]: Project Blue Book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, at the request of congressmen and
women back in the 1990s, because there was
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of public interest in the Roswell
crash at New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this in part due to books that were
being published on it, television shows
[SPEAKER_00]: like Unsolved Mysteries that were kind of
reinvigorating the debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people were like, what's really
going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the Air Force kind of had to get
back into the game there for a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produced a couple of official
documents and did their own
[SPEAKER_00]: investigations, which offered not one but
several, you know, different explanations
[SPEAKER_00]: for parts of the Roswell mystery,
which raised a lot of questions for
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: One being, OK, well, which version is the
definitive narrative?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they had said that everything from
crash test dummies to charred bodies in an
[SPEAKER_00]: airplane crash to Project Mogul and,
you know, high altitude balloons that were
[SPEAKER_00]: used during the Cold War.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a range of different things put
together over several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constituted what was remembered or
misremembered as the Roswell event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that that's important is
because people look at that and they go,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, first of all, which is the narrative
or how can we take this seriously given
[SPEAKER_00]: that we first heard, of course,
that it was a flying disc, then it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: weather balloon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they say it was a mogul balloon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that they had lied several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we know they're telling the
truth now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in my opinion, having reviewed
Roswell, you know, again, I, like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: UFO researchers, have become less and less
enchanted with that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: As time goes on, because if you really
look at it again, I refer back to the FBI
[SPEAKER_00]: single page document on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually from, I believe,
let's see, let's refer to the newspapers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep them right here so I can look at
all this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: July 8th, 1947.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that on the same date,
the FBI documents said it appears that a
[SPEAKER_00]: high altitude balloon was recovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were reporting that in the FBI's
document a day before it appears in the
[SPEAKER_00]: other newspapers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually stated we had a weather
balloon in our possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seemed the FBI already had been
tipped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the historical documents seem
to pretty clearly show there probably
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't as much to Roswell as it once had
been thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's an interesting point to
look at in terms of history and what it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes to get an agency like the Air Force
back into the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no wonder they don't want to have to
deal with this right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people say, where's the Air Force
been?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is the Navy doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Air Force never wanted to have to get
back into this game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here again, I do sympathize with
almost any element within government who
[SPEAKER_00]: is tasked with having to do what the Air
Force tried for almost two decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: to do and weren't able to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the thing about, you know,
bringing this around to the Gillibrand
[SPEAKER_00]: Amendment, you know, I'm not particularly
surprised by what has been outlined with
[SPEAKER_00]: the new AOIMSG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we'll just refrain from further
jokes about the name, but almost
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody, Tim Burchett in Congress
actually got up and made a statement about
[SPEAKER_00]: this recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even he said, I don't know where they
got that name from, but everybody's joking
[SPEAKER_00]: about this name, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: My theory would be that it may be
intentionally unpronounceable and
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously unforgettable with the hope that
people won't be able to pronounce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People won't remember it and they won't
focus on it and worry about what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing because they can't pronounce the
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the UFO thing that they've got
up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wasn't really surprised by what it
actually is, according to the DoD release
[SPEAKER_00]: from last Tuesday, what was outlined
because essentially all those points were
[SPEAKER_00]: in Kathleen Hicks' memorandum that
coincided with the release of the ODNI
[SPEAKER_00]: report back on June 25th.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, she's saying we are very
concerned with these incursions in our
[SPEAKER_00]: military airspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to try and, you know, be proactive
with looking at these and dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to collect information about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never said, you know, we're going to
look at everything that happens anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: in the skies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, to Tim's earlier point,
they're not able to, there are
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdictional issues with their ability
to even do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so something we have to take into
consideration with all of this is that
[SPEAKER_00]: according to what Hicks outlined in her
memorandum, if we look at the ODNI report
[SPEAKER_00]: delivered by the UAP task force,
they stayed in the report.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is to guide future policy and future
efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this issue, they seem to have done
essentially exactly what they said that
[SPEAKER_00]: they would, but the surprise had been that
as Tim pointed out also, Congress,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, again, Senator Gillibrand
specifically got into this a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, outlined a much more
comprehensive plan, one that would be both
[SPEAKER_00]: more costly and likely would have to
require on the assets and abilities of
[SPEAKER_00]: many different agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this would be a much more elaborate
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the DoD looking at this,
this is pure speculation on my part,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's very much in line with what my
colleague has said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, they're seeing this and they're
going, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's hit this off at the pass because we
don't want to have to mess with anything
[SPEAKER_00]: as elaborate as what they're proposing in
this amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they launched this investigative
agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting now to see how those
who have co-sponsored the proposed
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment to the Defense Authorization Act
for Fiscal Year 2022 are responding to
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Gillibrand has spoken about it,
but she's been a bit, let's say that she's
[SPEAKER_00]: been a bit vague.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marco Rubio issued a statement to Air
Force magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had said, look, you know, I support the
government in looking into these aerial
[SPEAKER_00]: incursions and these mystery objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the sense, at least from
what I'm getting among, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: members in Congress right now,
is that this may not be what we wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is what we get, you know,
we'll go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously, Lou Elizondo and many
others, and of course, UFO Twitter,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've expressed their concerns because,
no, this wouldn't be the comprehensive
[SPEAKER_00]: plan that's outlined in the Gillibrand
amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be very limited in scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any assurance that there
will be, again, annual reports delivered
[SPEAKER_00]: to Congress, semi-annual reporting
updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, will the public have any
information provided?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, strange and paradoxical, though it
may sound, there's a part of me that hopes
[SPEAKER_00]: that whatever comes of all this,
we won't be handed all the answers
[SPEAKER_00]: because, again, at the end of the day,
we talk about this all the time at the
[SPEAKER_00]: debrief.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got into this because it's a fun topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do want to know the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can handle the truth,
but I doubt the government has all the
[SPEAKER_00]: answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a part of me still enjoys the quest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: of looking into this and trying to
understand what it's all about and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully applying science toward it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's anybody's guess where it'll go
from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we may find out within a few hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I'm not surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I certainly hope that there are going
to be a few surprises on down the road,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe that civilians will still be privy
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you guys make it such an important
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is so critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Luis and I have been talking about
this for months now is how critical it is
[SPEAKER_01]: that we don't attach our identities to a
specific belief system or outcome when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to UAP.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one of the things that
causes so much harm, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: psychological or sociological harm when it
comes to this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you do, if the outcome is so
important to you, a specific outcome is so
[SPEAKER_01]: important to you when faced with an
alternate reality, then you're subject to
[SPEAKER_01]: anxiety, depression, all of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's so dangerous,
really, when it comes to, and especially,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Tim, you brought this up earlier,
and I think it was such a such an
[SPEAKER_01]: important point that when society is in
struggle, when the world is unknown,
[SPEAKER_01]: when outcomes are ambiguous, it's very
easy to put all your hopes and your faith
[SPEAKER_01]: and your energy and passion into one
basket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you guys represent this topic
with a lot of journalistic integrity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're represented in a way that really
focuses on, let's have at this,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's pick a way what is truth and what is
fiction in order to get to the truth,
[SPEAKER_01]: because no one's preconceived notion,
no one's self-fulfilling prophecy is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be spot on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so critical that we don't allow
ourselves to personally, as individuals,
[SPEAKER_01]: go into spirals of anxiety or depression
or violence even over topics like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, I've had these
discussions with people who've worked on
[SPEAKER_02]: the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in the contemporary program,
so the task force, that kind of stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: or people who have worked with them in
different capacities whose names aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the big questions I had,
and Micah brought this up, that the first
[SPEAKER_02]: time we ever met and chatted, we talked
about psychology, because that's really
[SPEAKER_02]: where kind of my bread and butter is in
cognitive psychology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I asked them, I said, you know,
how much effort has been put into this
[SPEAKER_02]: idea of how certain are we that we could
perceive correctly something that is
[SPEAKER_02]: inherently alien?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say alien, not just as not from this
planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, something totally anomalous,
totally abstract.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no guarantees there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that this idea that we could
have it right is actually probably pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong, because we can only draw on what
knowledge and information that we have
[SPEAKER_02]: available to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what we can read in a book,
what we've been told, we can all imagine a
[SPEAKER_02]: dragon because we've seen movies by it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had them described to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But something that is just totally outside
of a total anomalous discovery,
[SPEAKER_02]: what is the expectation that we could
perceive that correctly?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't, you know, there isn't any,
you know, if we don't have the language to
[SPEAKER_02]: describe something, you're not going to be
able to describe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's an interesting aspect of all
of this, because it is such a fleeting
[SPEAKER_02]: topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be one of the
cornerstone tenets of this topic is it's
[SPEAKER_02]: always just a little bit, you know,
maybe it's a fleeting glance of something
[SPEAKER_02]: or it's a very intense experience,
but it's not captured on video or audio
[SPEAKER_02]: and all these different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's never this full picture of what we
define as being true factual or just
[SPEAKER_02]: ground truth reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, what does that mean
about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than perhaps there is aspects of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very difficult for us because we
don't know, we can't perceive what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to your point, Mike, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there is this idea that if we
encounter anything truly anomalous,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not going to have the knowledge base
existing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all going to be done in Kruger here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're going to believe that it's
something, but there's nothing that says
[SPEAKER_02]: it's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, if you put all your eggs in one
basket, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can cause a lot of distress both on
yourself emotionally, psychologically and
[SPEAKER_02]: just in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so part of that fun of long as there's
an unknown, it can be anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it is fun to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so let's enjoy that aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because even if aliens flew in,
there's really we have nothing on our
[SPEAKER_02]: plate here that says we would see them,
understand them or even comprehend it
[SPEAKER_02]: because it would be alien abstract.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real quick, I wanted to go back to what
Senator Tim Birch said yesterday on the
[SPEAKER_03]: floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just touch on it, because he did kind of
mock the name of this new office.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we got to let you know after you
do that, Luis, we let these guys go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then right after that, he wrote a
letter to Ronald S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moultrie, the Undersecretary of Defense
for Intelligence and Security,
[SPEAKER_03]: basically thanking him for this new
office.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then but also saying, you know,
I'm requesting that the AOI MS G brief
[SPEAKER_03]: members of Congress on their findings in a
classified setting followed by a public
[SPEAKER_03]: hearing, which means we could worst case
scenario, maybe get some public hearings
[SPEAKER_03]: out of these offices.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think that would look like?
[SPEAKER_03]: And could we trust this office to provide
the American people with, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: would we get David Fravor and Alex
Dietrich in a public setting like that
[SPEAKER_03]: from this office, do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: I highly doubt it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when they're talking about public
hearings, we would see something
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent with what we see all the time
with the public hearings, especially the
[SPEAKER_02]: national security public hearings where
you have an agency, the head of whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: agency comes and briefs Congress publicly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're oftentimes not all that
informative.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if anybody anybody else is a
nerd like me to watch the 2021 national
[SPEAKER_02]: threats hearing where they have all the
heads, the CIA, the NSA, OD and I is all
[SPEAKER_02]: there and they all brief.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the big threats?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one of the ones that obviously
came up was COVID, you know, is
[SPEAKER_02]: questioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we know where COVID came from?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we, you know, it could have been
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could have been that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you very likely could see the exact
same thing with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could see the director of national
intelligence sitting there telling
[SPEAKER_02]: Congress, yes, we what you read in that
report in June being said verbally,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, yes, we have this that the only
nice thing, I guess, would be in these
[SPEAKER_02]: instances, you do have lawmakers that can
ask questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can ask follow up questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Marco Rubio can stand up and
demand, is it aliens?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and some of these politicians do
a really good job of of grandstanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think that's where the
idea that people I would say the public
[SPEAKER_02]: has definitely had an impact when you see
these lawmakers talking about it as much
[SPEAKER_02]: as they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's who's the co-sponsor
from South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why am I drawing a blank on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Lindsey Graham, Lindsey Graham.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, good gosh, he could get all sorts
of animated.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, no one has ever seen him in the
confirmation hearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you'll be up there screaming,
jumping up and down.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be an interesting day.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just politically speaking, I would be so
confused.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't know what to do myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, I like I like what he's
doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what he's saying,
but God, I really don't like him.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's if there's any positive,
you know, if it's not disclosure,
[SPEAKER_02]: perhaps the best positive outcome that can
come from all of this news is people are
[SPEAKER_02]: actually paying attention to how the
government operates and lawmakers operate
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they they may go, this is stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how are we?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we get anything achieved?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've never we haven't faced another
attack because nobody's wanted to,
[SPEAKER_02]: evidently, because how does anything get
achieved?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if nothing else, hopefully,
maybe people pay attention to that and go,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, some things need to be changed here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if congressional hearings occur,
let's just hope that it's not Congress
[SPEAKER_00]: asking Robert Mueller questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you repeat the question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll refer to the report, the language in
the report.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that was sort of like a
secondary goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the phone home was just, hey,
teaching people how to interact with their
[SPEAKER_03]: government is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how to find the representatives
and you can take the this formula and
[SPEAKER_03]: apply it to whatever activism you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it works the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's just fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's that's always been a big
thing in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how government supposed to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter if we want the
government to go look for unicorns.
[SPEAKER_02]: If enough people in a democracy want them
to look for unicorns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what they need to do then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's the way it's supposed to
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I definitely commend you guys for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we appreciate you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And congratulations again.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the one year anniversary of the
debrief.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are not following these guys,
make sure you go to the debrief dot org to
[SPEAKER_01]: check out the news magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you guys could tell us quickly
where we could find you, Tim.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to find you on social media,
if they want to find a debrief,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's the best way to do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: At LT, Tim McMillan on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find me there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go on my little Twitter spats where I'll
be on there and cause me to argue with
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I disappear for a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are the kind of like the Houdini of
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I just, you know, and it,
and Mike has got a half hearted grin there
[SPEAKER_02]: because he knows, you know, he's always
like, Oh God, what did Tim do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tim's in a Twitter mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'll get on there and just rile up
with Mike Turber or somebody like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of flew on a tic tac.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta, you gotta talk to that guy,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you have to, you have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just gave him permission.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've completely disrupted the debriefs
in our operations now, Louise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't be the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God, every time it is an
accident, it is not on purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim, thank you so much for joining us
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, guys, go check out the debrief and
we'll talk to you again soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, the Mike,
a Hanks, if folks want to find you on
[SPEAKER_01]: social media, if they want to find the
Mike, a Hanks program or the debrief,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do they do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you want to find the debrief is
the debrief.org debrief media on Twitter
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's usually debrief media on the
various social media platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely check it out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, we report on a whole lot
more than just UAP, but even a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people who come there for that news of,
you know, expressed to Tim and to me and
[SPEAKER_00]: to Chris and to many of the other staff
there that, you know, you guys beautifully
[SPEAKER_00]: tie a lot of this stuff together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whether it's defense
developments like, you know, the
[SPEAKER_00]: hypersonic glide vehicle that was
apparently tested by Russia and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: missile deployment capabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pentagon looking at that and saying,
wow, how did they get to that point?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like what days later they
established this new UAP investigative
[SPEAKER_00]: unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're saying that there may be a
lot of things that may be catalysts for
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're seeing happening with regard to
the UAP topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we do sometimes look at tangent
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to find a lot of that at
the debrief.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn about me,
just go to mikeahanks.com and you can find
[SPEAKER_00]: all the podcasts that I produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got four different podcasts that I'm
doing right now, but the Mike Hanks
[SPEAKER_00]: program is the flagship.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes out every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris is going to be on there with me this
week, along with Tim.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a bit of a debrief
roundtable year end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did we come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did we get here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And who the hell are all of you?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can follow me on Twitter at Mike
Hanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made it really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's just my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have four podcasts now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've had four podcasts for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find all those at MikeHanks.com by
the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, there's the main show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a weekly current events and news
podcast called Metal Theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, tonight I'm going to be taping an
episode, hence why I got around here in a
[SPEAKER_00]: moment, but an episode of the Seven Ages
Audio Journal, which is the archeology
[SPEAKER_00]: show I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of my passion for
anthropology, I also have a show called
[SPEAKER_00]: Sasquatch Tracks, where we talk with
actual scientists, field researchers,
[SPEAKER_00]: anthropologists, investigators,
biologists about the possibility that a
[SPEAKER_00]: relict hominoid like Sasquatch could
actually exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I stay pretty busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, there's been some discussion
about a possible debrief podcast in the
[SPEAKER_00]: year to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to get any less busy,
am I, Chris Blaine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you so much, Micah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a pleasure getting to spend
time with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, you look and smoke in high
spot in the Men in Black get up,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I didn't actually wear this just so
I could look nice with you guys wearing
[SPEAKER_00]: your ties.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I wear all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually your pajamas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming on, Micah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Micah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all have a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Chris Blaine, I'm going to leave you
to these gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys go easy on him, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be kind to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.
