[SPEAKER_00]: What up, fam?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's me, Chuck Dog, AKA Chuckie Pylons,
AKA Chuck God, Chuckie Chuck Master.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on, guys and gals?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope y'all are doing okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been away for a little while,
not by choice, but because YouTube isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really happy with me and Matt,
how we've been cussing and showing plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we can't be doing none of that moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am working on some stuff, some growing
videos, some tips, some more plant videos,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we can showcase and show off the guys
and gals gear from the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't by now, subscribe,
like, comment, join the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's $5 a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get into the Discord, you get a 30%
discount on all Riot and a few other of
[SPEAKER_00]: the guys and gals gear on Matt Riot's
website, RiotSeasons.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get to hang out with Chuck Dog and
all the cool breeders and all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to kick it with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt ain't gonna be here tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's had a little thing pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even gonna be sure if I'm gonna be
able to upload this, so please bear with
[SPEAKER_00]: me and have some patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna get... This is actually
tobacco, and I'm smoking tobacco inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna smoke tobacco, and I'm gonna
tell y'all some stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna give you a couple little tips,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People keep pouring into my inbox,
saying stuff like, Chuck, what do you mean
[SPEAKER_00]: by some of the stuff you're saying in
these episodes with Kana, with growing
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger plants in one gallon pots,
stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I wanted to go on a freaking grow
log, a video grow log with y'all and show
[SPEAKER_00]: you how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't really think there's one
right way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People get good results with all kinds of
ways, but there are people out there that
[SPEAKER_00]: want some help and they want some tips,
and Matt isn't really into the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff or given, you know, he's more into
the breeder and history aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna get y'all some videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be on this channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have to be through the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have to be through the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have to be on another channel,
but I'm gonna get y'all some freaking
[SPEAKER_00]: plant videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna teach you guys how to do the
shit that I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ain't the best in the world,
but it will get you from the seed to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, I can promise you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing I wanted to talk about today
is a couple, well, the main thing is I
[SPEAKER_00]: freaking hate trellis nets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate nets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate trying to train my plants under
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate trying to do a pollen chuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate popping new seeds and I'm trying to
watch out for hermy hermies and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for this shit and I can't
because I gotta freaking net and my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are tied up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna say chug dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant, the net, the plant,
the nets, all this shit, it's gonna give
[SPEAKER_00]: you more yield, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's what they're for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something I can't stand is when I'm
freaking working with different plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing some chucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see some herms at the end of the run
that I didn't see because they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: netted up and I hate trying to get it all
undone, freaking up my buds, freaking my
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds are falling off because they're
hitting the nets and shit when I'm pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: it all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I wanted to give y'all a little
quick tip, a little quick, quick thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of y'all might know what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of y'all might not know, but $5 on
Amazon, get y'all, get you a little bag of
[SPEAKER_00]: these and you're gonna say, what are them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these are plant training clips,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna show you how they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna tell you something a little bit
about them and you're gonna learn
[SPEAKER_00]: something maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, you know, whatever,
just enjoy the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sit back, relax, work on your garden,
that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get you some smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire one up for Chuck Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw something in the comments for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know that you love Chuck Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know that you love Matt in the
show, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if you hate me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit gets me fired up too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to make love later to my wife,
so I need something to piss me off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me know in the comment section and
let's get it popping.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back to the clip, y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all know me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going off on tangents at all fucking
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oop, we said a F word, but we should be
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way these work are pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a plant, multiple plants,
whatever you're working with, and you got
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple tops, maybe a couple branches
growing too fast, too far up past
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to, you ain't got that hard
training that took up training where you
[SPEAKER_00]: take them stems and really, you know,
high stretch, train them and bend them
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked that kind of too myself,
but I kept noticing when I got them big
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking fans rolling, you know,
sometimes, and when you got them crammed
[SPEAKER_00]: in there like I do, sometimes you can
pinch off at the circulation of the flow
[SPEAKER_00]: of the water to those tops and they can
die on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not always, but it does happen and always
happens to your best plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the ones you love are the ones
you really want to yield out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see, I'm popping a lot of seeds and
genetics that I don't really know anything
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got these little clips and I'm ready
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, what way they work,
I love them on these Blue Dream crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: from Pock that I'm rocking out because
these things grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ain't ever grown some Blue Dream,
y'all, they grow like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking in three and a half weeks,
I got almost three foot of growth on some
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're freaking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's from seed, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking from when it pops open and
things up harder and stiffer than your
[SPEAKER_00]: boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my thing is here, and this thing,
this is when your branch is sticking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sticking up with another one going
this way, but for the sake of the
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstration of visual, pretend we got
two vertical branches going up a little
[SPEAKER_00]: taller than the rest of them or the rest
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got all this really great growth
down here, but there ain't no freaking
[SPEAKER_00]: light to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you want to do, these clips are
awesome because you can reuse them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can wash them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ain't a big plastic fan, but I mean,
what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take that first, you take that
branch, you tuck it in there just like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want to make sure you ain't
covering up any nodes or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to get a spot where you got
some space to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next thing you do,
you take that branch, heck, God dang it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take the rest of that branch and you
just slide it right under like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, all this growth popping out here is
going to go out and then up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to have a real nice
canopy with a few seconds of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's cool about these is two or
three of these per plant will do you good
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can go back in there later
that night or the next day, take that one
[SPEAKER_00]: off and move it up or move to another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then keep working them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love them because like I said,
you can reuse them and they're on the fly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in seconds, like I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go check them out if you need something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little tip for some of you new guys
and gals that are getting into growing
[SPEAKER_00]: nets, pipe cleaners, stuff like that can
work too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the little green gardening
wire with the rubber casing on there
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can use that for supporting
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use that for hanging stuff,
hanging your plants up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use that for a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use it for, you know, all over the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, don't sleep on little stuff
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need a lot to do a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need a little ingenuity,
maybe a little bit of a brain and just me
[SPEAKER_00]: a little few bucks and get you rocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really wanted to talk about some
other stuff, but we're going to save it
[SPEAKER_00]: for the Breeder Syndicate episode on
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's two days from now if I get this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can get this video up in time
tonight, it'll be two days from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to rock out Sunday night at
9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eastern for the Breeder Syndicate TV
episodes for now on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to test that out for a little
while, see what works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like more people are tuning in on
the weekends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a lot of people come in on
Wednesday late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a few of you guys on the Discord
say that you really like it on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sorry, but it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to move it around just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see where it goes from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did pick up some kind of
recreational bud that we joke about a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll save it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll save it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to compare it to the
Blueberry Iax from Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of experience with that
growing that one out, smoking on a few
[SPEAKER_00]: jars of that for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to compare them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the results are going to be
pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tune into that also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a solo episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we'll get back to the guest and
doing interviews and stuff on the next
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to try something out a little
different and see where it goes from
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as far as Matt and stuff,
tune in every Friday at 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eastern as well for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because me and Matt, we go in and there's
some kind of new diseases and some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: new cold sores for the plants out there
that we were going to talk about tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about it next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to talk about some of
Matt's old work, some of his older
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few to stick out in my mind when
I read them through the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to know some more about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as far as my garden and stuff's
concerned, I'm rocking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 70 degrees outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm preparing for a little bit of outdoor
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of suck at outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't got a lot of experience in it,
but I'm learning quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm going to rock out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use H&L's soil mix this year
and I'm going to come strong with the
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to come strong with the
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get them covered up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do what I got to do this year
to rock it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we'll jump into a little story
real quick before I let you guys go.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the height of my my my hustling career,
you could call it the Kentucky Trap Lord.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was riding high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was living the dream, had two or three
girlfriends, making good ass money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a duplex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was rent now and I was having a good
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at this point, I hadn't had a
real job for a while, for a few years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I really was dependent on hustling to
get me where I needed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I rocked out with my main
plug, if you want to call it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why else to call it without
getting me in trouble on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll call it a plug, as the kids say
these freaking days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a plug for almost 10 years that had
really excellent quality that really put
[SPEAKER_00]: me above all my competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my local area, so if you want to know
more about it, go check out the Breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: Syndicate TV episode number two with
Scrooge trying to talk about it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mainly, my dude, he ended up being
late to work one day and took the bypass
[SPEAKER_00]: and was going a little bit too fast and
ended up getting pulled over by a state
[SPEAKER_00]: boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a while, so a little bit
more serious, but it wasn't extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: serious getting caught with buds in
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the time, he got pulled over and he
had enough on him to make the car stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cop was like, man, I know you got
something on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you tell me what it is, you know,
I'll be cool with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this, you know, all the shit they say
to get you to do what they want you to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, dude goes along with this,
you know, I got this, this, this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he still goes to jail though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know this at the time,
but I'm running out of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, hanging out with the dab hose,
getting dirty with the riff raff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hitting dude up saying,
because I'm seeing him every two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: days at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hitting him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you at, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to come get something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, two days go by after I ran out and I
got enough for me to smoke about,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, a zip or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm smoking on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow I don't remember if his mom,
I knew his mom's and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she would write me sometimes or she
would, you know, serve me or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: if he was out of town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was his mom's hit me up and
was like, Hey, he's in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, in jail for what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she told me what everything that
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she's like, yeah, he's in jail for a
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I going to do, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, they let him out on work release,
like a weekend and he gets a phone
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow, but they let him go to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he texts me and he tells me like
everything, like the rest of the story
[SPEAKER_00]: tells me it's going to be a month or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when he gets out, he wants to lay
low for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, fuck, what the hell am I
supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm out of weed and my people are
blowing me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like freaking dominoes on Friday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: When is he going to be in, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: When are you going to have it?
[SPEAKER_00]: When are you going to get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: When are you going to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: When are you going to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, y'all know how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to figure shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause at this point it's been so many
years of just messing with this one guy
[SPEAKER_00]: that I burned all my bridges or didn't
burn my bridges, but I just hadn't talked
[SPEAKER_00]: to any of those other guys that I mess
with before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, not mess with like what you guys
think, but you know, getting that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so I'm hitting up everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitting up cousins, hitting up step dads,
all of them in the whole County.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got wait cause I, I need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is back when droughts were actually a
thing for people that don't know what a
[SPEAKER_00]: drought is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It towards the end of the year,
you run out of bud and then there ain't
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing, there ain't nothing you can do
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so finally, one of my customers,
this chick, I wouldn't even really call
[SPEAKER_00]: her my customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: She goes, she, one of the other customers
was like, Hey, this chick I know needs
[SPEAKER_00]: some stuff her and her dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, you know, all right,
I got a little bit left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to make some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go and meet them out in the back
road.
[SPEAKER_00]: One lane dead end type shit on a fucking
corn farm, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not even their house or some old
lady's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know, but I meet them out
there to give them this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell my buddy, if you call him,
he's kind of a buddy of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd been messing with me for a while,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told him like, dude, I'm,
I'm almost out of bud bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do y'all know anybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cheeks like my uncle, my uncle,
he, he grows and he, he's got,
[SPEAKER_00]: he got bud right now and he's out in this
one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like basically like 40,
45 minutes away out in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: nowhere, like nowhere, nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, he could get you whatever
he wants, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking like, I didn't jump on it
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've thought about it for like a day or
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally I hit to, I hit them up after
I got their number through my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yo, that chick,
she said she could give me stuff for her
[SPEAKER_00]: uncle, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we, can we do something?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, so he hits them up and she's
like, yeah, I'll, I'll text them and I get
[SPEAKER_00]: her number and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within like three or four hours,
I'm picking up her and she, when I'm,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I go to pick her up, she's like,
you mind if my boyfriend rides with me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, dude, really sketch the fuck
out, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm thinking like, all right,
she hops in the driver's seat and I'm in
[SPEAKER_00]: an old Monte Carlo and he gets in the
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my thought is, is like, dude,
this mother, this dude could, let's just
[SPEAKER_00]: say he could mess me up from being back
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even hardly see him, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So before he even gets in the car,
I'm putting the rear view mirror so I
[SPEAKER_00]: could see back there, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chick, she was all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: She kind of hot, dude, like in a weird
way, you know, like a country weird way,
[SPEAKER_00]: like down in dirty cash stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I probably would.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my point is she's like on the way out
there, she's like talking about how her
[SPEAKER_00]: uncle's kind of, kind of cool,
but he's kind of crazy too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a chance he's going to meet
me, meet us at the end of the road on a,
[SPEAKER_00]: an ATV or something with a weapon on them
and all this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking like, dang, like I got
robbed a few years before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I'm not really prepared to
get robbed again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had brought, I don't know if y'all
know what I'm talking about, but those
[SPEAKER_00]: magnetic boxes you could put on stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the money in one and then I had
something else in the other one,
[SPEAKER_00]: if y'all know what I'm saying,
just in case shit went south.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, she's telling me all this
stuff about her uncle and he's redneck as
[SPEAKER_00]: hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I got a lot of family members out
where, that live out where he's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are kind of crazy out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of real redneck, you know,
like don't have neighbors type stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: just farmer people, real good people,
but some of them are crazy, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like anyways, so we're getting out there
almost the dude and the chick,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were cool, but I mean, not some
people really, like I said, you'd really
[SPEAKER_00]: want to hang out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure they were on some other
shit, to be honest with you, but chick was
[SPEAKER_00]: too skinny, bro, like really skinny,
but you know, he's strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so we get out there and of course
dudes waiting for us and this dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know how to like maybe like a
younger Colonel Sanders, like silver,
[SPEAKER_00]: black, goatee, kind of real darks,
like dark hair up here with speckled,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's silvering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he looked like, he got a big
mustache, like fucking Burt Reynolds,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's sitting on this ATV with the,
with one, a stick, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: On his lap, like trying to be all
intimidating and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sitting there thinking like,
dude, I could run this guy over right now
[SPEAKER_00]: if I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was thinking like, man, I do need
some pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if y'all have ever been in
the sketchy shit situation when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: out, but you got to get some pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of stuff was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I have bills and everything
running on this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pull up and I roll down the window
because I ain't getting out dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, you know, not much,
but how you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, my niece says you want some,
some green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, well, follow me back to the
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know, I'm here with
boyfriend, her on the way back is one mile
[SPEAKER_00]: gravel road in the woods with dude on the
four wheeler.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, and he takes off bro, like course
flying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he's showing off or trying
to get back to the crib, set me up,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm taking my time thinking like,
what if you saw, how's this all going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a mosquito in here, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm following dude and takes off on
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, where the hell is this
dude's crib at?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, it's up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude in the back, getting a little
squirrely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we pull up and dude's already inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she gets out of the car and
boyfriend gets out of the car and then
[SPEAKER_00]: just go right into the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like real quick, like, this is sketch,
but I'm sitting there and the Duke opens
[SPEAKER_00]: the door and he kind of weighs me in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And go in and smells like weed,
you know, as soon as you walk in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if y'all have had them
stoner friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got fucking trash, bombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, ashtrays stacked up with a
mountain of ashes, roaches, like every
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking thing, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is back before I really seen
anybody dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like probably the first time I could
remember seeing somebody doing
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates and it's his son.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other people in this house.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go in, I'm like, fuck, I don't like
this at all, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell, like not the way I like to operate,
you know, I like to be chill, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really want a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even really want anybody other
than you there really.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, desperate times calls for
desperate measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to do what I had to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went in and like I said, they're in
there dabbing and the son introduced his
[SPEAKER_00]: self to me and the other son introduces
his self to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like we get to talking, you know,
kind of seeing if everything is cool
[SPEAKER_00]: before a dude pulls out the buds and
getting a feel for each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, you know, you want to try
this this shit out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, it's a dab or a wax or
whatever he said at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, I'll be honest, looking back,
it was some of the worst shit I ever seen
[SPEAKER_00]: in life, like green as fuck, terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I'm like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys, I gotta be cool, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I smoke it with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, the dad, he hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like the other brother hit it and
the chick hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boyfriend hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like uncle gets high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's kind of getting cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's asking me shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we grow and we got the plants in the
other room and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, you could see it if you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, this is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, like I would not be showing some
random dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I barely met my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess they were just excited that it
was somebody else other than them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were wanting to show me and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just like kind of peeped in there
and they had like the metal highlights and
[SPEAKER_00]: shit going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing like five gallon buckets,
you know, like stupid tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the way they were doing it was
terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dude's like, you know,
you want to see the bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I got three or four flavors and
I make use to my dude at the time having a
[SPEAKER_00]: few flavors for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got excited because it was like,
OK, generally in Kentucky at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: if people had multiple different,
you know, bags or strains or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars, whatever you want to call them,
usually it meant they they were doing
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were, you know, that was just a
good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually if they have one, usually they
want it done or they just yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, who really wants to get stuck with
the same shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like part of my whole thing was having
something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every few days and just having something
new and fresh every few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dude had a few different ones and he
pulls them out in five gallon buckets with
[SPEAKER_00]: lids on them, which, you know,
I've seen people do it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he pulled them out and do this shit
smelled so goddamn gross, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking like straight up hay pulled
way too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still wet, still green, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's terrible, terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could tell you the prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's just say pretty shitty,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get ripped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ripped myself off, really, because I
could have said no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, like I said,
this is all I had left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, man, you know, I was like,
I could maybe make this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and I kind of like bartered him down
a little bit on the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just went with the smallest amount I
could get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of there, I felt like without
offending the dude and enough to get me
[SPEAKER_00]: through, you know, because at this point,
I like didn't even really have smoke for
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And given the money and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got to go out to the car first and
get it out of the magnetic box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, fuck, I forgot my wallet in the
car, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like everything's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't really worry about the other
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to get the wallet and I come back
in and I give him the money and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, you know, if you need more
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit me up, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we end up leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take the girl home and the boyfriend
home back to the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked him up at and I end up giving a
little bit just to like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: say thanks for helping me get scoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nastiest, but I have ever freaking
seen homegrown style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all my customers hated me for a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I ended up finding something
else, I think, like a week after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then dude eventually got out of jail
and started messing with me again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got to rocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was hard, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I fucking man, I was sketchy,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was funny about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But later, like two months later,
that that house, those people got robbed
[SPEAKER_00]: by one of the sons and his friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came in and took it all, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of shit that would happen all
the time in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if someone show you some shit or
somebody has some good shit, they were
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too long after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was done, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hope you all enjoy the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you all can relate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've been through a lot of sketchy
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've I've had a lot of fun doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss it sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't miss it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm living in somebody's garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really talk shit and broke as
hell, but it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're rocking out for Breeders
Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're rocking out with Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to riotseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick up some the laundry list,
a list of genetics that are on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll blow you away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with some freaking blue sour
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is raunchy as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No blueberry turps, but raunchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pumped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check out all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join the discord.

sometimes.
