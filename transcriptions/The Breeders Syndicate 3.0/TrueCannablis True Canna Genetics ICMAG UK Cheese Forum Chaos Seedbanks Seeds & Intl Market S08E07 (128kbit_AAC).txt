[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_04]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_04]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm your host Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie
[SPEAKER_04]: Noxodon, Breeder and grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_04]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start writing some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here with Barry from True Canna
Genetics and True Canna podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got an awesome history in our scene,
been around forever, been around the seed
[SPEAKER_04]: game forever, the forum game forever,
knows the ins and outs, and he's from the
[SPEAKER_04]: UK and is integrally involved with helping
spread cheese as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm interested to get this going with you
and trying to figure out where to start
[SPEAKER_04]: with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where does your interest in genetics even
begin?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: With me, being a European grower,
there were certain things that obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: stood out to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the Dutch seed banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a lot of our influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing with me is I became just
obsessed with cannabis in my youth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I was starting to hunt all of the
different magazines to look at different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It eventually led me to Hasheesh by Rob
Connell Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the pivotal moment that upon
reading that book, I got to the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: decided one, I was giving up tobacco
because as a European, we'd been taught
[SPEAKER_00]: that you needed tobacco in joints to help
you, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was foreign to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like only rusters smoke pure,
and it was called that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You occasionally met a Jamaican guy and
he'd smoke idols and wouldn't smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the only knowledge we really had
of that in England.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden discover that I didn't
need tobacco and to learn so much about
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant from the book, Hasheesh,
that was what sparked me wanting to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and get into it myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so wild how many people Rob Clark
influenced in our sphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, to have read that book and been
inspired to grow and then many years later
[SPEAKER_00]: to have hung out with Rob and Dave Watson
and smoke with them and pick their brains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to equate it for anyone
else, but it's like to hang out with the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that inspired you and your heroes
and then for them to live up beyond your
[SPEAKER_00]: expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of my greatest moments is
hanging out with people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rare for them to actually live up to
expectations too, as I've learned,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially in the seed world, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you take it from there,
you finish the book.
[SPEAKER_04]: When did you start buying your first seeds
and getting into the seed game?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you know what it was?
[SPEAKER_00]: After reading Hasheesh, I then got myself
Jorge Cervantes, Grow Bible, decided that
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed to read that front to back before
I properly got all the equipment because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd grown a plant outdoors, grown a few
with a friend, but made silly mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We dried outdoor plants by putting them in
plastic bags and putting them in the air
[SPEAKER_00]: in a warm place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew I decided I'm going to read the
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I read that book at the back of the
book, there was websites and we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: 99, 2000 now, just on the millennium point
and in the back was Seeds Direct and
[SPEAKER_00]: Overgrow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minute I looked into Overgrow.com,
Heaven Stairway, all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: websites blew my mind, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I became, it's making a hair stand up from
my arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must've spent like months and months
just like through the night, just spending
[SPEAKER_00]: hours upon hours, refreshing threads,
reading through the strain guide on
[SPEAKER_00]: Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dismissed half my school knowledge in my
brain in favor of the strain based off of
[SPEAKER_00]: Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just replaced like, I'm like,
chemistry, I can push that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geography, I don't need that for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: History, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strain guide, Grow Bible, sheesh,
these are the things that became a
[SPEAKER_00]: priority to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just became obsessed with another
genetics from there, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: To begin with, like a lot of growers,
I was afraid to spend money on seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you work a job, you're getting paid
200 pound a week for a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even back then, it was still like 80
pounds for a pack of serious seeds or T8
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds or you know, the big fours that were
kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: God forbid you want Sensei and you got to
pay 350 pounds or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just not fathomable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started with, like a lot of people
back then, Nirvana seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Casey Brains and Nirvana did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they were the one, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the cheapest ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started with a few different ones of
those and then it was kind of like just
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly like obsessing over,
like over growing things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that point still, I was terrified
about actually ordering seeds from a
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these times I was buying them from head
shops that were like, I could actually
[SPEAKER_00]: drive to and pick up the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gave me a very limited amount of
what I could actually grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing like those kind of Nirvana
things where I went through like the white
[SPEAKER_00]: widow that they did, the white rhino that
they did, skunk number 11, which was a
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a few shimarchal, like a few
different kind of ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you do AK-48 at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that I went for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was so popular back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the big grip off ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crystal, crystal or misty.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was in the, oh,
Doublelicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, Doublelicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their version of bubble gum was the one
that I wanted so bad that I had to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after a little while, I discovered like
the Seeds Direct was actually in Kingston,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was kind of just outside London.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I phoned them and said like,
can I come to your store?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a shop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure enough, they had an actual walking
stock shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a little road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you went there, Gypsy Nirvana and
his wife at the time, who later split from
[SPEAKER_00]: him and had an affair with Pluralamongus
mixed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this moment, they had three shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had the seed shop, the head shop and
the grow shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went down there and I bought some
bubble gum because I wanted to try
[SPEAKER_00]: something amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: American bubble gum things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob was online.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was so active.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: He interacted with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just came across like a good person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that he communicated with you
made me want to choose him as the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: brand I went with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got some of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was other things like the thing
that always appealed to me about Seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: Direct back in the day was all the
freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would buy one pack of seeds and you'd
get like five other different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then, I remember Gypsy was giving
away freebies that were like G13 hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: G13 cross orange something.
[SPEAKER_00]: G13 cross something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm not sure who made them where,
but I remember I've got some of those and
[SPEAKER_00]: a few different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of my first foray into
like some American genetics and some
[SPEAKER_00]: different things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember he carried that G13 stuff all
the way up until they got busted,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he kept doing the project.
[SPEAKER_04]: He kept all the way through Dutch Grown,
like when Dutch Grown popped up with
[SPEAKER_04]: selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember they did a G13 VX, I want to
say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know who made those original
ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to know what their source was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was something in Switzerland,
like what Swiss made.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those kind of places out that way,
I would presume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because so many of them, it came from
those kind of places where there was
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive amounts of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bulk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bulk buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the days when I remember you
started the skunk number one from Sam
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunkman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was also the Skunk Ty Hayes
freebies.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Durban.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Durban one as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a Durban cross.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Skunk Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those went out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That Skunk Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember Crazy Composer grew one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grew for almost like a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most disappointing things I've
ever smoked in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when you're like, oh,
you're thinking to yourself, man's gone to
[SPEAKER_00]: so much effort to cow this thing out
forever, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, it just didn't fucking bang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones are just so hit and miss those
kind of plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're so highly variant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So after Nirvana and your foray into the
forums, when did you start getting like
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of more tied in genetically and start
more experimenting on your own?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what the key thing was,
was to start going to the icy mad cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the key thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because up until that point, you didn't
know anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weren't meeting no one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I told nobody one of the first rules
in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, his event is one is tell nobody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell nobody.
Nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a tie like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think people nowadays can conceive
the level of secrecy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat and smoked with good, close friends
of mine for years without them knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: that what we were smoking, I had grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's so hard not to want it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to tell your best friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, dude, like you have to pretend you
went and picked it up and do the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: facade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, do you know what was so funny?
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and another icy mag member,
Dr. D, he like he used to live in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Midlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he would come down to London,
everyone would be like, oh, is that your
[SPEAKER_00]: weed guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who I get my weed from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I would go visit him,
he'd be like, yeah, that's who I get my
[SPEAKER_00]: weed from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least we kind of separated ourselves
from being the guy that someone else to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of distract people with because yeah,
it was such a worrying time then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we went to the icy mag cup,
even then I was still dubious of like
[SPEAKER_00]: talking with English people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am more communicated with the
American people that I'd spoken to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's those kinds of connections that
started to get me a lot more genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also met Brightside, the icy mag member.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person that had the cheese cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the first elite cut that I
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was because I kind of back in the
day, you had to earn your stripes to get
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to turn up with Bud, show some
passion, show some good bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you were a good person and you
were doing good work, people would offer
[SPEAKER_00]: you cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never really asked for cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of taboo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never had to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was improper.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was improper to ask for cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all knew that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You find your place in a group.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if people trust you, something
sometimes should happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't, you know, you're not in control
of that, but it shouldn't matter anyways.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like that's that's the attitude
of it for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that was that that was kind of
that point there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, like for me, I was just obsessed
with American genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I started to read things like I'd
always been obsessed with things like high
[SPEAKER_00]: times, you know, when it told you the
different bud in different states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was always curious of these different
strains, different names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the things that I wanted to
hunt for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when I started to kind of like
use the people that I'd met to kind of get
[SPEAKER_00]: different seeds to hunt out the different
genetics that had like cushion and some
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some like things that weren't train
wrecks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, yeah, there was certain
cuts, a deep wreck, I remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was a deep chunk across train wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, I was just trying to get all
the different things that were either in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canna Bible or that I'd seen people grow
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just then an obsession to just
phenohunt and try as many seeds as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible and grow out as many things as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you'd been to an IC mag cup and
met people now, the buying seeds wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really an issue because at this stage,
I'm a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't sell no bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never sold any bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just grew for myself, smoked it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spending big amounts of money on seeds
weren't possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once I went to an IC mag cup and met a
whole bunch of growers from America,
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, all around Europe, met a couple of
nice English people that I could then feel
[SPEAKER_00]: safe with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it just opened up the world of
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, yeah, we were able to
trade cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a Cinderella 99 cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the cheese cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a few different ones that were
being passed around, an L5 haze that was
[SPEAKER_00]: like a cut from in the south of England.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm really curious to try a lot
of these American cuts that are
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially an L5 haze cut because we had
our different areas around the country
[SPEAKER_00]: that had little famous cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, North London was famous for the
hazes, super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be nevels.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would always be solid hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of North London, in South London,
there would always be lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon scone, lemon haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon was always famous in that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every little part of London,
there'd be pockets with famous little
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that would make a little mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did cheese kind of permeate all of London?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exodus Luton, where the collective was
that spread the cheese, that was like 40
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes outside of London.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a free party thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the cheese cut would spread and
start to hit different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was down in Bristol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went up to Liverpool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in London.
[SPEAKER_00]: So slowly it was spread around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd all of a sudden start to hear
more and more people having it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But early 2000s, a lot of people didn't
have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It weren't something that was around.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most cuts back then, it was a myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to find someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Big Buddha bought the cheese seed
line out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that made the water murky for the
original cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got a little confused in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you talk a little bit here about the
actual history that you know as you know
[SPEAKER_04]: it for the cheese?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, basically there's a story in one of
the Weed World magazines that talks about
[SPEAKER_00]: the guy who actually passed it to the
person that we know to have the cut as the
[SPEAKER_00]: originator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was an online member called Of The
Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Of The Hill was on UK 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the grower who passed it to the
Exodus Collective, which was the free
[SPEAKER_00]: party, like little society that lived
there and kind of done all of the raves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened is it was started by
someone else, passed on to Of The Hill,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then he took it to the Exodus
Collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it was crossed, passed out,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was he one of the people who knew it was
skunk wine originally?
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was friends with the person who
actually popped the seeds and bought the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds back from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a thread on UK 420
where Of The Hill references crosses being
[SPEAKER_00]: made with his cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the crosses he mentions is
something called Back To Cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Back To Cheese was a cross that
Brightside did with a Casey Braines mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of why the Brightside cut
had such reverence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was verified by the guy who
passed it to the Exodus people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brightside knew this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in essence, it's what the like,
to coin the term, pre-Exodus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the pre-pre-Exodus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That just had to be said for the sheer
joke.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the pre-pre-Exodus.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always wondered about the story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because over here, you know, like I would
hear about cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a cheese cut over here that I
believe came down by a vision creator
[SPEAKER_04]: somehow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we all run that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's highly variant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it'll smell a little berry,
sometimes fruity, sometimes foot funk
[SPEAKER_04]: cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all over the place, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's hard to explain to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I remember when I got the cut a few
times from people, I'd be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, no, this is a fake one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Toss.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a fake one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Toss.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like after blooming it,
it looks the part, but it's not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real one grows kind of almost lateral.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets to week five, it all just
flops over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's woody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Woody as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stems are super woody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So after growing this, I started hearing
from the UK, nah, man, you need to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: the psychosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to grow all these other ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I heard about the bright side and
I'm like, well, which the fucker one is
[SPEAKER_04]: it?
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is the psychosis?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another one, too, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the psychosis is like another seed
that was from a different cross or it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure exactly what the psychosis
is, but there's also another one called
[SPEAKER_00]: the livers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a cut up in Sheffield,
which is a kind of blue, kind of cheesy,
[SPEAKER_00]: more like on the berry side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all in that kind of very similar
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the years, I think with a lot of
people, they've been muddled, mixed up,
[SPEAKER_00]: interchanged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where a lot of the confusion
comes from, because they do all have those
[SPEAKER_00]: similar notes in different varying
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always been difficult to kind of
verify which ones are which, unless you
[SPEAKER_00]: can trace them back to the original
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it's so important and people
don't get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can't trace it back to the original
person, you're almost playing in a way and
[SPEAKER_04]: always kind of just playing it,
trying to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even the American cut,
we can trace back to vision and then a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit past that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's just kind of like,
well, which one is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: We will never really know unless we have
like you come over in here and check it
[SPEAKER_04]: out and a few different grows so you can
see how different it is in each different
[SPEAKER_04]: grow and get an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is the bright side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think so?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is just because of the time
span.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he got it, it fits the time when
bright side had passed out to a few people
[SPEAKER_00]: and it then got passed on to a few more
within a short space of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I do remember during that
period, the crosses that were made with it
[SPEAKER_00]: and it being verified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for my money, I would put a strong
possibility on that being the legit one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know recently the bright side one's
been sourced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know psychosis has been sourced.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blues, AK, livers, that's been
sourced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it over here in the U.S., you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I should mention specifically Rest In
Paradise, Stoney, NYC, who died recently
[SPEAKER_00]: because he was one of the most elite
people as far as connecting genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: passing them to different people,
having a stable of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was one of the people that kept
things like the psychosis around.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got it sent to America recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it arrived the day he died and
it was saved by friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe that that cut has managed to
be salvaged and is over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoney would definitely want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy, honestly, when people realized
the part that he played in so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different seed companies, so many
different genetics, so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: forms, so many different things by
preserving and connecting people and
[SPEAKER_00]: passing genetics on, there's a whole
bunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was always trading, always trading.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just wouldn't have if it weren't for
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's going to super miss that guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the sour dub to him, and I think
that went out everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: F1 derb came back to us via Stoney.
[SPEAKER_00]: F1 derb, one of my friends has got the F1
derb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, he's got a Panama red that he wanted
me to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was heartbroken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Stoney's Panama.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually sent it to a mutual friend of
mine by mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friend has got the Panama red to
pass on to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like by sheer accident,
we got the Panama red.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had that one for a few years,
but I never bloomed it because it was so
[SPEAKER_04]: long.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sat in my veg for years,
just getting big as hell like Panamanians
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Stoney.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was so fast and random.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, it happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke to him on Friday and Tuesday he
died.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, that guy, I say, yeah,
this guy, he was like the two pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: clone trading because he put out so much
stuff that he died.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still coming out and landed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still receiving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's still happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even after he died, he was that busy that
weeks after, people are receiving
[SPEAKER_00]: packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No joke.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he passed and everyone came out,
I said, how did this guy have time for
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he was spending two hours a week
on the phone to me, three hours to English
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick, another three hours to this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was doing like a full-time job just
talking to 20 growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, he had a family and was doing the
normal life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, this guy did so much work in a
short space of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just such a beautiful human being.
[SPEAKER_04]: He lived it, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like me and you, just obsessed.
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we say this is 24-7, we go to sleep,
we're in bed texting each other,
[SPEAKER_04]: what do you think about this fucking
string?
[SPEAKER_04]: It just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's happy to do this podcast
now because normally I'll finish my
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is always nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll phone Stoney or have these
chats with people at midnight here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I'll be up till four in the
morning just talking about random old
[SPEAKER_00]: forum history and this part and that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's so easy to just lose
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about the past and different
characters that came and went.
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned something that was also
integral to my era because you came before
[SPEAKER_04]: me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were doing this shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were on the forums before I was.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were interacting with a lot of people,
but something we both had in common was
[SPEAKER_04]: the Canna Bible and how influential that
also was in our clone searchings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: To hear about all these different things,
to hear about these chem dogs,
[SPEAKER_00]: these OG kushes, these different cat piss,
dog shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these different things,
abusive OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, purps like Mendo purps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just purple in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was obsessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was obsessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted purple bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was desperate for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd seen the Blackberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Naboo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Naboo, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Naboo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that neon purple shit and I was
flipped out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have been obsessed forever till I
got my hands on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I needed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That drove a very big purple magenta
craze.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up with the S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Blackberry S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because remember, I think Gypsy Nirvana
took them off Oregon Kid and never paid
[SPEAKER_00]: them or some craze.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he then gave them away as freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew them out and had one that was that
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just had PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never had PM in my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had PM ever again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one plant in a small little shed
would get PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd wash it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: No other plant would get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never passed over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to wash it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was far broken.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet finding that and then being like,
what the fuck can I do with it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, a lot of that Blackberry stuff,
people didn't realize that it tends to dry
[SPEAKER_04]: brownish looking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not as pretty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smelled very dusty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just didn't keep the smell very well
from any of the Black Russian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a bit of licorice kind of flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bible was wild broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole thing, the photography,
to see such beautiful photographs was
[SPEAKER_00]: revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The descriptions, whether he was full of
shit or not, how much truth there was to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so beautifully written.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so detailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the time, even though looking back,
we can say this is accurate, this isn't,
[SPEAKER_04]: or we think this is less accurate or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the time, he still nailed it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard, even at this day and age,
to be like, I'm going to write a book and
[SPEAKER_04]: try to be as accurate as I can.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have a hard time being as accurate
as he was looking back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, back then, no one wanted to talk
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: To actually get people to discuss things
and take responsibility, now you'll get 20
[SPEAKER_00]: people claiming the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then, no one was claiming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all hush-hush and no one wanted no
one to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super different to how it was now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finding out later on, I remember reading
the Canter Bible and stuff and chasing
[SPEAKER_04]: this super dog and whatnot, and then later
on, becoming friends with Not-So-Dog and
[SPEAKER_04]: realizing he's one of the super dog guys,
and then he's the perp's guide to help
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason King with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, for me, yeah, it was at the pivotal
moment, was going to the Icy Mag Cup,
[SPEAKER_00]: the year that Rez, Smokey the Puff Master,
and Jimmy Nitz all entered the sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the year, like 2000, I believe,
six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, would have had to have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I believe six, and also at that was
the heads, Grateful Head and Mrs. King,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I loved those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They became like family to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never got to meet him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rez was a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rez was always a dick in real life to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had no desire to be cool with Rez,
but then what happened is they became
[SPEAKER_00]: friends with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was tight with them,
and the crazy thing was that as much as a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking shitbag as Rez was, he had all
these good people around him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smokey the Puff Master and his wife,
amazing people, the most beautiful people,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jimmy Nitz, the most insanely good grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to know what happened to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he was so burned and so
traumatized and so dragged into the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably put him off for life,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably had effects on his real life
in ways that he wasn't ready for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things got super crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that year there when I got to go
to Amsterdam, and all of a sudden I got to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke East Coast Sour Diesel grown by all
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rez's was trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: How similar were they between the three?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jimmy Nitz was by far the best grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was leaps and bounds above everyone
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the funny thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get on to later about the levels of
growers and the revelations as I started
[SPEAKER_00]: to find out what people were doing and
capable of what growth they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people talk smack about
Rez's growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you all about his growing a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what happened is I got real
friendly with the heads, and they gave me
[SPEAKER_00]: the Casey Jones seeds later on when they
went back to America.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That then was my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing out a bunch of head
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew out the Casey Jones.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2007, I turned up with the Casey Jones
from seed, entered it, and got second
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got second place to JLP who entered Sour
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: JLP, for anyone who doesn't know,
John Lee Pedermore.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy is a legend beyond levels,
beyond levels, beyond levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy must have given out a million
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the only person that was allowed to
get addresses from people on Overgrow,
[SPEAKER_00]: ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every forum that he was on, they would
allow him to interact with growers
[SPEAKER_00]: directly, like ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the only person that could get
addresses and send seeds to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you'd be in trouble for that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: JLP, he would do all kinds of crazy F2s
and hybrids and all stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because he was doing a lot of F2s and
things like that, he never sold anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just gave the seeds away.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you would get is a little envelope
with one of those little round discs with
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back, it would say 21 Jump Street
as the return address because his name was
[SPEAKER_00]: John Lee Pedermore, JLP, and there's some
connection in a TV show or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know this as an English person,
but years later, I found this out years
[SPEAKER_00]: later just out of curiosity about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed it somewhere and this guy gave
out just constantly to thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, he'd send seeds out.
[SPEAKER_04]: His own money too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of genetics that he gave out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to know what happened to him
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many dudes that have just-
Yeah, there are.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome when people do pop back up on
Instagram and find people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew out that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I won the IC Mag Cup, the second
place, not long after that, I went out to
[SPEAKER_00]: Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see the composer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as everyone now knows, Maine is
where Rez, the heads and everyone involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in that crazy shit was living.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heads were like family to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the thing, yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: The heads, this is what breaks my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the heads got caught up in a
crazy thing and they cooperated with the
[SPEAKER_00]: authorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are like family to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mrs. Head and the kid came to England,
stayed at my house because Dutch-grown was
[SPEAKER_00]: such a cunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left her house and come and stayed at
my house when they visited England.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we became really tight because
Dutch-grown was such a cunt to them that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, just come and stay at my house and
I'll go and stay at my cousin's house.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the folks who don't know, Dutch-grown
was a ex-cop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ex-cop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, Karen, ex-cop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had that confirmed by two different
people as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first person that told me was someone
who worked for Gypsy was told by Pom,
[SPEAKER_00]: plural of mongoose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Mrs. Head was told by Karen's
mum.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, that'll solve it real fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one is the fucking 100%
confirmation that there's no denying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, what breaks my heart is
that I know how the domino effect went.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time it got to the heads,
they're the only ones that actually had
[SPEAKER_00]: kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutch-grown had nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rez, nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time they got to the heads and
the other two had all rolled, there was
[SPEAKER_00]: nowhere else for them to go other than to
roll too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, they were only rolling on
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sad thing is, the heads had fallen
out of Rez because they realised what a
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic person he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the saddest part of all,
is that they had broken away from him
[SPEAKER_00]: almost a year prior to that and had
nothing to do with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when he got busted, I'm sure he had no
qualms in dragging them into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference between them is that
their heads have never come back onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: scene because they feel so burnt,
so hurt, so ashamed, so sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So distressed by the whole thing that they
don't feel that they have a place back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for these other people who are rats to
think that they can come back in is crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mindfucking.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's weird, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't think the heads would have
an issue coming back in these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I wish they would.
[SPEAKER_04]: They openly snitch on people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like, they're actually good people,
but they openly snitch on people that are
[SPEAKER_04]: real bad people that people still support
to this day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to me, it's like, if they have guilt
over that and shit, like, we know how it
[SPEAKER_04]: went down.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know how everybody folded.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know how it all wrapped up at this
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, we know who the real bad
people are in that whole situation and who
[SPEAKER_04]: weren't, who were the victims of the
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can imagine, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go out to America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm staying with the heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go meet Rez.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy is the biggest breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's moving 80,000 cells on a weekend
drop.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the DNA of America.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, online he's a prick,
but obviously I've got some reverence for
[SPEAKER_00]: him because he's doing good work and I can
see what he's got is quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown out some of his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some fire there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm not a fool to what he's putting
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like everyone knows at the time,
there was certain stuff he had that no one
[SPEAKER_00]: else did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, if you wanted to grow this
stuff, regardless of his character,
[SPEAKER_00]: you had to get it from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had high expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I went there, bro, I'll be honest
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people say that he had a shitty
little bro, he didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a beautiful bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: His bro was underground, beautifully
hidden, all nice lights, separate veg
[SPEAKER_00]: room, all the lights, ventilation for the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it was, any people that chat shit,
really, the guy's a cunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But his bro room worked terrible,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he got the workers to come in and
people done stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said, this guy didn't know
what the fuck he was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all by chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got to where he did, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went to a local grow shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had New York City Diesel from Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the grow shop guy had the East Coast
Sour Diesel cut and swapped him for Soma's
[SPEAKER_00]: New York City Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the birth of Rez making it,
just by that one person giving him that
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is...
[SPEAKER_00]: Just by accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I went to his house one time,
bro, his whole crop was just covered in
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, bro, your crop's covered in
PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm like, nah, surely this
motherfucker I'm looking to to tell me
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff knows what PM is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure enough, he didn't have a fucking
clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a lot of these reading was the
blind leading the blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had other people doing projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like the other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was saying, oh, this guy's a buffoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This while I was there once a house burnt
down, like we were growing it like crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: shit happened, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the house is burning down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were like, everyone's worried,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just sounds like a clusterfuck waiting
to happen over there with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give someone enough good genetics,
no matter how much of a clusterfuck they
[SPEAKER_00]: are, they'll do some good work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's real.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Swerve.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing was where he really hit gold
is when he had someone like Grateful Head
[SPEAKER_00]: around all of a sudden Grateful Head was
doing the real fucking hard work and the
[SPEAKER_00]: selections and the and the solid work.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to a lot of the chem work,
it was like the original cross to the was
[SPEAKER_00]: it the Hindu Kush, he done it too?
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_04]: A Hindu Kush or M39, one of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: He done the first cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the back cross is in further
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the chem stuff was done by Grateful
Head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what was happening, his head was
doing some chem stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was doing some sour stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone else was doing some other stuff
and they had different projects
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I say, a lot of the things from
Rez, it was all hit and miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one of the, do you remember when he
done his first fem project, when it was
[SPEAKER_00]: abusive reverse?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't remember that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they fucked up the room and the
abusive perm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just thought fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's release them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was some of these best work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I was over there, bro, I got to see
so much genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine coming from England and
having tried a couple cuts here and there,
[SPEAKER_00]: tried some crosses, tried some OG Kush
S1s, tried little bits and pieces,
[SPEAKER_00]: tried some different cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I'm on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking the East Coast salad diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking all the chem family that
ChemDog had that time and passed on to
[SPEAKER_00]: Rez.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus we're smoking everything that Jimmy
Nitz was having around that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was also getting all the stuff from OG
Rascal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was smoking everything from the
Romulence to the Gisels to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked Massachusetts Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked SnowDog, ChemSista, Chem4,
all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, ChemD, that's the goat for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have such fondness for her.
[SPEAKER_04]: Has that made it over to the UK in cut
form?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I believe a couple of people have
got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't verified it or known who it's
come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in recent years, hearing how many fake
ones there are, I'm getting my one from my
[SPEAKER_00]: own source rather than getting the one
that's already here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wish we had an easier way to get
stuff across the plot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It still sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not really good at tissue
culture, it's still a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really where we're at now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, people are picking up on the
tissue culture thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never got good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got people in Barcelona that are
getting onto the tissue culture now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So slowly but surely, things are coming
together with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just makes it so much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can really preserve all these genetics
for a common.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times have you had to get rid of
a genetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's like, how many mums can you
actually keep?
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, it was a very different
place we were living in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many times, I always used to have a
hit list of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a new one to come in, it had to be
better than one of the ones that fitted a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain aspect of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for me, cannabis is about a
feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love flavors, but I smoke cannabis
because of how it makes me feel and what
[SPEAKER_00]: it does for my personality, character,
my well-being, my feeling of wellness,
[SPEAKER_00]: my health, pain medication, all of these
kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to try all the different things,
that's kind of the real key thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's rare, dude, for a guy from the
UK to be able to say, I had to,
[SPEAKER_04]: I smoked the Camcys, I smoked the Giselle,
I smoked the Snow Dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because people listening now, I think that
come into cannabis later, they've always
[SPEAKER_04]: assumed that these things just make it
across the pond super easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in, I remember in 2007, I was trying
to get clones to someone in Spain and it
[SPEAKER_04]: was super hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were spending tons of money trying to
do this before we were really,
[SPEAKER_04]: Ford Tissue Culture was really an option
even at that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were trying super hard and we spent
tons of cash trying to get it there and it
[SPEAKER_04]: just didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just made me think, yeah, the amount of
time that I picked up boxes from the post
[SPEAKER_00]: office that was just like soaking wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, who, how the fuck did
you send this to me, international?
[SPEAKER_00]: The things just coming through like,
what have you fucking done?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're shocked that it didn't get you
popped.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course, the thing that could
have gotten you popped, you opened it up
[SPEAKER_04]: and it smells like wet cooked lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, all my first lot, I think like the
first two or three attempts that we had
[SPEAKER_00]: all died.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't until like towards probably
2009, around 2009, we started getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more luck with the cuts coming over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because basically, to finish off where I
was going, what ended up happening is that
[SPEAKER_00]: after a while you realize that res doesn't
do a lot of the breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he hits me up and says to me,
do you want to do a seed project?
[SPEAKER_00]: So up until that point, I had such high
regard for breeders that I never even
[SPEAKER_00]: thought about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew friends that had done a little
project, this, that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this was such a high level thing
that for me, I was still learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about cannabis, I was still trying to
try everything that I wanted to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't feel that I knew enough about
everything to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a fair, fair way of looking at
it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, but that being said by this
stage, when I done the project or started
[SPEAKER_00]: to do a project for res at this stage,
we're talking 2009 now, I think I had
[SPEAKER_00]: motor breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Jimmy Knits was my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had those seeds before they even had
a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a motor breath cut that to this
day, I think was better than Chem D,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Terps and better than OG Krusch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the perfect two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't tried the motor breath 15,
but if it's anything like the keeper that
[SPEAKER_00]: we had at Connoisseur genetics at the time
that I selected, that's one of the top
[SPEAKER_00]: five cuts I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of the stuff Jimmy Knits done.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the people that changed my
mind for Feminise Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I had Strain Red Cross SFV and the
Chem Cross SFV from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had Abusive Cross Diesel, Original
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had lots of elite stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a stable of maybe 15 mothers at that
stage with a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then res wanted me to do the Chem IBL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I think I still got seeded at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, because this is the thing,
res had been burnt so much by giving out
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts to people that even people who were
meant to be his friend like me,
[SPEAKER_00]: that he had promised cuts to, he didn't
want to give them to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like res was a weirdo.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point, I remember res promising
someone a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That person went to a mutual friend's
house said, Oh, is that the cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because res said I could get one,
but he didn't have none ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy goes, yeah, yeah, that's the
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And res didn't really want him to have the
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then res drove to the house and
poisoned the cup with coke while the guy
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't looking to try and kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that by the time he got home,
it died because he didn't really want him
[SPEAKER_00]: to have the cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's just above and beyond.
[SPEAKER_04]: Loovy shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's just being a coward,
just like I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, looking back, that's why I
realized, oh, that's why you wanted me to
[SPEAKER_00]: do the IBL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because with the IBL, he didn't have to
send me the Chem V cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: All he needed to do was give me Chem BX2
and say to me, oh, get the best females,
[SPEAKER_00]: hit them with the best males, IBL,
done.
Done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the thing, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sparked a fascination with selecting
males for me because that was something
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like normally when a good male
pops up, you're pissed off and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now all of a sudden I did like 30,
40 C's which was a high population for
[SPEAKER_00]: back then and living where I'm living and
selected out three insane males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these males are insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had the seed project going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as what often happens in a
prohibition era, a house got robbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I lost everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rez was just a piece of shit about the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of during that period that I
kind of like phased out from him and
[SPEAKER_00]: realized like, oh, you're just a cunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like their heads had cut him off.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was acting like a little bitch about
certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: He basically blocked me from getting the
sourdise or from crazy composer who was a
[SPEAKER_00]: mutual friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, that's sad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I talked about that last episode for
people who don't understand, like people
[SPEAKER_04]: would lock specific people out of cuts
just to be dicks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that was a thing that people did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was really annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, it's really annoying when you've been
at the guy's house and you've had bread
[SPEAKER_00]: with him and you're meant to be like
family to the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden you realize,
oh, no, you're just out to serve yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're just using everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when push comes to shove, you ain't
got no loyalty and you're just a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: viking, popping douchebag who ended up
being a rat at the end of it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only good thing come out of it is that
by the time that project went,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the most incredible males and now I
was excited about seeing what would happen
[SPEAKER_00]: if I bred them to all of my stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now I'm like, oh, I've got a
stable of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got these males that just have to be
bred with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to breed with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of the spot for me to
want to breed for myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And was that the first actual breeding
project or did the males get robbed and
[SPEAKER_04]: that was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know, actually, bro, this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I then had a breeding project ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine was selling some bugs to
someone he knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came to get the bug turned up with
two other guys, pulled a gun on him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically it was almost a hostage
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got out of the shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard the room go silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like the guys came in and they
went to the back room and I'm getting dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden I just felt an energy
shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: From another room, I felt an energy shift
through the wall room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I walk out of the door, turn left to
look into the other door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I do, the geezer turns and he's got
a little 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the small little woman's gun?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he shot someone point blank in the
head and never killed him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my fucking God.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only a 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen that and run for the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in these old Victorian houses,
they often have two doors, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the little porch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the fuck I've done is put the
latch up so that as I go to open the door,
[SPEAKER_00]: it wouldn't turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, I unlatched it, went through the
first one, got through the second one,
[SPEAKER_00]: run out, jumped the gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's like three o'clock in the
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stood wrapping myself back up in the
towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this cunt stood there with the 22 in
the doorway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, bro, you better fucking make
a move because I'm going to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making a scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three of them run out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've had people running out of
the house with a gun, bags of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got to grow upstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm in a situation where I'm like,
fuck, I've got to get all of these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, I've got a friend at the
time who was breeding and had a little
[SPEAKER_00]: seed company called Connoisseur Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hit him up and say to him,
bro, if you've got somewhere that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: look after some plants, because I've got
these big plants, I'm about to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: project and I don't want to lose all the
genetics and I can't keep them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's like, yeah, we can figure
something out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my dad, who's like normal working guy,
not a smoker, just a normal guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I end up having to get him to come and
help me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We moved fucking 36 big fucking five foot
tall plants in TV boxes on their side.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're mad ones like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Connoisseur Genetics just
decided, fuck it, I'm going to pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: your project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just fucking made the seeds with my
whole selection, with all my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just done the seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: He decided, fuck keeping your things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's kind of him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just wanted to see your project for
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: How did that work out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, so my mind being too blown,
I'm like, what's wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: I might as well come in with you on
Connoisseur Genetics, bear it in mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: the only seed blinds he'd ever done were
G13 haze crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the G13 haze was a mail that someone
else gave him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Soma's mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy didn't know really about no
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was breeding niche little weird haze
things that no one really cared about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember it was like, there was like a
purple bastard haze, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Titan's haze, which was something like
Titanic cross G13 haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some weird little niche haze
things with weird names.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also like weird SSSDH G13 haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all of a sudden, my line drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come in, brand it, I get him
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get logos.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start naming things proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we hit a time when things were hot
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connoisseur Genetics back then,
when we dropped that Chem BX line,
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Chem, Secret Recipe, Cheese Dog,
Chemmy Jones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was so much fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where we really hit it was that the
people that test for our stuff were just
[SPEAKER_00]: legends of the game now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking back at it, the people that test
for Connoisseur Genetics now, I look up to
[SPEAKER_00]: because of what they're doing in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like those people inspire me now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how that works, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, it's nuts because I'm telling you,
these people are doing crazy things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember when they were doing test
pros for Connoisseur Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That chem line hit and that one was just
wild, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We done so well with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we kind of had to phase into the
femlite stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the market demanded it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it demanded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It broke into full distribution,
attitude, all of those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like regs weren't really doing it
no more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of, that era phased out and it was
more feminized stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one thing I'll say,
yeah, because it's always a contentious
[SPEAKER_00]: issue where OJ from Connoisseur Genetics
always likes to come out and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, he never made no seeds during that
time, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my hands up now and say,
the first batch of seeds I didn't make.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was my male selection and my
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never made the seeds, but I did all the
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I then remade a batch of those seeds
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it came to feminized seeds,
I only ever done two feminized reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was a GDP and one was Girl Scout
Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GDP one, I only did a few little
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them got released from Connoisseur
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some got released from Truecana Genetics
as I broke away onto my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what eventually happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what happens, which you have to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because yeah, Connoisseur Genetics we were
working together for a year or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went to go to Amsterdam to
enter the high times with the ChemCrosses,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the ChemDX stuff that we'd done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were ready to go enter that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got busted going to the high times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both of you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of us got busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how did that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got busted leaving the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's all us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the life lesson on that one,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end of it, we ended up doing six
months in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: The six months in prison was just tedious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all it taught me is that OJ,
my business partner, was not my kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was locked up in a cell with him
and it was just a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I was going to ask that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have to spend time with him the
whole time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, it was a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked so much the day that we got
sentenced because we knew they said to us
[SPEAKER_00]: like, yeah, you're getting banged up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got an hour, then come back and
they're going to sentence you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went and smoked about 10 grams in
like five joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come back in stone to the bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But three months into the sentence,
he got piss tested and failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three months later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three months later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got shipped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be honest with you, it was the
best thing that ever happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minute they fucked him off out of our
prison, my life got easier because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we come out of prison,
I tried for a little while to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when you've been through so
much, I was overlooking the fact that the
[SPEAKER_00]: guy talks to people like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been through a traumatic experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just disrespectful to people,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, I was like, man,
how can I break away from this after we've
[SPEAKER_00]: tried so much?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been through so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to prison together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've maintained the business while we
were in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we had other people making seeds for
us while we were in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were like on the phone telling my dad,
yeah, this is the name for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad was getting the seeds, packaging
them, taking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were still running a seed company from
prison in 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, when I came out,
we had a grotesque time together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going for the high times again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically we got to the point where I
was living in a grow house while on
[SPEAKER_00]: probation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the geezers having a shout in argument
with me in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I can't part with this no
more because I'm like, I have a fight me
[SPEAKER_00]: or have an adult conversation,
but I'm not going to scream and shout,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially not when I've got a liquor and
sleep here and there's a grove here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need this in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally about three weeks before the
crop was done, I spoke to a mutual friend
[SPEAKER_00]: and said to them, look, bro, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm walking away from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you just help him with the last
little bit and finish all this off?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I walked away from it completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never asked for nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I tried to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to salvage a friendship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to say to him like, look,
I've lined up someone to come in and help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to do none of the same seed
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go in a different direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to be super cool about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still the geezer was so bitter that he
still backstabbed me and done a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: snappy things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got my own little cousin to steal genetics
from me, ruin the grove that he was
[SPEAKER_00]: looking after for me, and then do a
project for Connoisseur genetics with the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that he stole from me,
i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: the triangle cushion, the Girl Scout
cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he just did scumbag stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, when I called him out on
it, he said, no, honestly, I'd never do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know he'd done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then three months later, my little
cousin couldn't keep his mouth shut and
[SPEAKER_00]: went telling everyone that he got paid the
money for the seed project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a dirt bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a dirt bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it spurred me to start true kind of
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went out on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I entered ICMAG again with the TK.
[SPEAKER_00]: My cousin entered with the Tertzilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the year after coming out of prison,
we got first and second place at the ICMAG
[SPEAKER_00]: Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: What year was that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like 2013, I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe 14.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking A, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a long storied career, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy, because you know who it was,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're from that era where high
times, I know everyone talks shit about
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone says, oh, the awards are bought
and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from an era where winning are high
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That meant something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our era, we were all fighting for
third place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between us, we all kind of felt that first
and second was for the big spenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that they bought the
awards, but what I'm saying is the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that spend a lot of money have got the
best bud a lot of the time and the best
[SPEAKER_00]: push and the best promotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put themselves in a position to
win on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the smaller companies are fighting for
a third place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the way it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, at one point, Arjan got
blocked from going to the Cup because he
[SPEAKER_04]: bribed the judges openly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, I mean, these things happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: People would, as I explained it,
even today, you pay for events,
[SPEAKER_04]: you pay for parties for high times,
you pay for ad, then you get the articles,
[SPEAKER_04]: then you get this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not a one-to-one exchange like
people would think.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to buy this cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say I never paid for sponsorship or
bought any high times judges cocaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've heard that those two things
work favorably well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never had to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been banned the whole time,
but I assume that if one wanted to do it,
[SPEAKER_04]: coke would be a good choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: People were fighting for third place at
every point because it was either Barney's
[SPEAKER_04]: Farm or Greenhouse or Greenhouse or
Barney's Farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was kind of the dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like the year we came out of
prison, I broke away from conical
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conical genetics went and entered the high
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never got to fulfill my dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried the next year, failed again
because I got kicked out of the house
[SPEAKER_00]: where I had to grow, had to take dry
plants to another house to dry them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then had to send the bud to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole experience aggravated me so
much that I didn't even want to enter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like just disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I decided did you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way I'm going to win at high
times is if I grow the fucking plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam, trim it, put it into
Tupperware, walk the Tupperware up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: judge and hand it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I decided, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I moved to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just left everything, left my life,
left my family, left everything and moved
[SPEAKER_00]: to Amsterdam with the dream of winning the
high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was my next mission.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a fucking wild one that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go there, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, I had just started an extract
company, OCD Labs, because we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: like around 2012-13, we started OCD Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the first across international into
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it to the UK without a shadow of a
doubt, no matter what anyone else claims
[SPEAKER_00]: on the scene, because I've heard other
claims.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the first people to have an across
international in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got Mortimer says, the secret cup
winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a girl called Mortimer says she
won secret cup around 2012 or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I paid for her to come to the UK to show
us single solvent de-waxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we were open blasting,
but we learned single solvent de-waxing
[SPEAKER_00]: where you would freeze on dry ice,
fill a Buckner funnel, all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were so ahead of the curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what ended up happening is when I
moved to Amsterdam, I took the oven whip
[SPEAKER_00]: with me and we started the extract company
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the thing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the extract company running and we
were kind of building an extract culture
[SPEAKER_00]: because we couldn't sell extracts in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we used to do is sit in coffee
shops, dab in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when people would pay attention,
we'd be like, do you want to dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden we'd give them
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that would spread on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 10 years later, about 10 of those
people have got businesses in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their lives have been affected wonderfully
by being in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've got amazing stories of their
own to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during that time, I had a grow,
as you can imagine, we started grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working with a coffee shop,
had some nice carts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting ready for the high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my Turbzilla cart, which is a NYC
from Soma, the Ruby Red Grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cup across to the Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the ICMAG cup with that cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was going to enter that into the high
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a grow with the Forum Girl Scout
cookies as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, big shout out to the Always
Be Flowering and all of those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way early on, I'd get looked after like a
king by all of my ICMAG friends.
Dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that is very early for people to
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I come out of prison, 2011,
I got a message from a certain member of
[SPEAKER_00]: that crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't say his name because obviously he
sent me the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ain't going to be beating him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the crew said, look,
we love what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had grown a lot of our stuff and was a
big fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, you've got something special
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within three days, I had like 12
rooted carts and 12 unrooted carts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was so rare for that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like so rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I'm telling you, 2012, it must have
been London.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000 a kilo for Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus, I bet too, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could move it for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the guy who would move it would
double up and make 20 selling it in grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, in grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And say, whoa, people are going mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting people coming and buying like
21 grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people's minds have never seen
nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they'd never seen this kind of bud
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's times when bud impact the world
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one, it hit at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is why, when I'm now in Amsterdam,
have my bro, everything's veg and
[SPEAKER_00]: beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden the bro gets robbed for
the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Amsterdam, of course it did.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Amsterdam, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: They robbed it for the fucking genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't even in flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, it was in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all very suspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the next, I wake up, you tell me if
there's a coincidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wake up in the morning because I go to
the bro two times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to go to the bro in the morning and
the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looked like I was living there
because I was painting a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you live in a place where you're not
meant to be growing, what I always used to
[SPEAKER_00]: say to people, if you paint a picture for
the surrounding people, their imaginations
[SPEAKER_00]: won't paint a picture that paints you into
a corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing normal stuff,
show them shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show them a toolbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show them a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Play the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just be a fucking idiot about it and
get lapsed the days in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't show up in a Corvette like once a
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I played the game properly at this
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going all great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning time, I go to my car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I've got a flat tire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a nail in my tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I holler at the guy who I'm doing the
project with.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, yeah, you can go around the
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this place here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tire shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go walk there and get the tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as I get back, change the tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just getting ready to leave the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get a phone call from my business
partner's brother, who's a dodgy fucker at
[SPEAKER_00]: the best of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Says to me, where are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, okay, stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to speak to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comes, pulls out his phone and goes,
yeah, the place got raided last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shows me the news article.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that morning of the police loading
the Grove out of the block of flats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, I rode it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my part.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've done everything that I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I'm like, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm heartbroken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've lost everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to say to the geezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes sour with my business partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's aggravated about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, bro, I did work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put in money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both lost out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've lost my genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: High times is like 10 weeks, 11 weeks away
from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, don't look at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that all goes sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm left with such a short amount of
time that the only thing I can do is pop a
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of each seeds I've got, veg them for
two weeks, flour for six days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drive for 14 days, three days,
hand into high times on the fourth day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just barely enough time to cram one in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then listen to this for ironic while
I'm in my new apartment, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: different that because I've moved it where
I coincidentally moved into a new spot at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time that was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm in my new spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to the mall across the street in
north of Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a pedestrianized mall.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I walk into the mall area, an American
woman who lived in the flat below where
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow was, sees me and looks at me and
clocks me straight away and goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, hello, can I have a word with you,
please?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: This woman lived below where the grow was
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck, what is this woman going to say to
me?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I walk over to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She goes, first of all, can I shake your
hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's the grow you had.
[SPEAKER_00]: She goes, I'm also a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: She goes, but those apartments,
you can't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then she goes on to tell me,
yeah, just so you know, it was two
[SPEAKER_00]: Moroccan guys that robbed the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard them kick the door off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked out and saw them come down with
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: She goes, I'm not sure what plants you
had, but they seem very keen to take your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that were still in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: This woman sees them leave and rip the veg
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: She goes, I obviously called the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that happens, I can't just leave the
grow open like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't have your details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I just wanted to let you know what
the situation was in future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to grow, you need to grow
in apartments like that one over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she points at the block that I'm now
living in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So she saw the Moroccan dudes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So was your business partner, did he have
any Moroccan or have a lot of Moroccan
[SPEAKER_04]: connects?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's Moroccan.
[SPEAKER_00]: His brother wanted the genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Amsterdam, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you know what it was?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had told his brother, look, I think I've
got broad minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm battling them at the moment with
Swarovski might and a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to take them, you're more than
welcome to, but trust me, if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with it properly, it will ruin you
and everything that comes in touch with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that he thought I didn't want
to give it to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he never pursued it further.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he would have said, OK, I'll take the
risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have said, go on, take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think in his head, he built up that
I was bullshitting him and then just
[SPEAKER_00]: robbed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully he got broad minds, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the funny thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Months and months later, I saw a picture
posted by someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it side by side to my turpzilla and
said to a friend, what does that look
[SPEAKER_00]: like?
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, that one looks like that one,
but with broad minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my fucking God.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, yeah, I genuinely don't
believe that my business partner at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time had anything to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually think if it was because I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was definitely nothing to do with my
business partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lost out bigger than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He fucking put money into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This poor guy was heartbroken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we fell out because he was just so
heartbroken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I never held no feeling to
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I can see he was annoyed,
but it's like, bro, who do you blame?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he lost out himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I ended the high times with with
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I entered a few different things and the
truth got me a second place, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most shocking day of my life,
I swear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You jumped third and took a second,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I swear to you, as they announced
third and it went to someone else,
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at my cousin and said,
well, we've had fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they named me a second and shot
just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, total shock, because like I say,
third place was an achievement to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: second place was wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that meant the world to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who got first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest prick of all friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swear.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even worse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, that's like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really like anybody from our era knows
that like, you know, it was like a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary that ended with him and they
end up like father's gift or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like basically there's the Baba
Kushner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won first place with a Baba Kush
entry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Swerve had to go to Ohio to get his Baba
Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't even get one in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that story.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another I see bad guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And down to that by over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just saw him yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a J.D.
[SPEAKER_04]: Short post about how J.D.
[SPEAKER_04]: Short thought Baba Kush was blueberry and
Swerve was in there cosigning it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just like, what is going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I entered a Twilight fun in town,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you made it through.
[SPEAKER_04]: You made it through to Amsterdam.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, you got your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam was it was like it was a wild
period in Amsterdam because extracts were
[SPEAKER_00]: just becoming a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were running extracts for DNA,
for soma, for a few different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenofinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was a few different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is an amazing time to be in
Amsterdam, to be growing culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be entering competitions, to be dabbing
people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, no exaggeration, I've probably
given maybe 500 to 1,000 people
[SPEAKER_00]: conservatively their first ever dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people did you see white out for
the first time?
[SPEAKER_00]: None, because I was trying to build a
culture and sell slabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think I will?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single person I ever dabbed,
do you know what they said?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I always did the perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were already thinking low temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were already onto that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were trying to get it as enjoyable
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't want people coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't want it to be a bad experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone was doing stupid shit,
making people cough and making it
[SPEAKER_00]: uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want someone to say, yeah, give me 10
grams or get a 30 gram slab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want them to cough their guts up
and never come back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen people totally be turned off to
cannabis from their first dab because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: just too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: For people going from not smoking at all
to getting a one gram dab, that'll kill
[SPEAKER_04]: someone's mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember my friends at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends the previous night have hung
out with Wiz Khalifa and been smoking and
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing with Wiz Khalifa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next day they're so gassed up about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at the Bordeaux coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had done an edible earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all of a sudden, for some reason,
my friend put his whole slab of oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking a slab like a gram of oil,
like a rat, on the dab bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking to myself, what's he
doing with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, oh, you've got to do a big dab
like we were doing yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking to myself, you've never
done the dab that big in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to give me your oil to do
a big dab like that, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done those kinds of dabs and it's
like, me, I've got an iron lung.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've managed to do those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most interesting time and the biggest
test of the iron lung was when Tony Vazura
[SPEAKER_00]: and Bubble Man bought Terps to Amsterdam
the first year that Blue River had
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were doing Terp chasers where they
were dabbing stiff and doing a whole drop
[SPEAKER_00]: of terpenes onto the rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm telling you, that felt like what I
imagine a 10 gram rock of crack would feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like your whole, it could not be healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like looking back at it, a single drip of
terpenes onto a dab could not be healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but my god, it was tasty and terpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a shadow of a doubt, everyone
coughed like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something people weren't holding
on like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just crazy potency on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the most hardest kind of lock onto
your chest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever, I'm sure you've done
whippets before, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever had vanilla flavored gas
whippets?
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I highly recommend never ever doing it
because what it is, it's a special kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: gas that's vanilla flavored, not vanilla
liquid added.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you do it and go to do the
whippet, you inhale this whole other gas
[SPEAKER_04]: and it makes your lungs just crack.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would imagine that's a lot like the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it felt like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like something that should not be in
your lungs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could probably kill you if you inhale
it because it's not oxygen and it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: not enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything else there, it could,
it could jack you up pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was such a fun time,
like in Amsterdam, because we saw during
[SPEAKER_00]: that period, there was like, it was during
the transition where BHO was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden Rosin got
discovered during that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of a sudden Rosin era came in and
then what ended up happening with me is as
[SPEAKER_00]: I won the high times at the end of 2014,
I then went on a trip to Morocco on a
[SPEAKER_00]: reconnaissance mission because the people
of Morocco were curious what was left on
[SPEAKER_00]: the material after all the hash had
covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because imagine if you have five tons of
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden there's 7% oil on it,
BHO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what it ended up being.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were two different strains that I
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was giving 4% and the other
one was giving 7%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could get 7% oil return off of the
plant material that they were making in
[SPEAKER_00]: Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were looking at different methods
of like in Morocco, one of the issues that
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to harvest things dry it and
then wait for things to get cold so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can then process it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the evolutions that come into
Morocco is to get a generator to air
[SPEAKER_00]: condition and refrigerate the room where
you work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you can process your whole crop,
make your money, then go to your neighbor,
[SPEAKER_00]: offer them a fraction of what their crops
worth to take off of them a month or two
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they've got no work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get paid early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take it to your facility and you
process it and put it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's much better quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was one of their evolutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start to notice like all these
different evolutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one obviously was the feminized
seeds in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where what would happen is one farmer
would grow feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what would happen is the
neighboring farm would see the quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: that crop and they would be interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what would happen is this farmer who
had paid, say, a euro per seed or
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds, they would sell all of
their material to the other farmer who
[SPEAKER_00]: would now get Moroccan hybrid Dutch
genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just take the plant material,
throw it down like they normally would.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it would mean is that their crop
would be such a percentage more the next
[SPEAKER_00]: year that they got enough money that the
following year they bought feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: God, yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they passed on to the next farms
and it would spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were getting a little bit more
yield by getting hybrid regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they got the cash influx from
that regular seed hybrids, they would then
[SPEAKER_00]: invest with the extra money in feminize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was how it spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone begun to grow feminize,
feminize, feminize.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how DNA took over Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA, the Spanish brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouse, like a lot of, let's be
honest, a lot of the first time I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: it happening, I'll give you my theory,
you tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first hash that I remember coming back
from Morocco that was named was chem dog
[SPEAKER_00]: hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was when Greenhouse tried to do a
chem dog seed line and it was over that so
[SPEAKER_00]: they couldn't sell the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened to the seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: It went to Morocco and they made hash out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the real start of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was feminize seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That couldn't be sold on the regular
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they then decided to sell them to
Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the true beginning of the
Moroccans buying feminize seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why weren't they able to sell it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why weren't they able to sell the chem
dog?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was just her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think wherever they come with the chem
dog line, it was just such a herm line.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't able to release the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a few other ones that were kind
of were out at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you kind of notice that that was what
the hash was that was coming from Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what people have done over the
years is given the stuff that didn't do
[SPEAKER_00]: well went to Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now people are a little bit more fussy
with what they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but they're just probably finding
the new Morocco right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Thailand or wherever.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a weird evolution for Morocco
because they kind of like they got too
[SPEAKER_00]: carried away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had some good hash making strains and
they thought everything that's new is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be good.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all resin is equal and not all resin
is good for dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all resin has a bunch of oil in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about to say, that's the problem,
bro, is that what's happened over the last
[SPEAKER_00]: few years being in Spain, Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you see a lot of it is that you'll get
the blocks of hash from Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been backsealed and where they
haven't been able to dry the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the resin is a greasy type of resin
that has more water content than the sandy
[SPEAKER_00]: type of resin that is traditionally used.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you didn't backseal it and it's left
for an amount of time, it ferments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole thing scrolls up and when you
open the block, it's just rotten and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just gone off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like fermented.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that fermented hash is brutal too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the things they're
having to now be a lot more selective with
[SPEAKER_00]: what genetics they take to Morocco rather
than just thinking, oh, it's got a Z in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone will want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden it's greasy as
fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't get it off the plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They beat it and get fucking coffee and
just have a bunch of greasy moldy hash
[SPEAKER_00]: when it arrives at destiny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Lord.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not all resin is equal for each
environment and each extraction method.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for damn sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we get to Morocco with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the next step?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the next step in your evolution to
where you're at now?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was then to go to Spain because
Amsterdam, as much as I love Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_00]: the culture there to grow is just,
it doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like so suspicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your neighbor will knock on the door when
you arrive and ask them who you are and
[SPEAKER_00]: what you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the most invasive people I've ever
known in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can live with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason I got away with growing in
the place that I did is because my
[SPEAKER_00]: landlord was from Iran and he was like
this beautiful Iranian guy that left in
[SPEAKER_00]: the like conflict in the eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: He like rode to the border on the
motorbike from his parents with bullets
[SPEAKER_00]: and shot at him and had bullet holes where
he got shot fleeing Iran.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy was an OG bro, but he loved me
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point we had the vacuum oven in
the, in the downstairs kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we didn't realize is when you
turn the light on, it was putting a little
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction fan on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we were fucking running the oven,
all the turps that were coming out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking pump were going into the
extraction fan and going through every
[SPEAKER_00]: apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the guy, bro, he comes to us and he
goes, look, whatever you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do it in the front of the house
because it's scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting complaints from the neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could have like just kicked me out
because he's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, if you let someone grow in your
house, they'll take your house from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They, yeah, it's that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like brutal out there bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they took big risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after, after the Morocco trip,
it was literally a point of going to
[SPEAKER_00]: Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a bunch of opportunities that all
fell apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was, I was in, I was invited here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already had plans to come to Barcelona,
but I got invited on a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: promises and projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I got here, that all fell apart
and I ended up having to salvage things on
[SPEAKER_00]: my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was quite an adventure, but getting
to Barcelona, getting set up here and
[SPEAKER_00]: being a part of the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like the moment I had a smuggling
conviction and I couldn't be in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed to be in the next best place for
the culture or who I am and for what I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do with my life and Spain and
Barcelona for Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the, it's at this point, the
epicenter of the cannabis culture and the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it's the perfect place to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what led me here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I envy it bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's like my Mecca to make it to
Spain just cause it seems so awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's like anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has its ups and downs, but the pace of
life is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people are just so blase.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next door neighbors, like on one side,
I've got neighbors that are a family that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's like the mum and dad are
probably a little bit younger than my
[SPEAKER_00]: parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got kids, everything from like 14
to in their twenties, grow underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: their house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they grow in their back garden on the
other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an elderly couple one year,
the elderly couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my plants got blown over in a storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old man who must be 70 odd called me
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: He saw me standing there like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, call me over.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got these big, like eight foot cast
iron stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asked me how many I need gave me 12 of
these cast iron stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to stake up all my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no solution other than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A culture where it's so accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you go to a grow shop out there,
just a normal like, yeah, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like hardware garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: On one of the aisles, you'll see some
plant food, cheap, shitty plant food,
[SPEAKER_00]: but with cannabis leaves or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sensitizes these kinds of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they see me growing a few plants,
the lady, she's complimented me on my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants before she's like, Oh, your plants
are looking lovely this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I felt so awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Oh, I've got melons too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to show my other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, it's not just ginger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in California, we still don't even
have that kind of attitude here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like where neighbors are okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I have neighbors where I'm just like
every day I'm just waiting, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the universe was kind to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have been anywhere next to anyone
to land in between two neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that are just gardeners that just farm
their house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only come on weekdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put baskets of fruit on the fence,
like peaches off their trees, like we just
[SPEAKER_00]: share back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just give them what they give me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same from the other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, it's a beautiful place out
here and culture's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a cannabis social club seems
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's not quite lived up to some of
my expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of things that I don't like
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this same probably review,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way the scenes dictated these days
doesn't fire with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I'll say,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember the times when growers
decided what smoke has smoked on what we
[SPEAKER_00]: grew?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now not that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I get people that hit me up and they
want my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, sir, they want niche things from me,
but then they say to me, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: have you got something with any hype in
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've got to sell a couple of bits
and if you ain't got a name, that people
[SPEAKER_00]: know or something in here, I'm going to
struggle move in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, Oh, I could, I used to be
able to take someone something and I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't even need to give it a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could just be like, is this,
this, this, and this people just take my
[SPEAKER_00]: word because they knew that I'm growing
fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd get variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd like something more than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and that's how you found amazing
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the way things are marketed,
the things that are on the beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's so warped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a friend that grew a beautiful,
a pure Michigan, which is like a,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an Oreo Oreo something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyone that knows Oreos, I've,
I've had the Oreos cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've bred with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful cut, but bland most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even grown well, bland, but great
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great breeding, a lot of potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pure Michigan that you've done was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke wise leaps and bounds above the
Oreos.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what turned me onto what a good
breeding plant it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he takes some of the pure Michigan to a
club in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sits on the menu for weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They change it to Oreos and it's sold out
instantly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I don't know how to get my
head around that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the way things are sadly,
like some of the market and over here,
[SPEAKER_00]: people are so caught up in the Mylar bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the Mylar's aren't even real.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mylar, Mylar, Mylar over there from my
buddy in Austria.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's talking about how like the seed packs
over there have like Mylar's like this big
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's how big your Mylar is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's something to do with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that people are fed up with
feeling like criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the minute you get something in a
fancy bag that's branded and marketed,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all part of the feeling of feeling
normal, of feeling like a normal consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: buying a normal consumer product,
not feeling like a criminal buying a
[SPEAKER_00]: criminal, a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what people tap into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's where it comes from,
but we need to kind of breed some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: more like educated consumer going forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a good time to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have your podcast, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're trying to educate people.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're doing a great job over there,
you know, and in Europe, we have to have
[SPEAKER_04]: just as much education as we do over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was a big reason I wanted to
bring you on was so people that are in the
[SPEAKER_04]: US, Breed Your Syndicate that was in our
show can also tune into your show because
[SPEAKER_04]: you're just as educated as all of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been around the scene longer than
me and they can get great, great news and
[SPEAKER_04]: info from you over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to talk about your show some?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I really need to get back
into a lot more heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going through a few ups and
downs as you know what it's like in this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a stepping stone industry,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So time and time again, I give people
opportunities and people use me as a
[SPEAKER_00]: stepping stone to further themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been through that roller coaster
over the last year or so, and it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: left me pouring into other people's cup
and not into my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I have missed is the
podcast because like you say, it does give
[SPEAKER_00]: people that kind of outlet information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love getting people on and giving people
insight into the European scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finds out what kind of flavors people are
hunting here, what kind of genetics people
[SPEAKER_00]: are favoring, what old school stuff is
being found and coming out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: woodwork, what's being revived,
what people miss, trying to piece together
[SPEAKER_00]: some history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm slowly getting back into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started to write like a little list of
different people that I want to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: get on for episodes and start getting
things together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm definitely going to be doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's important to have the dudes that know
their shit doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, I think every chance you get to
do it, it's a plus to the whole community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think people being able to hear in
America about you is even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, honestly, the Breed a Syndicate,
I love it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for me to hear the stories and
all the different people talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: different things and the different
theories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's what I was saying about with
Stoney is like those are the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations that we have where you know
when you're theorizing and when you get
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb on talking about all the different,
I've crossed this and I've unlocked this
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm seeing pop up in this and all the
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I just love it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the history.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a genetic nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time we've talked, it's just been
dorking out about genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, dude, you know your people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter where you're at.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know your people across the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, dude, we could talk for ages about
all your stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think we're going to need to do
a second one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd really like to have you back on
too, to do like a round table with a few
[SPEAKER_04]: of us so we could just nerd out about the
forums and like all the crazy ass stories
[SPEAKER_04]: we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know you have millions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you're on ICMAG or Overgrow and all
that shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, we should.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do, we need to do like one where
we just talk about what I'm working with
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and we're talking about actually
my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we need to do that forum round
table.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hi and Lonesome on here so you can
talk about some res, dawg.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many little stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one of the ones, you know,
like when we talk about different cuts and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ones that always gets confusing
is the East Coast Salvador.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll give you a reason why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember a point when there was a,
I don't know if you remember, there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: big drama on ICMAG where it was like a
dude called Friendly Friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like how more suspicious a name have
you got to have?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, Friendly Friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Res for the East Coast Sour Diesel Club
and kind of like used it on a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: weird projects and caused a whole bunch of
drama.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was crazy, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like Res didn't like to give out no
cuts to no one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he done is he passed out the East
Coast Sour Diesel Club to Sun Simulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a BX2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the kind of shit that muddied
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because imagine everyone who knew,
Res said, yeah, I gave him the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he got the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: But secretly behind the scenes,
he told me, yeah, no, that was the BX2
[SPEAKER_00]: that you smoked last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't give him the real cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like that's how quickly everything
gets twisted and no one knows what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: real cut anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how greedy it is too,
because like he knows he's going to fuck
[SPEAKER_04]: up all kinds of people's provenance down
the road, what people think they have.
