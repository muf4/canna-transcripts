[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to start the day off with
Kathleen Martin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Kathleen Martin, as you all know,
is Denise of Greenville.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was the name of Barney Hill's,
our council, their abduction that kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: started the whole thing on that road.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, we've got our Roswell
people here, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, of course, Roswell started a big
thing, you know, in our beautiful
[SPEAKER_05]: community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, anyway, we've got a lot of great
guest speakers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to enjoy yourself,
and you're going to learn a lot,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyhow, I'm going to have to take up
your time, but I'll let me introduce you
[SPEAKER_05]: to Kathleen Martin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Kathleen.
Thank you, Mary.
Thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope everyone had a good night's sleep
after that terrific meal last night.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just need to put this back in the
beginning.
We've been testing the sound.
So, here we go again.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is captured from any Barney Hill UFO
experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: Many people have asked me why I decided to
research and investigate my aunt and
[SPEAKER_07]: uncle's UFO site.
[SPEAKER_07]: And why I decided to write a book about it
when other books have been written about
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Interrupted Journey, primarily,
but it had been mentioned in other books.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my reply to that is, in 1988,
I watched a television series called
[SPEAKER_07]: Cosmos.
[SPEAKER_07]: Carl Sagan was on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Carl presented the story of the UFO.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty and Barney Hill UFO experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it showed Betty and Barney riding down
the highway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very, very dark night.
[SPEAKER_07]: Torrential downpours.
[SPEAKER_07]: The windshield wipers were swishing back
and forth.
[SPEAKER_07]: The radio was on.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a lot of static.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Betty was turning the knob as she was
nervously looking up at the sky.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Barney was saying, don't worry,
Betty.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only a plane or a satellite or
something.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all of that was false.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I actually contacted Steve Markle,
who is the chief meteorologist at the
[SPEAKER_07]: Mount Washington Weather Station in New
Hampshire, and I asked him to look into
[SPEAKER_07]: his archival records, I wanted to know
exactly what the weather conditions were
that night.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I did all of the research.
[SPEAKER_07]: Myself, although other researchers had
done it, I didn't want to believe anything
[SPEAKER_07]: anyone said.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Steve Markle told me that it was a
light, bright night atop the rock.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is what he called Mount Washington.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the visibility was 130 miles.
[SPEAKER_07]: There were high, cirrus clouds covering
about 60% of the sky.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they were the type of clouds that you
could see.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you could see the stars through them.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a waxing gibbous moon.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be full in six days.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it was not raining.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was not an inversion, a temperature
inversion that night, that would make
[SPEAKER_07]: distant objects appear closer than they
were.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a great night for observing this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Betty told me that the radio was not
on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, all of that was false.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then, I knew it was March 4, 1993.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had already started investigating this.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Carl Sagan, again, published an
article in Parade Magazine.
[SPEAKER_07]: There it was read by thousands and
thousands of people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in that article, he wrote that Betty
and Barney were driving through the
[SPEAKER_07]: desolate area in White Mountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, two weeks later, she had a dream
about being abducted and convinced Barney
[SPEAKER_07]: that they had both been abducted.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was also a lie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Stan Friedman, who went to the
University of Chicago, who was a classmate
[SPEAKER_07]: of Carl Sagan, they were adversaries about
UFOs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Carl sent a review copy of this article to
Stan.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Stan wrote back, sales-based,
a 12-page letter pointing out all of the
[SPEAKER_07]: mistakes that Carl had made.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this was two months before the
article was published.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Carl changed only one thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was, he said that Betty and
Barney were a childless couple.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Barney had two sons by a previous
marriage.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Betty had adopted her first husband's
three children.
[SPEAKER_07]: He changed that.
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't change anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't change any of the rest of his
misinformation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And even though he was an astronomer,
he played amateur psychologist in this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you attended my lecture yesterday,
you learned about hypnagogic sleep states,
[SPEAKER_07]: hypnopomic sleep states, sleep paralysis,
and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Carl was completely wrong when he was
talking about the idea that this
[SPEAKER_07]: hallucination could actually explain UFO
abduction because we know that it's
[SPEAKER_07]: internally generated.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's absolutely no physical evidence in
a hallucination.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in a hallucination, it is very short.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have a complex narrative in a
hallucination.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a delusion.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let us begin.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to introduce you to my aunt and
uncle, Betty and Barney Hill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty was born on June 28, 1919.
[SPEAKER_07]: She was the oldest child of Florence and
Raymond Barrett.
[SPEAKER_07]: She grew up in South Kingston,
New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there were five children in the
family.
[SPEAKER_07]: My mother was Betty's younger sister.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty was a very bright child at a time
when very few people went on to college.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty did go to college.
[SPEAKER_07]: She graduated from college with a degree
in social work.
[SPEAKER_07]: She worked for the state of New Hampshire
as a social worker and a child welfare
[SPEAKER_07]: worker, and eventually was promoted to the
position of supervisor.
[SPEAKER_07]: She died in October of 2004 from lung
cancer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the third cancer, independent
cancer, not related, that she died.
[SPEAKER_07]: She had started in the 1990s.
[SPEAKER_07]: The last one did metastasize.
[SPEAKER_07]: The others did not.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney was the youngest in his family.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was born on July 20, 1922.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was born in Newport News, Virginia and
grew up in Virginia and on the family farm
[SPEAKER_07]: and also in Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_07]: He became very discouraged in high school.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had an IQ of 140, a very bright
student.
[SPEAKER_07]: He wanted to become a civil engineer.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was advised that because he was African
American, there was no work for him in
[SPEAKER_07]: that field.
[SPEAKER_07]: He would never be hired.
[SPEAKER_07]: He became discouraged.
[SPEAKER_07]: He dropped out of high school and went
into the army just before the outbreak of
[SPEAKER_07]: World War II.
[SPEAKER_07]: He later went back and did earn his high
school diploma.
[SPEAKER_07]: During World War II, he served honorably.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a truck driver and a marksman.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was wounded during the war,
discharged in fair condition, and his
[SPEAKER_07]: military records state that he was an
excellent character.
[SPEAKER_07]: He worked for the post office,
married and had two children.
[SPEAKER_07]: He and his first wife divorced.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were both activists in the civil
rights movement.
[SPEAKER_07]: Although they never intended to fall in
love and get married, it was pretty
[SPEAKER_07]: difficult during that time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Certainly in the state of Virginia where
he grew up, there were anti-miscegenation
[SPEAKER_07]: laws.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was against the law for them to even
enter that state as a married couple,
[SPEAKER_07]: along with 17 other states.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they were married and they had a very
good marriage.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the dog, Dalcy, who is long on the
trip.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dalcy also experienced some physical,
physiological problems after the encounter
[SPEAKER_07]: with the UFO.
[SPEAKER_07]: She developed a fungus infection and she
had what seemed to be nightmares.
[SPEAKER_07]: These were new.
[SPEAKER_07]: She would woof while she was sleeping and
her little legs would run.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty said that this was not
characteristic behavior.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Betty and Barney left for Niagara
Falls on September 17, 1961.
[SPEAKER_07]: They hadn't had a great honeymoon.
[SPEAKER_07]: They got married in New Jersey and then
traveled to Betty's home in Coorsburg,
[SPEAKER_07]: New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney wanted to surprise Betty.
[SPEAKER_07]: She had a week's vacation from the welfare
department and he asked for a few days off
[SPEAKER_07]: from his job in the post office.
[SPEAKER_07]: And surprised her with this trip.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that they probably went because I
had gone to Niagara Falls about a month
[SPEAKER_07]: before that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I enjoyed it so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was showing Betty and Barney my
photographs and talking about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty had never been to Niagara Falls.
So I think that's what gave Barney the
idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also like to show this photograph of
myself because the debunkers all say that
[SPEAKER_07]: I was only three years old when all of
this happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can possibly remember what I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can obviously see that I was not
three, I was 13.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is the route that Betty and
Barney took on their trip.
[SPEAKER_07]: They first went to Niagara Falls.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then they drove up, spent the night in the
Thousand Islands area and went on to
[SPEAKER_07]: Montreal the next day on the 19th.
[SPEAKER_07]: They thought it's been the night in
Montreal, but the road signs were in
[SPEAKER_07]: French.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone was speaking French when Barney
went to ask for directions when he was
[SPEAKER_07]: lost.
[SPEAKER_07]: They showed him the men's room.
So he didn't have a good map of the city.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he decided to just drive to the
outskirts and drive on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they grew tired, that they would
stop on their way home.
[SPEAKER_07]: Somewhere along the line, they did hear
that there was a hurricane coming up the
[SPEAKER_07]: coast and thought it would be a good idea
if they did travel to Portsmouth that
[SPEAKER_07]: night.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, and Barney was accustomed to staying
up all night long.
[SPEAKER_07]: He worked graveyard shifts at the post
office.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the road that they took.
[SPEAKER_07]: They took from Montreal down to New
Hampshire, northern New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_07]: They went from Montreal to Coat Cook.
[SPEAKER_07]: On Route 112 and then from Coat Cook,
they took 141 down to Route 3 to Colborne,
[SPEAKER_07]: New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Coat Cook.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you read or have heard anything that
the bumpers will tell you, they have said
[SPEAKER_07]: that Barney was so upset because he was
confronted by hoodlums when he was in
Canada.
And that they harassed him because he was
a big white woman.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that this caused him so much emotional
distress that when he was looking up at
[SPEAKER_07]: that alleged UFO that was actually a
conventional aircraft, he hallucinated
[SPEAKER_07]: hoodlums looking back down at him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, all of that, of course, is false as
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty and Barney did go into a restaurant
in Coat Cook.
[SPEAKER_07]: He did see young men in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: There were two young men who had what he
called duckbill haircuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: He associated that with hoodlums and went
on guard momentarily.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then he discovered that they were very
nice young men.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were dressed in conventional
clothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: They ate.
[SPEAKER_07]: They used the rest of their Canadian
money.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they moved on and had a very pleasant
time at that restaurant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney was a little upset with himself
because he realized that he had
[SPEAKER_07]: stereotyped them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he really had a problem with people
stereotyping him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they were driving home along the
way.
[SPEAKER_07]: They traveled over a gravel road.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a very nice gravel road between
Coat Cook and Northern New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dr. Simon asked Barney what kind of
mood he was in.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was looking for somebody to stress.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to play for you now the first
recording of Barney's answer to Dr. Simon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you able to hear that?
It's not really clear.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the original hypnosis tapes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did have them put onto a CD.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they were not clear to begin with.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Barney was stating that he was in good
spirits.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was in high spirits.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had a delightful day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he felt he could drive on down to New
Hampshire without a problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they passed through U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: Customs in Canaan, Vermont.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the route they took through
the northern and central part of New
[SPEAKER_07]: Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we have Colbrook.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's Lancaster and his Twin Mountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: In Colbrook, they stopped for another
step.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was going to be their last
opportunity to have a cup of coffee before
[SPEAKER_07]: they traveled on to New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were about two to three hours,
actually it was about three hours away
[SPEAKER_07]: from their home in Portsmouth.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've driven this route over and over
again, measuring distance and time,
[SPEAKER_07]: driving at the rate of speed that Barney
reported that he was driving, and stopping
[SPEAKER_07]: at the stops that he reported he stopped
at.
[SPEAKER_07]: In order to attempt to become lost,
or in order to attempt to have this in
[SPEAKER_07]: time, and I couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they stopped at Howard's Restaurant,
had a snack.
[SPEAKER_07]: They left the restaurant at 10 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_07]: They checked their watches, and then went
on to Lancaster.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're driving along, and just south
of Lancaster, it was about 10.50 when they
[SPEAKER_07]: arrived there, so it was a little later
than that, Betty noticed a new light in
[SPEAKER_07]: the sky.
[SPEAKER_07]: A month later, she reported this to Walter
Webb from NICAP.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I told you about Walter Webb
yesterday, about his background.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was an astronomer.
[SPEAKER_07]: He worked at the Hayden Planetarium in
Boston.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he interviewed Betty and Barney,
separate and together, for six hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what they told him is that Betty's
eyes were drawn to this new light in the
[SPEAKER_07]: sky.
[SPEAKER_07]: The couple initially thought they were
observing the falling star, only it moved
[SPEAKER_07]: upward, a plane or a satellite.
[SPEAKER_07]: So though that is a quote of what Walter
wrote in his original confidential report.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Betty continued to watch this as
Barney drove along, watching the road.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was coming closer and closer,
and it really spurred her interest.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she told Barney she wanted to stop so
that she could get a better look at this
[SPEAKER_07]: through binoculars.
[SPEAKER_07]: He really didn't want to.
[SPEAKER_07]: He wanted to drive on.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a confirmed skeptic.
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't believe that UFOs were real.
[SPEAKER_07]: But she told him that Delce was restless,
and Delce needed to go for a walk.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he did stop.
[SPEAKER_07]: He found a roadside stop at Mount
Cleveland picnic area, south of Twin
[SPEAKER_07]: Mountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was about 11.20 when they arrived
there, by my calculation, and they got out
[SPEAKER_07]: of the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to play for you what Betty
saw.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw it travel across the whole face of
the moon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was odd shaped.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was flashing all different colored
lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, to bunker, Robert Shaker will tell
you that this was the planet Jupiter that
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty saw.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Betty wrote to him and said,
you know, how could the planet Jupiter
[SPEAKER_07]: pass in front of the face of the moon,
flashing multicolored lights?
[SPEAKER_07]: And he replied in a very, very nasty
letter.
[SPEAKER_07]: He kind of a nasty guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: To two bed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And continues to tell the same story after
all of these years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Barney got out of the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had walked Delce.
[SPEAKER_07]: He went to the trunk of the car and
removed a pistol.
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason he did that is because they
were in picnic area.
[SPEAKER_07]: There were bears in the area.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was afraid that the bears would
come out of the woods.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was a city person.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was afraid of bears.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he took the gun out for protection
against the bears initially.
[SPEAKER_07]: What he did is he took the binoculars from
Betty and watched this craft as it
[SPEAKER_07]: traveled toward Vermont in a northwest
direction.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then without turning, it suddenly shot
back at him so rapidly that he could see
[SPEAKER_07]: the windows in it at that point.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was unconventional.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was silent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it did not have conventional lighting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next, they entered Franconia Notch.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was four miles south of the Mount
Cleveland picnic area.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Franconia Notch in the fall.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a beautiful tourist area.
[SPEAKER_07]: As they passed by Cannon Mountain,
Betty noticed the tower on top of Cannon
[SPEAKER_07]: Mountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: The craft passed over the top of the
tower.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the steady light on the tower blinked
out as the craft passed over it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They decided to stop again.
[SPEAKER_07]: They stopped by the Old Man of the
Mountain, which is on the back side of
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannon Mountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: This face fell.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a stone granite profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: It fell in May of 2003.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was our state symbol, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_07]: We no longer have it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the important part here is that
between the Old Man's forehead and chin
[SPEAKER_07]: was 48 feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is important because Betty said
that the craft came around and stopped by
[SPEAKER_07]: the Old Man's profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was at least one and a half times
the length of the Old Man's profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had stopped.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd gotten out of the vehicle.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you're seeing here is a profile lake.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just underneath the Old Man's
profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually he fell into part of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: He fell into the lake in 2003.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to play for you now Barney's
description of what he saw when he got out
of the car on the second stop.
No, it is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was too fast.
It pulled too fast.
It could come back so fast.
It could go all the way and come back.
And without looking as if it turned,
it would come straight back.
It would go like a
[SPEAKER_02]: ball in the rubber.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they returned to the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney was driving very slowly at this
point, to crank only a notch.
[SPEAKER_07]: While Betty was watching the craft as it
traveled along the top of the mountains,
[SPEAKER_07]: sometimes coming down in front of the
mountains, sometimes behind the mountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was traveling sometimes in a spare step
pattern.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she was very intrigued by what she was
seeing.
[SPEAKER_07]: They came out of crank only a notch at
Indian Head.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Indian Head.
[SPEAKER_07]: And right across the street from Indian
Head are some cabins.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Indian Head Resort is there now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a beautiful resort.
[SPEAKER_07]: I highly recommend that you go there and
stay there if you go to New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are currently erecting a monument to
Betty and Barney Hill.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they will have a travel guide so that
you can actually, if you stay there,
[SPEAKER_07]: get their travel guide and follow this
route yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm pretty excited about the fact that
there will be a monument for Betty and
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But getting back to what happened next,
Barney stated to Dr. Simon when he saw
[SPEAKER_07]: these cabins that he felt safe and less of
a barren hostility of the wooded area.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said, I've been there before and I feel
confident that I see a familiar place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty was becoming excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Barney said, Betty rarely became
excited over anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he thought maybe he could find a place
where he could pull over again.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's driving around and looking.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he saw a natureland.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a little tourist area.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he couldn't pull over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as he was driving along, he was forced
to stop.
[SPEAKER_07]: The craft had shifted ahead and stopped
just to the right of US Highway Route 3.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the off season.
[SPEAKER_07]: There were not other vehicles on the road
then.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go there now, it's pretty heavily
populated.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very different.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll see cars.
[SPEAKER_07]: But at that time of night, on that night,
Betty and Barney did not see another
[SPEAKER_07]: vehicle.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a good thing because Barney
stopped that car right in the middle of
[SPEAKER_07]: the highway, straddling the center strip,
the center line, and got out to look at
[SPEAKER_07]: this craft while Betty sat in the car
watching it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he said, it continued to have a
forward look, facing me as if it swung and
[SPEAKER_07]: did not move.
[SPEAKER_07]: It continued to move from its position,
but just swung from position with the
[SPEAKER_07]: front still facing me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it moved to my left.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I continued to look.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I began walking across the highway.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what he told Walter Webb in the
confidential report in October of 1961.
[SPEAKER_07]: He also told Walter, the figures were
dressed in shiny black uniforms and black
[SPEAKER_07]: hats with bills.
[SPEAKER_07]: They reminded Barney of the cold precision
of German officers.
[SPEAKER_07]: The leader of the windmill held a special
attraction for Barney.
[SPEAKER_07]: He could almost feel the leader's intense
concentration to carry out a plan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney was questioned about this event
several times by Dr. Simon.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I'm going to play for you now is
the tape of Barney's first hypnotic
[SPEAKER_07]: regression with Dr. Simon so that you can
actually hear the intensity of emotion in
[SPEAKER_07]: his voice as he relived this experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the point where he experienced
just after this a mental block.
Stay there.
And keep looking.
Just keep looking and stay there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just keep looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just keep looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you hear him tell you this?
Could you hear him tell you this?
Oh, no.
He didn't say it.
Did he tell you he said it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he didn't say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to be sure he was telling
you this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calm down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to be sure he was telling
you this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, the devil in his eyes is beautiful,
huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: But you sent him on my way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You sent him on my way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said to him, you are looking over his
shoulder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everybody moved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone was standing there, looking at
me.
But everybody moved.
[SPEAKER_02]: To these leaders, or in the back,
or they went to this big, the poor,
[SPEAKER_02]: they look like, in the back of order.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all they just wanted was a black,
black, shiny jacket.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see, you can hear the intensity of
emotion in Barney's response to what he
[SPEAKER_07]: saw on board that craft.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had a conscious recollection of
encountering a non-human being.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he, in his original report,
in October, of 1961, described what he saw
[SPEAKER_07]: to Walter Webb.
[SPEAKER_07]: He simply could not remember their facial
features at that point.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was something about him that
terrified him and caused him to have a
[SPEAKER_07]: mental block.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I'm going to play the same kind of
rendition, but this is a later hypnotic
[SPEAKER_07]: regression.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Barney has calmed down.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's undergone his ab reaction and
catharsis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now he is more rational about his
experience.
I noticed with my binoculars that there
were about 11 men now, I thought,
looking down at me.
And they suddenly made a turn to what I
thought was a panel.
And I could see their arms going up.
And there was one that kept looking down.
And I kept going closer.
And I could see two red lights coming out
from the tip of this thing that did not
look like a plane at all, or a helicopter.
And I could see a long something coming
down from the center.
And I kept going closer and closer.
And I thought, oh my god, what is this
thing?
And I felt something.
I felt myself being told to come closer.
And I was greatly confused.
And I closed my eyes.
And I thought, this can't be real.
And I shook my head and turned it away and
looked back.
And I thought, oh god, it's there.
What is this thing?
And I put my hand to my gun.
And I could not put my hand there.
And I could not understand why my hands
kept going up with the binoculars.
And I was told to keep the binoculars up
and keep looking up and keep coming
closer.
No horror would come to me.
And that's when I opened my hands and the
binoculars fell around my neck.
And I ran screaming back to the car that
they were going to capture us.
And yet I could not understand what they
wanted to capture us for.
And I thought, I should report this to the
police if ever I could find a car box
or something.
And I thought, since they had all the
blackjack, the one looking at me had a
blackjacket, he must have been a military
officer.
And yet I could not quite understand why
they were doing what they were doing.
And there was no sound coming from this
thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney did run back to the vehicle
thinking that he was in danger or being
[SPEAKER_07]: captured.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he stated that as he entered his car,
the craft moved overhead.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when it did, he started speeding down
the highway.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to play for you now what
Betty described.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because as that craft hovered over their
vehicle, they had heard a series of
[SPEAKER_07]: beeping, what Betty called beeping sounds,
code-like mechanical beeping sounds,
[SPEAKER_07]: what Barney called buzzing sounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's different words to describe the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just beep, beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, I can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that noise?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that, oh, I can think of it's some
kind of electrical signal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody's, you know, beep, beep,
beep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought, well, I wonder,
oh, don't, why didn't I learn the math
[SPEAKER_03]: code?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because maybe this is the math code and I
don't know it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought, well, maybe it's
electrical.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I put my hand up in the middle of the
car and I kept feeling and feeling and I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't feel any shock, electric shock.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the whole car was vibrating.
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole car was vibrating and that
vibration caused a tingling sensation to
[SPEAKER_07]: Pastor Betty's and Barney's bodies.
[SPEAKER_07]: When that happened, they stopped speaking
to each other and they didn't speak again
[SPEAKER_07]: until they were 35 miles down the highway.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it seemed that only an instant had
passed.
[SPEAKER_07]: As I listened to their separate hypnosis
tapes, they suddenly find themselves on a
[SPEAKER_07]: new road that they haven't been on before.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are tall trees all around.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty attempted to find a rational
explanation and just thought that they
[SPEAKER_07]: must have been continuing to drive down US
Highway Route 3 and then made a left-hand
[SPEAKER_07]: turn onto Route 175, which runs parallel
to Route 3.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's no evidence of that on the
hypnosis tapes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So somehow they got from Route 3 over to
Route 175 to a new area.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a long pause after these beeping
and buzzing sounds and suddenly,
they're in a new location.
Perhaps that craft picked their car up.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have been known to pick up other
cars.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's take a look at their timeline.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the first stop at 1050 south of
Twin Mountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the old man of the mountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: The second stop at about 1150.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, Betty said that as they passed
Cannon Mountain, she glanced at her watch
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was 1120.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I might have been a little too liberal,
but I wanted to make sure that I added
[SPEAKER_07]: time to this to try to find a rational or
a mundane explanation for what happened to
[SPEAKER_07]: them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I may be off there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the encounter field, the third
stop.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was about 1215 by my calculation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And down here is the capture site.
[SPEAKER_07]: The hills remembered a roadblock and they
remembered men in the road.
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't know when or where it
occurred.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is part of their conscious
recollection.
[SPEAKER_07]: They remembered a fiery orb.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to play for you now what
Barney told Dr. Simon about that fiery
[SPEAKER_07]: orb.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can the moon be on the highway in that
kind of position?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could never seem to find any terrain
up there that would fit what I generally
[SPEAKER_03]: remember that they were sitting there
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't remember any men riding it
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I sort of don't remember.
And now I remember.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, this was after the hypnosis.
[SPEAKER_07]: He always had these shadowing memories of
a roadblock.
[SPEAKER_07]: He and Betty consciously recalled this
fiery orb.
[SPEAKER_07]: They attempted to rationalize that perhaps
it was the moon setting, but it didn't fit
[SPEAKER_07]: the characteristics of a setting moon.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Barney realized that this object was
moving, but he was not moving.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and they drove on.
[SPEAKER_07]: They passed through one of the new
Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they heard their second series of
code-like beeping or buzzing sounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: This brought them back to full
consciousness.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is when Barney stopped the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: He shifted from side to side on the road.
[SPEAKER_07]: He attempted to create this type of sound
and wasn't able to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty said to him, well, now he believed
in flying saucers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he said, don't be ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no such thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they drove down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's Plymouth, Ashland.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is actually a 1960 roadmap of New
Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_07]: In Northfield, they recalled seeing a sign
that said 17 miles to Concord.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's Concord, the state capital.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they made a beeline over here to
Portsmouth, New Hampshire, thinking that
[SPEAKER_07]: they would arrive at 3 a.m.
[SPEAKER_07]: at the latest.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was 5.15.
[SPEAKER_07]: They checked their watches and their
watches had both stopped.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Barney went into the kitchen and
checked the clock.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Betty walked Delcey the dog.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney felt a strange sensation in his
groin.
[SPEAKER_07]: He checked his groin, went into the
bathroom, didn't see anything then.
[SPEAKER_07]: But a couple of months later, 21 3-4 inch
growths had grown in a concentric circle
[SPEAKER_07]: on his groin.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were later removed.
[SPEAKER_07]: They became inflamed while he was
undergoing hypnosis with Dr. Son.
[SPEAKER_07]: The lab report confirmed that they were
not venereal warts.
[SPEAKER_07]: He and Betty felt glad as if they'd been
contaminated.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they really did worry about
contamination.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the watches that had stopped never
worked again.
[SPEAKER_07]: And his binocular strap was broken.
[SPEAKER_07]: The tops of his shoes were scraped,
not just scuffed, but scraped.
And he was a meticulous dresser.
[SPEAKER_07]: After that, he had to wear these shoes for
yard work.
[SPEAKER_07]: They sat down in separate rooms and Betty
sketched the practice.
[SPEAKER_07]: She recalled seeing it seated from her
position in the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is Barney's sketch.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had seen it from next to the car and
also from the field.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so he said this is how it looked when
it was about 200 feet high.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was when it was beside the highway on
the right side or the west side of their
[SPEAKER_07]: vehicle.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it descended to within about 100
feet of their vehicle.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was a little red light on each
side there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is how it looked when it was when
it shifted over the highway, descending to
[SPEAKER_07]: about 100 feet over the field.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these little thin-like structures
appeared to come out with a red light on
[SPEAKER_07]: each end.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can see the little figures that he
drew the day he arrived home.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if anyone tells you that all of this
was recovered under hypnosis, you have
[SPEAKER_07]: proof now that they have full conscious
recollection of everything except for the
[SPEAKER_07]: abduction itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Betty took off her dress.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when she did, she noticed that the
zipper was torn at the top.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was an inch, one and a half inch
tear on one side, an inch tear on the
[SPEAKER_07]: other side.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a tear in the thick zipper
fabric and in the stitching.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was a new dress.
[SPEAKER_07]: How did this happen to a woman riding as a
passenger in a vehicle down the highway?
[SPEAKER_07]: The lining was torn from waist to hemline.
[SPEAKER_07]: The hem was torn down on one side of her
dress.
[SPEAKER_07]: She folded it and placed it in her closet
knowing that she'd have to repair it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the next time she took it out,
there was a pink powdery substance on that
[SPEAKER_07]: dress.
[SPEAKER_07]: She hung it out on the clothesline.
[SPEAKER_07]: The pink powder blew away, but she noticed
that the dress was permanently stained.
[SPEAKER_07]: She decided to throw it away.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then on second thought, she thought
that it might hold a clue to what happened
[SPEAKER_07]: to her on that night.
[SPEAKER_07]: So she saved that dress.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it has undergone laboratory analysis
five separate times.
[SPEAKER_07]: No one has ever been able to identify what
that pink powdery substance is.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking for a PhD botanist who might
be able to look at it to see if it's some
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of mumbo-jumbo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fungus or mold.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you go online to the Black Vault
Encyclopedia, Phyllis Buddinger's report
[SPEAKER_07]: is on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's at UTO 25.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to point out, you can see
here the blue, this is the blue color of
[SPEAKER_07]: the dress.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see the discoloration.
[SPEAKER_07]: And something that Betty told Phyllis,
that told me as well, is that the areas
[SPEAKER_07]: where they actually touched her are the
areas that were most saturated by that
[SPEAKER_07]: pink powdery substance.
[SPEAKER_07]: They grabbed her with their very long,
narrow hands around her armpits.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see on the hem where it dropped
onto the floor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also this discoloration up in that
zipper area.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Phyllis Buddinger.
[SPEAKER_07]: She has a master's degree in chemistry.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's a research scientist.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's retired now.
[SPEAKER_07]: She works as a consultant sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she has her own laboratory.
[SPEAKER_07]: She worked for BP Anaco, which was
formerly Standard Oil for 35 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's specialized in petroleum,
chemical, and polymer analysis using
[SPEAKER_07]: spectroscopic techniques.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have such a high degree of respect
for her.
[SPEAKER_07]: She did the most thorough chemical
analysis of anybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: I write about it in the book, or you can
go online for the full 47 page report that
[SPEAKER_07]: she wrote.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was an oil type substance on the
exterior of that dress that did not belong
[SPEAKER_07]: to Betty.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was external and probably deposited
there by something else.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Phyllis ended up, this is, and I'm going
to phone her, she wrote this to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Her conclusion was, I am convinced that
the event did happen as determined by the
[SPEAKER_07]: chemical analysis I did on Betty Mill's
dress.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Betty then phoned my mother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney said that they should never tell
anybody about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: No good could possibly come of telling
anyone about this event.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Betty then went to the telephone and
immediately called my mother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Her sister.
[SPEAKER_07]: And talked to her.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Betty was so concerned that they
might be contaminated.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we had a neighbor who was a physicist.
[SPEAKER_07]: My mother called her neighbor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he suggested, for some reason,
and I'll never understand this,
[SPEAKER_07]: but he suggested that Betty take a
compass, if she had one, and go out to the
[SPEAKER_07]: car and see how the needle on the compass
would react.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we know it's going to fluctuate when
you put it over the engine, when you put
[SPEAKER_07]: it over the battery.
[SPEAKER_07]: But she started, I'm going to let her tell
you, postmortem, what she did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was like a lacquer put on over the
car.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even when I went,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it had been raining that day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the car was all wet, still wet.
And
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't see what was happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kept going closer and closer to the
trunk.
And then it was, when I started to go to
the trunk of the car, because I noticed
[SPEAKER_03]: the shiny spots on the trunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: That they were these very, very shiny
spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that the whole cluster of them,
about the size of, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_03]: half dollars, or several dollars,
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it must have been, oh, 12 or 18.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was about 12 or 18, I would say,
all around this spot, and very shiny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I just kept the compass anywhere
near them, the compass kept spinning
[SPEAKER_03]: around and around and around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at this I panicked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got more
of...
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the debunkers will tell you that
Barney went out and experimented with the
[SPEAKER_07]: compass.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the compass behaved normally.
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't spin.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Betty was making all of this up.
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's hear from Barney what happened.
And I said, how can you not know if it
isn't anything?
And then I put the compass close to it.
And the compass would spin and spin.
And I would move the compass a few inches
to a spot that did not connect to a
parking on the trunk that did not have a
spot.
And the compass would drop down.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can see again the debunkers
aligning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the spots were in the exact location
where the hills said they heard the
[SPEAKER_07]: beeping or buzzing sounds that caused
their vehicle to vibrate and their bodies
[SPEAKER_07]: to tingle.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually saw these spots, as did the
other members of my family.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were at Betty's house within a day or
two of the time this occurred.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty washed and waxed her vehicle that
fall, but the spots would not rub out.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they faded away over the winter of
1961 and 1962.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in my book capture, I do have included
a letter that Betty wrote to Walter Webb
[SPEAKER_07]: about a meeting that she had with several
Air Force officers about those spots.
[SPEAKER_07]: And their opinions on what they might be.
[SPEAKER_07]: A number of people have speculated that
they might be just weather spots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Weather spots are caused when it rains and
pollutants drop down from the
[SPEAKER_07]: environmental pollutants drop down and
deposit on the trunk of the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the sun comes out and makes those
environmental pollutants on.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to actually buy a chemical
compound and rub those out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't get them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that is not what was on Betty and
Barney's car.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not what they looked like.
[SPEAKER_07]: It had been raining, but the sun didn't
come out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was continuing to rain that afternoon,
that evening.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they had not been there the day
before.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what they looked like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Betty was excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: She called my mother back.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the chief of police of Newton,
who was actually the former chief of
[SPEAKER_07]: police at that point, he had resigned
shortly before that.
But he was my father's best friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he came to the house every night and
had a cup of coffee on his way home from
[SPEAKER_07]: work.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he told Betty that she should report
this to the Air Force that the police
[SPEAKER_07]: departments had all received instructions
from Pease Air Force Base for people to
[SPEAKER_07]: call them to report their UFO science.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what she and Barney did.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can see the original report.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in the appendix of my book.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the original handwritten report
right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And already there's a cover up going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: It says that there was a strong inversion
in the Lincoln, New Hampshire area.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we already know, from what I've told
you from the chief meteorologist from
[SPEAKER_07]: Mount Washington Weather Station,
that there was not a strong inversion that
[SPEAKER_07]: night when they passed through.
[SPEAKER_07]: The inversion set up in some of the lower
valleys the following morning after they
[SPEAKER_07]: had already arrived home.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the original report up here,
you'll see that it's hand checked that it
[SPEAKER_07]: was picked up on air intercept radar at
ground level.
[SPEAKER_07]: On visual radar.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the radar report.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every other report after this does not
have air intercept radar checked off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. James McDonald said that he had
actually seen the pilot's report.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what he told Betty.
[SPEAKER_07]: That disappeared from the files.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has never been seen again.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just the second page.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are several pages of the air
intelligence report.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only a description of what you have
already seen on the slides.
[SPEAKER_07]: Approximately 10 days after this
experience, Betty had five disturbing
[SPEAKER_07]: nightmares or dreams.
[SPEAKER_07]: They occurred early in the morning just
before she woke up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney was not sleeping with her because
he was working nights.
[SPEAKER_07]: At the post office.
[SPEAKER_07]: They included her conscious memories of
UFO sighting.
[SPEAKER_07]: But sandwiched in between these events was
a UFO abduction in these dreams.
[SPEAKER_07]: She rearranged.
[SPEAKER_07]: She wrote them down.
[SPEAKER_07]: She rearranged them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in November of 1961, she wrote a five
page paper about what she had dreamed.
[SPEAKER_07]: This has always created a lot of
controversy because Dr. Simon for one,
[SPEAKER_07]: and this is Dr. Simon, hypothesized that
perhaps Betty had only repeated her dreams
[SPEAKER_07]: under hypnosis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that Barney had created a fantasy and
confabulated the information under
[SPEAKER_07]: hypnosis about an abduction.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was really startled at how similar
Betty's and Barney's stories were.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just couldn't believe that they were so
similar.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that had to come from something that
was in place because of course,
[SPEAKER_07]: UFOs were not real and no one had ever
been abducted.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he was looking for another explanation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I told you yesterday about Dr. Simon's
credentials.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was very outstanding psychiatrist,
neurologist.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had set up the psychiatric unit at the
Mason General Hospital on Long Island in
[SPEAKER_07]: New York.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a 3,000 bed unit.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was the chief of psychiatry there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Had a tremendous amount of success in
treating post traumatic stress disorder.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a lieutenant colonel in the army.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was awarded the army commendation
medal, the American campaign medal,
[SPEAKER_07]: the victory medal.
[SPEAKER_07]: He taught at Yale and he lectured at
Harvard.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was skilled in deep trans hypnosis
to resolve traumatic amnesia.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney was referred to him because he was
not able to resolve some physiological
[SPEAKER_07]: problems he was experiencing.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was hospitalized with bleeding ulcers.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was experiencing stress and he was not
responding to traditional medical
[SPEAKER_07]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he was referred to another
psychiatrist, Dr. Duncan Stevens.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one day when he was in Dr. Stevens'
office, he mentioned that he and Betty had
[SPEAKER_07]: traveled to the White Mountains the
previous weekend to try to jog their
[SPEAKER_07]: memories about this UFO experience that
they had and the missing time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dr. Stevens thought that Barney was
very well adjusted.
[SPEAKER_07]: He couldn't understand why he was
experiencing these problems because there
[SPEAKER_07]: was nothing else in his life that should
have caused that.
[SPEAKER_07]: He did miss his sons who were in
Philadelphia, but he saw them during
[SPEAKER_07]: vacations.
[SPEAKER_07]: He thought it was something more bothering
Barney.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he made the referral to Dr. Simon.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Betty went with him.
[SPEAKER_07]: They met with Dr. Simon for the first time
on December.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was December 14th, I believe,
1963.
[SPEAKER_07]: They started hypnosis in January.
[SPEAKER_07]: They underwent a period of conditioning.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on February 22nd, 1964,
Barney underwent his first hypnotic
regression session.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what he said and what Betty said as
well, and I did a comparative analysis in
[SPEAKER_07]: 1996.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty turned all the hypnosis tapes over
to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I transcribed all of them for comparative
analysis.
[SPEAKER_07]: My background is in social science and I
am now a hypnotherapist.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was not them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a social worker.
[SPEAKER_07]: I majored in psychiatric social work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is what they called it back then in
college.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I did this comparative analysis and
I told you, Betty and Barney suddenly
[SPEAKER_07]: found themselves on a new road and there
were tall trees all around.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Barney said, I kept driving and
driving and I made a turn and I never knew
[SPEAKER_07]: this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why I had to make that turn.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's when he saw that fiery orb in
the road.
[SPEAKER_07]: They then saw figures in the road.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to play for you Betty's
description of what she saw.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I thought, well, you know,
is there a car in the trap over there?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we doing there?
[SPEAKER_03]: And Barney said to stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he stopped the car and they came
up to the car.
They separated.
[SPEAKER_03]: They came up to two groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they started to do that,
I said, we're scared.
[SPEAKER_03]: The camera would die.
[SPEAKER_03]: The car would go off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they started coming up,
Barney tried to stop the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: He tried to stop it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know how a motor car would just
turn over and turn over on one side?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the car would stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they really cut each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they killed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'd get away for a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kept the car going up like it was on
the window side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was thinking, I'll just put my head
on the car and I'll pull up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it would make a noise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they opened it for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they opened the car door.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it just went like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I saw a cluster of six men
because three came to me and three did
not.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said he did not think of the men in the
sky at that time.
[SPEAKER_07]: He did think about going for his gun.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can see, Barney said that three
men went to his door.
[SPEAKER_07]: He saw a cluster of six men.
[SPEAKER_07]: Three went to bed.
[SPEAKER_07]: They went to Betty's door.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not in that dream material.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where did that come from?
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless it happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then they were taken out of the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney stated under hypnosis that he could
feel the tops of his feet bumping against
[SPEAKER_07]: the stones.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty stated not under hypnosis,
but you don't report everything that
[SPEAKER_07]: happens when you're hypnotized.
[SPEAKER_07]: You remember your experiences.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you don't report every single little
detail.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty remembered struggling with her
captors as they attempted to take her onto
[SPEAKER_07]: the craft.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she said that this is the point where
she tore the hem on her dress and the
[SPEAKER_07]: lining because she was fighting for her
life.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she kicked one of these guys as hard
as she could.
[SPEAKER_07]: But at that point, they took control of
her.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, and she lost consciousness.
[SPEAKER_07]: They took her into the craft.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is Barney's diagram of the
interior of the craft.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the ramp.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the side with the windows.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was a darkened hallway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney was taken into this room.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a table and there was a cabinet
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty was taken into this room.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a table, a chair, and a cabinet
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is Barney's diagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this is my composite of the aliens
that Betty described in her dreams.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to make that clear.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is her dream alien.
[SPEAKER_07]: They looked pretty human.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe Southern European.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dark hair, big hair, dark eyebrows,
blue lips.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they had lips.
[SPEAKER_07]: They looked a lot like Jimmy Durante.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had large, long, long noses.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were dressed in cadet-type uniforms.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were about five feet to five to
four inches tall.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were very human in appearance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's compare that to what Betty and
Barney described after hypnosis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very different.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the leader.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had a large chest cavity and spindly
legs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before they ever underwent hypnosis,
Barney recalled the roadblock.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he mentioned their spindly legs and
how they were oddly jointed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how, as they approached the car,
they were sort of shifting side to side.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very different from a human gaze.
[SPEAKER_07]: They described a membrane inside the mouth
that flooded when they spoke to each other
[SPEAKER_07]: in their own kind of sort of mumbling or
humming type of language.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty told me once that it reminded her of
the low groan of a beehive or a hornet's
[SPEAKER_07]: nest.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had enlarged, slanted eyes that they
said had square corners.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a vertical, cat-like pupil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the artist who actually drew this drew
it more human-looking than Betty said they
[SPEAKER_07]: actually were.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Betty and Barney described an iris
that filled up most of the white area of
[SPEAKER_07]: the eye.
[SPEAKER_07]: Only a very tiny bit of white was showing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was yellowish in color.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this painting is not completely
accurate.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one, the leader was about five feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty understood him in English,
although she did not see his mouth move.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney also understood him in English,
although he did not see his mouth move.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is not in Betty's dreams or recall.
This is the examiner.
[SPEAKER_07]: The original examiner painting was stolen
from Betty's house.
[SPEAKER_07]: I commissioned Patrick Richard from New
Mexico to do this painting of the
[SPEAKER_07]: examiner.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the examiner had a weaker chin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty thought perhaps this was female,
but didn't know for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was about four and a half feet tall.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very much like the leader.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had these long, narrow palms of their
hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they had probably three long fingers
and one that was shorter, from what Betty
[SPEAKER_07]: could recall.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a side view drawn by the original
artist, David Baker from New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was one that they didn't talk
about.
[SPEAKER_07]: The scientist working with them asked not
to disclose this information because they
[SPEAKER_07]: wanted to know if other people had had
this experience as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they had, they might mention
another group on board this craft.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one was only about three and a half
feet tall.
[SPEAKER_07]: I called him the supervisor because he
stood in the darkened hallway and he was
[SPEAKER_07]: incredibly frightening to Betty.
[SPEAKER_07]: She kept her eyes closed a lot because she
couldn't stand to look at him.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had larger eyes and a larger head in
proportion to his body than the leader and
[SPEAKER_07]: the examiner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, from what I could discover by
listening to and transcribing the hypnosis
[SPEAKER_07]: tapes, it appears that these alien beings
were interested in the human skeletal
[SPEAKER_07]: structure.
[SPEAKER_07]: They examined Betty's and Barney's hands
and feet and joints, their eyes,
[SPEAKER_07]: their skin, their mouth, their
reproductive systems, and many specimens
[SPEAKER_07]: were taken from their bodies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Skin scrapings, perhaps ova from Betty.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a sperm sample taken from
Barney.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just about every organ was open in their
body.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bodies were entered.
[SPEAKER_07]: Except for Betty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty's underwear did remain on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's Betty.
[SPEAKER_07]: She underwent a needle in the navel test.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is before we had amniocentesis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to play for you now Betty's
description of what she experienced.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then they wound me over on my back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the examiner had a long needle in his
hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I eat needle because of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I eat needle because of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I eat needle because of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I eat needle because of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I eat needle because of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I eat needle because of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was also in Betty's dream material.
[SPEAKER_07]: The difference between this and Betty's
dreams is that she experienced so much
[SPEAKER_07]: trauma as she was going through reliving
this experience that Dr. Simon actually
[SPEAKER_07]: had to end the session early.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know for sure if this actually
happened because I was not able to verify
[SPEAKER_07]: beyond reasonable doubt anything that
happened individually to Betty and Barney
[SPEAKER_07]: on board the craft.
[SPEAKER_07]: Only their statements of what happened
when they were together.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a good chance it did,
but I don't have what I would call
[SPEAKER_07]: scientific evidence that it did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Stan Friedman may have talked about
the star map to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: If he hasn't yet, I'm sure he will.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to go over this rather
quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is his area of expertise.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was the first one to publish on the
star map.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he wrote the chapter on the star map
in captured.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Betty said to the leader after the
examiner had left to work on Barney,
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you're not from around here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where are you from?
[SPEAKER_07]: And so he produced a star map that was
three dimensional.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like a holographic image from the
wall.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dr. Simon gave Betty the post hypnotic
suggestion that she would be able to draw
[SPEAKER_07]: this when she went home, if and only if
she could remember it accurately and it
[SPEAKER_07]: didn't cause her too much distress.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the stars, she did go home and do
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of the stars were pinpoints and
others were as big as a nickel.
[SPEAKER_07]: The solid lines represented trade routes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can see trade routes here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the sun up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can see solid lines.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the dotted lines represented
expeditions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's Marjorie Fitch with Stan Friedman.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is back in the 70s, I believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Marjorie was a school teacher from Ohio.
[SPEAKER_07]: She was also a member of MENSA.
[SPEAKER_07]: She was unmarried and had plenty of time
on her hands to express her interest and
[SPEAKER_07]: to do research this star map.
[SPEAKER_07]: She reasoned that if it really existed,
she would be able to find this place in
[SPEAKER_07]: our galaxy, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_07]: So she started building three dimensional
models using silk string and beads.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in all, she built 26 models before she
was able to find a match.
[SPEAKER_07]: It took her four years to find the match.
[SPEAKER_07]: The hard part was in getting the accurate
distance data because you can't just order
[SPEAKER_07]: these catalogs.
[SPEAKER_07]: She had to go to the university,
to the astronomy department, Ohio State
[SPEAKER_07]: University.
[SPEAKER_07]: And copy, hand copy the information from
those catalogs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of the astronomy departments
that she attempted didn't even have this
[SPEAKER_07]: information.
[SPEAKER_07]: Libraries didn't have it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So she had a difficult time getting it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But finally, a new catalog was released
and she found a match.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 1972, she completed her work when the
last three stars were found.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a photograph of one of her
models.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is her identification.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now she was having difficulty finding
scientists to vet her work for accuracy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stan Friedman was called in by Coral
Lorenzen from Afro and asked if he would
assist Marjorie in this.
[SPEAKER_07]: He went to Marjorie's house.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was impressed by her work.
[SPEAKER_07]: And by her intelligence.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he actually did find a number of
scientists who were willing to vet her
[SPEAKER_07]: work.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was accurate.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what she found is your zeta reticuli,
zeta one, zeta two.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you can see that these lines,
sure, they're closer together than what
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty actually drew.
[SPEAKER_07]: The difference for this, and Marjorie
reasoned this out, with the astronomers,
[SPEAKER_07]: and they did accept her explanation as
being reasonable, is because Betty
[SPEAKER_07]: observed this as a three-dimensional map.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yet she put it on paper as a
two-dimensional map.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she was looking at it from a certain
angle and from a certain distance.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when they did the math, they found out
that what Marjorie has here represented
what Betty had.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they described seeing and then drew.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's her sun.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is now 39.2.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, 39.2 it says here, but I think the
updated one is 39.3 light years away from
[SPEAKER_07]: the sun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Zeta one and zeta two are one-eighth of a
light year apart.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they are able to support planets,
if they have planets, in a stable orbit.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not so close that they wouldn't
have a stable orbit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some interesting facts.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the pattern stars are sunlight
stars that only 5% of the thousand stars
[SPEAKER_07]: in our local galactic neighborhood out 54
light years are sunlight.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all the sunlight stars in the volume
of space on the map are in the pattern.
[SPEAKER_07]: The base stars are at least a billion
years apart.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's older than the sun and can support
planets in a stable orbit.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are all on a plane like pepperoni on
a pizza rather than like raisins in a loaf
[SPEAKER_07]: of phrasing bread.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it would be easier to travel from one
to the other instead of jumping all over
[SPEAKER_07]: the galaxy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Betty reported also that she saw a
book on board this craft.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the year 2000, August of 2000,
I asked her if she could reproduce for me
[SPEAKER_07]: on paper the symbols in that book,
some of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: She, her memory had faded at that point.
[SPEAKER_07]: She had difficulty with this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This may not be an accurate representation
of what she saw, but she did this for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were arranged in six columns.
[SPEAKER_07]: She said the book seemed to be constructed
of thin shiny plastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was approximately an inch thick and the
text was embedded in the plastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: She asked the leader if she could take
this as her proof that this experience
[SPEAKER_07]: actually occurred.
[SPEAKER_07]: He initially said yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then that nasty little supervisor saw that
she had it and took it away from her.
[SPEAKER_07]: She remained behind on the craft arguing
for this book.
[SPEAKER_07]: She was really angry.
[SPEAKER_07]: While they took Barney back down the path
and put him into the vehicle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if you heard my lecture yesterday,
I told you in my comparative analysis,
[SPEAKER_07]: I discovered that under Betty's dream
account of what happened, she said that
[SPEAKER_07]: the symbols that she and Barney were
returned at the same time and that they
[SPEAKER_07]: stood outside the car and watched the
spacecraft leave.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not what they stated independently
under hypnosis.
[SPEAKER_07]: What they stated under hypnosis was that
Barney was returned to the car first.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney stated he sat on his gun when he
was put back into the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: He then saw Betty coming down the path.
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't report seeing the leader,
but Betty said the leader was with her and
[SPEAKER_07]: then dropped her off at a certain point.
[SPEAKER_07]: She walked toward the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: She opened the door.
[SPEAKER_07]: She picked up the dog, Delcy, and said,
Barney, let's get out and look at this
[SPEAKER_07]: thing leave.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is even so different from Betty's
dreams that they were standing in a
[SPEAKER_07]: different location under hypnosis than
they were in Betty's dreams.
This leads me to believe that this was a
real experience that both of them told Dr.
[SPEAKER_07]: Simon about as they relived it under
regression.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Simon said this really had occurred.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd be able to find the location,
and they did.
[SPEAKER_07]: On Labor Day 1965, they did find the
induction spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see here's Route 175.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Millbrook Road.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where the men were in the road.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a path through the woods.
[SPEAKER_07]: The craft landed right here in the sandy
soil area.
[SPEAKER_07]: They remember the sandy soil, and it is
the only area in that part of New
[SPEAKER_07]: Hampshire that has these physical
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_07]: They looked and looked.
[SPEAKER_07]: They could never find a place until they
were driving along.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd go up there and spend weekends.
[SPEAKER_07]: Different members of the family would go
and camp out, and then go look for this.
[SPEAKER_07]: On this particular day, Barney just seemed
to remember he was driving along.
[SPEAKER_07]: He made the right turns.
[SPEAKER_07]: He stopped the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: They got out.
[SPEAKER_07]: They walked through the woods and found
this area.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was asleep in the back seat of the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: They said, oh, Kathy, you have to see
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was too tired.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't get up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, I'll see it the next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: As years went on, I saw dozens and dozens
of times.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go there today, it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a housing development there.
[SPEAKER_07]: The road has been paved.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are side roads.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are houses everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks nothing like this, but this is
Betty standing on the capture site.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is another map.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the map of their trip home.
[SPEAKER_07]: They heard the second series of beeps
right here around the Ashland area.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was 37 miles to Concord, 17 miles from
Northfield to Concord, and then 47 miles
[SPEAKER_07]: back to Portsmouth.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they were in Thornton at 12.45 a.m.,
they would have arrived in Ashland at
[SPEAKER_07]: about 3.30.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if they stayed on Route 3,
it was only 16 miles.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they turned off under 175, it was only
21 miles.
[SPEAKER_07]: My husband and I drove this group over and
over again and tried to get lost.
[SPEAKER_07]: We took every side road we could.
[SPEAKER_07]: We could never get lost for more than 45
minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, after the hypnosis sessions were
over, Barney was feeling better.
[SPEAKER_07]: He and Betty once again turned to this
political activities.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're civil rights activities,
full force.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of this was to remain confidential
information, never to be released.
[SPEAKER_07]: The three of us were invited to Lyndon
Johnson's inauguration and attended that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's Barney with U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: Senator Tom McIntyre from the state of New
Hampshire on January 19th, 1965.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were active in the civil rights
movement.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney was appointed to the New Hampshire
State Advisory Committee for the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: Civil Rights Commission on May 4,
1965.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was also appointed to the Office of
Economic Opportunity.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was the Executive Director of the,
Chairman of the Executive Committee for
[SPEAKER_07]: the Rockingham County Community Action
Program that he and Betty helped found in
[SPEAKER_07]: the state of, in Portsmouth, New
Hampshire, for Rockingham County.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they were very well known around the
state of New Hampshire, very politically
[SPEAKER_07]: involved, and the worst thing that could
ever happen to them would, for this
[SPEAKER_07]: information to be made public,
they'd lose their credibility.
[SPEAKER_07]: They feared that they would probably lose
their jobs as a result.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were contacted by a newspaper
reporter from Austin in August of 1965.
[SPEAKER_07]: John Wood Luttrell.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had heard, through gossip, from a
person who was supposed to maintain
[SPEAKER_07]: confidentiality, who had listened to some
of the hypnosis tapes and had information
[SPEAKER_07]: that she repeated to this newspaper
reporter as a violation of
[SPEAKER_07]: confidentiality.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney, he asked to meet with Betty and
Barney because he wanted to publish this
[SPEAKER_07]: story.
[SPEAKER_07]: They said, Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_07]: This has to remain confidential.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what happened?
[SPEAKER_07]: On October 25, 1965, it was a regular day,
they got up and they went to work,
[SPEAKER_07]: and all of a sudden, the media was all
over them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Outside their offices, wanting to come
into their offices, John Luttrell had
[SPEAKER_07]: published this on the front page of the
Boston Traveler.
[SPEAKER_07]: It ran for five days.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a horrible experience for my
family.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty and Barney were panicking.
[SPEAKER_07]: They came to my grandparents' house.
[SPEAKER_07]: I lived across the street from my
grandparents.
[SPEAKER_07]: We met as a family to attempt to determine
what we were going to do about this,
[SPEAKER_07]: and Betty and Barney, at that point,
decided that maybe they would tell the
[SPEAKER_07]: real story.
[SPEAKER_07]: About what happened to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: They also spent one night with an officer
on Peace Air Force Base, Ben Sweatt.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll read about him in my book.
[SPEAKER_07]: He retired as a full colonel from the
Pentagon.
[SPEAKER_07]: They decided after this, in early
November, November 3rd, I believe it was,
[SPEAKER_07]: 1965, to speak publicly for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had spoken about their experience to
their church members at one time,
[SPEAKER_07]: and they had, without being on the agenda,
stood up briefly at the two-state study
group in Quincy, Massachusetts,
in early November of 1963, and talked
[SPEAKER_07]: about their signing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that was it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was done confidentially, they thought.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they did.
[SPEAKER_07]: John Fuller was at that first time that
they spoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were at the Unitarian Church in
Dover, New Hampshire, spoke to a packed
[SPEAKER_07]: crowd.
[SPEAKER_07]: The church was filled.
[SPEAKER_07]: The basement of the church was filled with
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was cold and rainy, and there were
people standing outside the church.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had to set up speakers everywhere,
and John Fuller was in the audience.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were interested.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were introduced by the public
information officer from Peace Air Force
[SPEAKER_07]: Base, and they did not talk about their
abduction.
[SPEAKER_07]: They only talked about their signing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ben Sweatt introduced John Fuller to Betty
and Barney.
[SPEAKER_07]: John Fuller talked to them about the
possibility of writing their story in a
[SPEAKER_07]: book, and eventually they did agree,
and Dr. Simon agreed to join them.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Interrupted Journey was published in
the fall of 1966.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, two of the original investigators
that I haven't mentioned, if you know the
[SPEAKER_07]: story at all, were Robert Homan and C.D.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jackson.
[SPEAKER_07]: They worked for IBM.
[SPEAKER_07]: Robert Homan was a writer.
[SPEAKER_07]: C.D.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jackson was a senior engineer.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were in contact with Betty and Barney
again, and convinced Betty to participate
[SPEAKER_07]: in psychophysics experiments with them in
order to vector in the craft.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have all of the letters that Robert
Homan wrote to Betty about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: They went up.
[SPEAKER_07]: They visited Betty and Barney.
[SPEAKER_07]: They went back to the site.
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually scripted Betty, and some of
this script is in the appendix of this
[SPEAKER_07]: book.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've devoted two chapters to the
experiments that they did.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were attempting to obtain hardware
for IBM according to what I can gather
[SPEAKER_07]: from the letters that Robert Homan wrote.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were not able to do that,
but the strange thing is this experiment
[SPEAKER_07]: was confidential.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was a teenager, I wasn't aware of
why these UFOs were landing on my
[SPEAKER_07]: grandparents' farm, but I think it might
have had something to do with this
[SPEAKER_07]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I know that it had.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't prove scientifically they landed
there because of the experiment,
[SPEAKER_07]: but there was physical trace evidence.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were observed.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I write about it in the book.
[SPEAKER_07]: Observed by a commercial pilot who was a
neighbor of ours who saw it coming at
[SPEAKER_07]: night.
[SPEAKER_07]: It woke up my grandparents as it sheared
off the tops of some trees.
[SPEAKER_07]: It woke up my brother who was sleeping,
and the physical trace evidence was on the
[SPEAKER_07]: ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: The trees were burned.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was investigated.
[SPEAKER_07]: One afternoon, I was an amateur
astronomer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was standing outside setting up my
telescope.
[SPEAKER_07]: I looked across the street over my
grandparents' barn, and there's a UFO.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was close enough that I could see the
windows in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm jumping up and down.
[SPEAKER_07]: UFO!
[SPEAKER_07]: UFO!
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm yelling.
[SPEAKER_07]: My mother comes running out.
[SPEAKER_07]: She takes one look.
[SPEAKER_07]: She grabs me by the arm.
[SPEAKER_07]: She takes me back into the house and says,
stay away from the windows.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, after Barney died, the experiments
with Homan and Jackson ended, but Betty
[SPEAKER_07]: continued to look for UFOs.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, she was a little credulous in
some of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: She got to the point where sometimes she
wasn't able to differentiate between
[SPEAKER_07]: conventional aircraft and UFOs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Between 80 and 95 percent, depending upon
what report you're reading, the
[SPEAKER_07]: statistical analysis you're reading of UFO
sightings, are conventional aircraft
[SPEAKER_07]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: When Betty saw finally that they were
conventional, she identified them as
[SPEAKER_07]: conventional.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you see here is one of her better
photographs of something.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't say that this is a flying saucer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't say it's an extraterrestrial
craft, but I thought it was interesting
[SPEAKER_07]: because it is saucer-shaped.
[SPEAKER_07]: She said it hovered over her car.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the original slide of this,
you can see someone standing right here in
[SPEAKER_07]: this window.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that was rather interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was another one too, a fiery orb
that Betty photographed.
[SPEAKER_07]: This all culminated four years of files,
of Betty's files, the hypnosis tapes,
[SPEAKER_07]: all of her memoirs went into this book and
culminated and captured the Betty and
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney Hill UFO experience with my
stand-in premium and myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank you very much for coming
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The story has been being told for some
time since the late 60s.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a new story.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have done a lot of research that puts
information out that hasn't been put out
[SPEAKER_01]: before, the new book captured,
but it's an important story on several
[SPEAKER_01]: different levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first abduction experience to
get any serious attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't the first abduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one to get attention in John
Fuller's book, The Interrupted Journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it got attention in spite of the
efforts of Betty and Barney because they
[SPEAKER_01]: were very much concerned about what the
impact would be on their lives if this
[SPEAKER_01]: story got out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Betty was a social worker, a supervisor in
the welfare department, state of New
[SPEAKER_01]: Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barney worked for the post office,
was very active in civil rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing they needed was public
attention about the strangest story you
[SPEAKER_01]: can imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad enough to see a flying saucer.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have been seeing them for years,
many years, even seeing crash flying
[SPEAKER_01]: saucers, as you heard in the previous
talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, we're not talking about dead
bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about live ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not talking about wreckage.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about a craft that comes
down, does its thing, and leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: takes them on board against their will.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a crazy story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they made every effort to keep the
story from getting out in the public
[SPEAKER_01]: because they were honestly and sincerely
concerned about what it would mean to
[SPEAKER_01]: their lives, their jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you may have noticed, this is an
interracial couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was 1961 in New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such couples were not very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very special people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I surprise some people by pointing out
that even though you notice Barney died in
[SPEAKER_01]: 1969, February, I met him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He and Betty and I had dinner in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1968, November.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was interesting because I got a
call from the local, the big radio
[SPEAKER_01]: station, big television station,
KDKA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had done, I got started in public
involvement on UFOs because I did a
[SPEAKER_01]: program on KDKA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Called, surprisingly enough, Contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a call in show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had asked Frank Edwards,
who had a best selling book, about flying
[SPEAKER_01]: saucers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I want to go public, Frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had met Frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had been active for several years in
finding out about saucers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me some names, Frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a newsman in Indianapolis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me some names in Pittsburgh where
I was living and working for Westinghouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them was the producer of this
show, Contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I called them and gave them a spiel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually being a nuclear physicist
working for Westinghouse, we're gold
[SPEAKER_01]: plated credentials in Pittsburgh.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you want to buy a house,
how much do you want to borrow?
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But their response was pretty much,
don't call us, we'll call you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, less than a month later,
they called me at 630 at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could I please be on their show at seven o
'clock?
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody had canceled at the last minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Lord knows how many people they called
before they got somebody like me who was
[SPEAKER_01]: willing to go on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't as good at handling the noisy
negativists then as I am now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But somebody at work at Westinghouse heard
me, asked me to talk to her book review
[SPEAKER_01]: club, which was looking at Frank's book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave my first lecture in her living
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the show many times over the next
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, after I'd done several shows
for them, I got a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: Betty and Barney Hill are coming to town.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought you might like to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now normally, stations won't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They protect their guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they called me, told me what hotel they
were staying at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called them, went down, we had dinner
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was very favorably impressed by them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'd read the Look Magazine article
and John Fuller's book and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can truthfully say I had a chance to
interact with both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen Betty many times since at her
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did television shows, The Tomorrow
Show, other shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: My movie UFOs are real.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some copies outside, interview
done at Betty's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a very special twosome here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the dates, you'll see
Betty lived a much longer time than
[SPEAKER_01]: Barney.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the proclamations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The protagonists in this interesting
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people with excellent reputations in
their community who did not seek out
[SPEAKER_01]: publicity talked to a lawyer about keeping
the story from coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, there's nothing you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: A reporter got ahold of it who wanted to
interview them from a Boston newspaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the last thing they wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you want to interview Dr. Simon,
the psychiatrist.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't having any either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an interesting saga.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was second marriages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they both had been married before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a very special couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look at the next slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another character in this drama was
Delcey, their dog, who was with them on
[SPEAKER_01]: the trip and whose behavior indicated
great concern at some time hiding under
[SPEAKER_01]: the seat, as I recall it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she's not the little critter we want
to talk about the most tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look at the next slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you'll hear all kinds of crazy
stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things about important stories
like Roswell and the Hill case is that the
[SPEAKER_01]: nasty, noisy negativists really work
overtime trying to put out garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see every aspect of each case
being attacked by somebody who doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know what he's talking about or if he
does, is intentionally lying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to pass judgment on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went on a trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Betty had a week's vacation coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barney wanted to do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were fairly newly married.
[SPEAKER_01]: Celebrate in a special way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Betty had never been to Niagara Falls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barney got time off from work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, she had a vacation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they decided to go to Niagara Falls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's romantic objective,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is sort of like a honeymoon for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you may not recognize this person,
but she's standing right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Kathleen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time, she was 13 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I say that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're not supposed to tell a
woman's age, but that's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a girl's age.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had been at Niagara Falls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she had told them about her trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that helped them understand why it was
worth going there and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The objective here was to drive to Niagara
Falls, come back through Montreal,
[SPEAKER_01]: come on back home.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd have a great weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: A break in the activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Kathy was around at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some people who will tell
you she was only three years old at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does she know what was going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: They left off that little one.
[SPEAKER_01]: 13 and 3 are not the same, in case you
hadn't noticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were following a route.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd gone over to Niagara Falls,
which is from Thousand Islands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came up through Montreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had a great time in Montreal and headed
east from Montreal to Coaticook.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I pronounced it properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close enough?
[SPEAKER_01]: Down through Colebrook.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a border between Canada and the
United States here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is lovely farmland, dairy farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been on that road.
[SPEAKER_01]: A rural area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Montreal isn't rural, believe me,
but the countryside is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things were going as one might expect
them to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought they might stay over in
Montreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barney got lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the signs were in French, and he
didn't speak French.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so after they got through the town,
they decided, oh, what the heck.
[SPEAKER_01]: He felt he was feeling great.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could drive on home to Portsmouth,
New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not busy roads once you get past
Montreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was accustomed to working at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So away we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's Coaticook.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's Kathleen's turn to say something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty and Barney stopped for dinner in
Coaticook.
[SPEAKER_07]: They decided to use up the remainder of
their Canadian money.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you might have heard that Barney was
very upset during this trip because he had
[SPEAKER_07]: encountered some hoodlums who gave him a
rough time about being married to a white
[SPEAKER_07]: woman.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is false.
[SPEAKER_07]: What actually happened is that Betty and
Barney went into a restaurant.
[SPEAKER_07]: There were two young men in there who had
what Barney described as duck bill
[SPEAKER_07]: haircuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it reminded him of the haircuts that
hoodlum types were wearing at that time
[SPEAKER_07]: frame.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they were conventionally dressed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Barney stated that they were very nice
young men.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a nice dinner in the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they left.
[SPEAKER_07]: After they left, they traveled through the
Canadian countryside toward Vermont and
[SPEAKER_07]: then on to New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is one of the attractive farms that
they passed along the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And during the hypnosis, during this time
frame, Dr. Simon was asking Barney how he
[SPEAKER_07]: felt, what his emotional state was.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to play for you
now, in Barney's own words, how he felt.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that you could hear that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was what he stated is written up there
on the screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then they drove on and they passed
through Customs and Canaan, Vermont
[SPEAKER_07]: without any problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the route.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the route that they took.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's Colebrook.
[SPEAKER_07]: This would have been their first stop
after they left Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: They got gasoline there and stopped at a
restaurant again for a cup of coffee.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then they went on to Lancaster,
the next city down along Route 3,
[SPEAKER_07]: the major route that ran through northern
New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_07]: It still is the only major route in that
part of northern New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on to Twin Mountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the town of Colebrook.
[SPEAKER_07]: They stopped at a restaurant, their
Howard's Restaurant, and just had a cup of
[SPEAKER_07]: coffee.
[SPEAKER_07]: They knew it was the last opportunity
they'd have probably to have a cup of
[SPEAKER_07]: coffee that night before they went home.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as they were leaving the restaurant,
they noticed it was about 10 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are quieting down in New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_01]: They drove along to Lancaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you see cars here, and you think,
oh, it's pretty busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nobody out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was late.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1050 is late at night in rural New
Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is off season.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is before the leaves turn beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing much going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: No traffic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very few things open of a commercial
nature any place along this route.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pure and simple country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't be fooled by the cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: No traffic.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're driving south.
[SPEAKER_01]: Betty, on the passenger seat, of course,
saw a strange new light in the sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was watching the sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: The skies are clear and beautiful down
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not Smogsville country at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you'll see, the weather was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they saw this new light in the sky,
except it was sort of like a meteor,
[SPEAKER_01]: except it was going up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were going from north to south,
as you can see there.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first interview that was done at any
length with them after they made an
[SPEAKER_01]: initial report to the local police and
then Pease Air Force Base was done by
[SPEAKER_01]: Walter Webb.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a wheel at the planetarium in
Boston, a lecturer.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he finished, I guess he was assistant
directors.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was an investigator for the National
Investigations Committee on Aerial
[SPEAKER_01]: Phenomena, NICAP, one of the two major
groups at that time, APRO and NICAP,
[SPEAKER_01]: Earth Phenomena Research Organization
National Investigations Committee on
[SPEAKER_01]: Aerial Phenomena.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, after the event we'll be talking
about, Betty went to the library,
[SPEAKER_01]: got a book out by Major Donald Kehoe,
who had pretty much founded NICAP and was
[SPEAKER_01]: director.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had an address to which you could
write to report a sighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they requested that sightings be
reported.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she wrote a letter detailing what
happened during this experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as she knew at the time,
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, in turn, passed this on to
Walter Webb.
[SPEAKER_01]: NICAP was in Washington, DC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about New Hampshire,
nearest big city, Boston, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walter Webb was their big shot
investigator in Boston.
[SPEAKER_01]: They passed Betty's letter, naturally
typed.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a social worker.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a supervisor in the welfare
department of the state of New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was accustomed to writing reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was detailed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Walter called them within a couple of
days after getting a letter from NICAP and
[SPEAKER_01]: arranged to meet them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a copy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a copy of that report.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's still around, incidentally.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little older, as most of us are now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a quote here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The couple initially thought they were
observing a falling star, only it moved
[SPEAKER_01]: upward, a plane or a satellite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first stop was near Twin Mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're getting up to 11.20 PM,
even quieter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peaceful countryside.
[SPEAKER_01]: No hoodlums.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were bright colors, like bright
orange light, almost a reddish beam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were like a blue light on a
police cruiser.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just a flash, flash of different
colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd never seen anything like it
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was moving quite fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now she's watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barney's driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I saw it go in front of the moon,
I was sort of fascinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kept watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now note that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A later explanation is that this was
Jupiter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I can't remember the last time Jupiter
went in front of the moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's half a billion miles out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The moon's a quarter of a million miles
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's look at the next slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was intrigued, in other words.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's telling Barney, incidentally,
about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's seeing a UFO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Betty, there are no UFOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was poo-pooing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was driving south.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's watching this thing and reporting to
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went through a Franconian notch,
which is, now we say mountains in New
[SPEAKER_01]: Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're on the East Coast and you say
mountains, you don't mean the Rockies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The highest point east of the Mississippi
is in New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mount Washington are one of the highest
points, together with North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you do have rolling country and some
sharp hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get this Franconian notch they call
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see why.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sharp notch, not slowly rolling down
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was taken a little later time in the
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they get gorgeous color up there,
but normally in October, not September.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll have busloads full of
tourists looking at the color,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not September 20th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we see Cannon Mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a, well, you can see it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a tramway that goes up and down,
runs most of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ski lift, if you want to call it that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at this time of year, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have skiing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful local area, well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people have suggested that what
they saw was the light at the top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: mountain there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you will hear about all the things
this crazy light did, you realize it
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lights at the top of the mountain stay in
the same place normally.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't move around.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't fly in front of the moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's look at the next slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I get a real kick out of the
explanations about point sources,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jupiter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also watched it go past one of the
real emblems of New Hampshire,
[SPEAKER_01]: the old man of the mountain, until it
fell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went by where it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were up there doing a television
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this shape, as you can see,
first seen in 1805 by a white man,
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like an old man of the mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: They saw the UFO alongside it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's 48 feet from chin to brow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about 1 and 1 half times the
height.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a point of light, in other
words.
[SPEAKER_01]: I better show you up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the old man of the mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: This now fell into a lake, and you can't
see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the saucer was next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people want to explain it away and
ignore this part of the testimony.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was 48 feet, 1 and 1 half times
would be 72 feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hardly a point source of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many of the so-called explanations
disappear.
[SPEAKER_07]: They then made a second stop and got out
of the car to look at this object in the
[SPEAKER_07]: sky.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty had told Barney that it was moving
erratically.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they both speculated that perhaps it
was the movement of the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Betty was looking at this through
binoculars as she was riding along.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they decided to stop to see if it
actually was moving erratically or if it
[SPEAKER_07]: was only an object that was moving
smoothly in the sky.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I want to play for you now Barney's
description of what they saw.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to report it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all, it wasn't far.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was about 1,000 feet, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it is not a paper cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was too fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It moved too fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would go up and down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It couldn't go back so fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could go away and come back toward the
west.
[SPEAKER_04]: And without looking as if it turned,
it would come straight back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would go like a, I don't know,
I think of a paddle and a ball of the
rubber.
You hit the ball and the ball goes
straight up and comes straight back
without a circle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think only a jet could fly that
fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he thinks only a jet could fly that
fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: The only problem is it was completely
silent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it had unconventional lighting.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they could see the windows in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There were no red lights at that time.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was only a row of white lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it appeared to be rotating.
[SPEAKER_07]: They then returned to their car and drove
south.
[SPEAKER_07]: The next area that they would have come to
is known as Indian Head.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the Indian Head area where the
tourists spend the night.
[SPEAKER_07]: There were cottages there at the time and
there were also some tourist attractions.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you see here is Indian Head.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Indian Head Resort is there.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 1961, there were only cabins.
[SPEAKER_07]: Today it has grown into a big,
beautiful resort.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did want to mention that in
September of 2011, the Indian Head Resort
[SPEAKER_07]: is going to host a 50th anniversary event
to commemorate Betty and Barney Hill's
[SPEAKER_07]: experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they are going to dedicate a memorial
to Betty and Barney.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there will be guided tours of the
close encounter route.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be giving those and also lecturing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope that you will consider coming to
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: As Betty and Barney passed those cabins,
Betty saw someone standing in one of the
[SPEAKER_07]: windows.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a man standing in a window.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she thought to herself, well,
I could end all of this right now if we
[SPEAKER_07]: just stopped and spent the night at this
cabin.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then she thought, she was so curious,
she wanted to see more of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Barney, having left this very desolate
area, told Dr. Simon, and I quote,
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel safe unless in the barren hostility
of the wooded area.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been here before and I feel comforted
that I see a familiar place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now Barney started to talk to Dr. Simon
about Betty's reaction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Simon had asked him.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he said, Betty is becoming excited
about this thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Betty rarely becomes excited about
anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: So something is going on here that is
unusual.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that I want to stop and get a
better look at this thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as he was driving south, he was looking
for another place where he could pull over
[SPEAKER_07]: to the side of the road and stop.
[SPEAKER_07]: But before he had the opportunity to find
a spot, this craft shifted ahead of them
[SPEAKER_07]: and stopped directly over the top of their
vehicle.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then descended toward them,
causing Barney to have to stop the car
[SPEAKER_07]: directly in the middle of the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're at 12.15 AM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he stopped in the middle of the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you might think, well, that was not a
very bright thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was nobody around.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no traffic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, it continued to have a
forward look, facing me as if it swung and
[SPEAKER_01]: did not move from its position,
but just swung around with the front still
[SPEAKER_01]: facing me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it moved to my left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I continued to look and began walking
across the highway from the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got out of the car, going across the
highway.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a field over there.
And
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney walked toward the craft,
holding the binoculars up to his eyes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I want to do now is to play for
you two tape recordings of Barney's
[SPEAKER_07]: statements about what he saw.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first recording is his first session
with Dr. Simon.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dr. Simon brought on this tremendous
reaction and release of emotion in Barney
[SPEAKER_07]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the place where Barney's mental
block set in.
[SPEAKER_07]: He recalled a close encounter with this
craft.
[SPEAKER_07]: He recalled observing non-human entities
onboard the craft.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, his statement to Walter Webb in
the initial report was that they were
[SPEAKER_07]: somehow not human.
[SPEAKER_07]: In Betty's letter, written September 25,
1961, to NYCAP, she reported that Barney
[SPEAKER_07]: had observed figures onboard this craft.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was something about their
appearance that had frightened him so
[SPEAKER_07]: badly that he had developed a mental
block.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were considering finding a
competent psychiatrist who would use
[SPEAKER_07]: hypnosis to help Barney understand what it
was that caused this mental block.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first tape I'm going to play for
you is this first session.
Keep looking and stay there.
And just keep looking.
Just keep looking.
Could you hear him tell you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I got to pull these binoculars away
from my eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if I don't, I'll just keep staying
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you hear him tell you this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He felt you said it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know he isn't there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just stay there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's saying to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how did you get my hand to this door?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pull binoculars away.
[SPEAKER_02]: God give me strength.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pull him down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Run!
[SPEAKER_02]: Pull those binoculars down and run!
God.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, Denni, God, give me strength.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to get away.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to get away, Betty!
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calm down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calm down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm driving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calm down.
[SPEAKER_02]: How could you be sure he was telling you
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Calm down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're still asleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: How could you be sure he was telling you
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys... Guys... I've never seen his eyes
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you said they were friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said they were friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually the leader was friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you know the other one was the
leader?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everybody moved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone was standing there looking at me.
But everybody moved.
To these levers or in the back or they
went to this big board.
It looked like a board.
[SPEAKER_02]: And only this one with the black shiny
jacket in the scarf stayed at the window.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some real terror there you might
have noticed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I'm going to play the excerpt from the
second hypnosis session where Barney was
[SPEAKER_07]: reliving the same experience with left's
emotion and was able to give Dr. Simon a
[SPEAKER_07]: little more detail about what he observed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed with my binoculars that there
were about eleven men now I thought
looking down at me and they suddenly made
a turn to what I thought was a panel and I
could see their arms going up and there
was one that kept looking down and I kept
going closer and I could see two red
lights coming out from the tip of this
thing that did not look like a plane at
all or a helicopter and I could see a long
something coming down from the center and
I kept going closer and closer and I
thought oh my god what is this thing and I
felt myself being told to come closer and
I was greatly confused and I blinked my
eyes and I thought this can't be real and
I shook my head and turned it away and
looked back and I thought oh god it's
there what is this thing and I put my hand
toward my gun and I could not put my hand
there and I could not understand why my
hands kept going up with the binoculars
[SPEAKER_04]: and I was told to keep the binoculars up
and keep looking up and keep coming closer
[SPEAKER_04]: no harm would come to me and that's when I
opened my hands and the binoculars fell
[SPEAKER_04]: around my neck and I ran screaming back to
the car that they were going to capture us
[SPEAKER_04]: and yet I could not understand what they
wanted to capture us for and I thought I
should report this to the police if ever I
could find a call box or anything or a
restaurant open because this was very
unusual for something to do that and I
thought of the military and I thought
since they had on blackjack the one
looking at me had on a blackjacket he must
have been a military officer and yet I
could not quite understand why they were
doing what they were doing and there was
[SPEAKER_07]: no sound coming from this thing Barney
then finally managed to pull those
[SPEAKER_07]: binoculars down and when he arrived home
the strap the leather strap on the
[SPEAKER_07]: binoculars was broken and this must have
been the point where he broke that strap
[SPEAKER_07]: where he pulled them down so violently in
order to overcome this the this thought
[SPEAKER_07]: that he was getting from the leader on
this craft to keep them up at his eyes he
[SPEAKER_07]: pulled it down and ran back to the car
screaming to Betty that they had to get
[SPEAKER_07]: out of the there they were going to be
captured Betty was seated in the car all
[SPEAKER_07]: of this time the door was cracked open I
imagine the interior light in the car was
[SPEAKER_07]: on and she was calling for Barney after a
few minutes and when he didn't come back
[SPEAKER_07]: she was becoming very upset and she felt
that if he hadn't come back when he did
[SPEAKER_07]: she was going to get out of the car and go
into that field and look for him as Barney
[SPEAKER_07]: was returning to the car running back he
noticed that the craft had shifted
[SPEAKER_07]: overhead above the vehicle and he told
Betty to look up and see if she could see
[SPEAKER_07]: the craft so she rolled down the window
and she looked up and she couldn't see it
[SPEAKER_07]: all she could see is blackness she
couldn't see the stars she couldn't see
[SPEAKER_07]: the sky she saw only blackness and I'm
going to play for you now her description
[SPEAKER_00]: of what happened next she's inside the car
looking up out the window it was this beep
[SPEAKER_03]: beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep
beep noise and Barney said what's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah what's that noise?
[SPEAKER_03]: and I said I don't know it sounds oh I can
think of some kind of electrical signal
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody's you know it's beep beep beep
and I thought well I wonder oh no why
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't I learn the mosque code because
maybe this is the mosque code and I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know it and I thought well maybe it's
electrical it's the shock get it you know
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't so I put my hand on the metal of
the car and I kept feeling and feeling and
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't feel any shock no electric shock
but the whole car was vibrating the car
[SPEAKER_07]: was vibrating and there was a tingling
sensation that passed through Betty's and
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney's bodies and caused them to feel a
little numb the next thing they knew they
[SPEAKER_07]: were 35 miles south of the field they
hadn't spoken another word to each other
[SPEAKER_07]: you would think that Betty would have
asked Barney what he had observed in the
[SPEAKER_07]: field you would think that they would be
discussing this thing they didn't they
[SPEAKER_07]: didn't speak for 35 miles as far as they
could remember they know from the signs on
[SPEAKER_07]: the road how many miles to some place you
see okay this is a map okay this is Twin
[SPEAKER_07]: Mountain their first stop was at the Mount
Cleveland picnic area here just south of
[SPEAKER_07]: Twin Mountain at about 1050 p.m.
[SPEAKER_07]: it might have been a little earlier than
that when they arrived but when I was
[SPEAKER_07]: driving through reenacting their trip for
myself I had to drive more slowly than
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty and Barney were driving back then
it's more heavily populated now Barney was
[SPEAKER_07]: driving along at a fairly rapid clip 50-55
miles an hour according to his testimony
[SPEAKER_07]: we had to slow down as we were passing
through here's the old man of the mountain
[SPEAKER_07]: that's the second stop I estimated it was
about 1150 but when Betty passed by Cannon
[SPEAKER_07]: Mountain she told Dr. Simon that she
looked at her watch and she thought it was
[SPEAKER_07]: about 1120 at that time so I again may be
off this is the third stop at the close
[SPEAKER_07]: encounter field they thought it was about
midnight then I arrived it would have been
[SPEAKER_07]: about 1215 and then later on they found
out that there was a capture site that
[SPEAKER_07]: they didn't recall initially until
hypnosis and this is where that was
[SPEAKER_01]: located now a point that needs to be made
when we were there to do a movie and I
[SPEAKER_01]: won't talk about the movie but when you're
standing at that location where Barney was
[SPEAKER_01]: looking with his glasses and you realize
that very shortly after that he gets off
[SPEAKER_01]: the main road onto a secondary road and
then onto a dirt road there is no possible
[SPEAKER_01]: way he would have done that on his own
makes absolutely no sense he was being
[SPEAKER_01]: directed to a rather unique spot in the
whole area it's a heavily wooded part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the country as you can see the trees are
tall this is not New Mexico desert this is
[SPEAKER_01]: wooded New Hampshire and yet they wind up
on this very narrow road no lights no
[SPEAKER_01]: traffic no people no buildings why would
anybody go there you know and they see a
[SPEAKER_01]: roadblock and beings men in the road they
couldn't make any sense out of this what
[SPEAKER_01]: was going on here is there an accident
there's no traffic there's no reason for
[SPEAKER_01]: there to be anybody there so let's look at
the next slide I just wanted to mention
[SPEAKER_07]: that in their conscious recollection there
was a roadblock they just didn't know when
[SPEAKER_01]: or where it occurred that was a mystery
and they saw this you can call it a fiery
[SPEAKER_01]: orb a bright light some source of light
ahead of them in the road was moving but
[SPEAKER_01]: they weren't moving I thought it might be
the moon but obviously the moon isn't down
[SPEAKER_01]: on road level it couldn't have been the
moon so they're totally puzzled about this
[SPEAKER_01]: situation what's going on what's happening
let's look at them and I'd like to play
[SPEAKER_07]: for you Barney's statement about that
experience this was part the moon be on
[SPEAKER_03]: the highway in that kind of position and I
could never seem to find any terrain up
there that would fit what I sort of
generally remember this thing was sitting
[SPEAKER_04]: there it's like and I kept remembering
these men flagging me down and then I sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of don't remember and now I remember okay
[SPEAKER_01]: next thing they remember is this gap they
see this orb whatever it is in the road
[SPEAKER_01]: they see men beings around it and then
it's like everything fades out and the
[SPEAKER_01]: next thing they remember is a number
another set of these buzzing beeping
[SPEAKER_01]: sounds the car shaking maybe and they're
35 miles down the road and now they're
[SPEAKER_01]: back in full consciousness except that
it's it's seamless they'd been alert and
[SPEAKER_01]: awake now they're alert and awake and in
between nothing how do you drive a car
[SPEAKER_01]: without knowing what you're doing you know
so let's look at the next one and so they
[SPEAKER_01]: kept on about their business coming down
this way heading Portsmouth is on the
[SPEAKER_01]: coast on the Atlantic coast Concord's the
capital and so many of the signs said how
[SPEAKER_01]: far it was to Concord that's your
measuring label here and they expected to
[SPEAKER_01]: get home about three in the morning but
that's not what happened they arrived home
[SPEAKER_07]: at 515 a.m.
[SPEAKER_07]: they checked their watches when they
arrived home but they were no longer
[SPEAKER_07]: working they wound them those watches
never worked again they went into the
[SPEAKER_07]: house Barney went into the house first he
looked at the clock it was about 515 a.m.
[SPEAKER_07]: he said arrived a little bit late later
than I anticipated Betty stayed outside
[SPEAKER_07]: walking the dog Delcey and she talked
about how she could hear the birds
[SPEAKER_01]: chirping it was already daylight this is
September mind you September 20th the
[SPEAKER_01]: birds shouldn't be chirping at three in
the morning Barney sensed a strange
[SPEAKER_07]: sensation in his groin a little itchiness
and he went into the bathroom and checked
[SPEAKER_07]: himself to see what was wrong he didn't
see anything then but not long after that
[SPEAKER_07]: 21 3 quarter inch growths appeared in a
perfect concentric circle on his groin
[SPEAKER_07]: later under hypnosis he would tell dr.
Simon that he could feel a cup like device
[SPEAKER_07]: being placed over his groin in that exact
location those growths became infected
[SPEAKER_07]: inflamed when Barney was undergoing
hypnosis with dr. Simon and he had to have
[SPEAKER_07]: them surgically removed at that time this
is two years after the event mind you but
[SPEAKER_07]: the growths appeared shortly there after
the event yeah okay but the inflammation
[SPEAKER_07]: was later yes it was later so I do want to
stress the point that the lab report
[SPEAKER_07]: stated that they were not venereal warts
the debunkers tend to say that that's what
[SPEAKER_07]: they were they were not he and Betty felt
clammy as if they had been contaminated by
[SPEAKER_07]: something more than anyone would feel just
from driving to monster from not Montreal
[SPEAKER_07]: to New Hampshire and there as I said the
watt the binocular strap was broken and
[SPEAKER_07]: their watches had stopped and never worked
again the tops of Barney's shoes were
[SPEAKER_07]: scraped he was a meticulous dresser he had
to wear those shoes for yard work after
[SPEAKER_07]: that he had no explanation logical
explanation for how this had happened they
[SPEAKER_07]: weren't just slightly scuffed they were
scraped his words were they were scraped
[SPEAKER_07]: they went into separate rooms and they
drew sketches of what they had observed
[SPEAKER_01]: standard practice you do it with your kids
they both say they saw something well you
[SPEAKER_01]: sit down here and draw what you saw and
you sit down here and draw what you saw so
[SPEAKER_01]: they each drew what they could recall this
is without hypnosis at this point in time
[SPEAKER_01]: and two drawings pretty darn similar and
it should be noted that these kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: wings or whatever you want to call them
slid out from the side so red light then
[SPEAKER_01]: gradually as it came closer to the ground
and there were windows with beings being
[SPEAKER_01]: seen on the other side neither one of
these two was a great artist you
[SPEAKER_01]: understand but close enough to say that
they were drawing the same thing this was
[SPEAKER_01]: a temporary apparently appendage I call it
a wing but that's probably not a good name
[SPEAKER_07]: for it okay and I just did want to mention
that Barney drew figures behind the
[SPEAKER_07]: windows whereas Betty did not that's
because Barney observed those figures when
[SPEAKER_07]: he was in the field and had the binoculars
and Betty was in the car so she was
[SPEAKER_07]: drawing what she saw initially in the car
before the craft shifted over the field
[SPEAKER_07]: and Barney walked toward it now Betty had
put on a fairly new dress the morning of
[SPEAKER_07]: the trip from Montreal to Portsmouth and
when she arrived home the zipper was torn
[SPEAKER_07]: at the top of the zipper there was a two
inch tear on one side and a one inch tear
[SPEAKER_07]: on the other side no mundane explanation
for that all she did is ride in the car
[SPEAKER_07]: she got out a few times she ate at a
couple of restaurants no explanation for
[SPEAKER_07]: this the lining was torn from waist to
hemline and the hem was torn down on one
[SPEAKER_07]: side she knew it had to be repaired so she
folded it up and she placed it in her
[SPEAKER_07]: closet the next time she went to her
closet to retrieve the dress it was
[SPEAKER_07]: covered with a pink powdery substance that
degraded the fabric and destroyed the
[SPEAKER_07]: dress she hung the dress up on the
clothesline the pink powder blew away but
[SPEAKER_07]: it had discolored the dress permanently
and this is the dress here you can see
[SPEAKER_07]: that part of it this area right here is
still blue that was the original blue
[SPEAKER_07]: color of the dress but there are areas
where it was completely saturated with
[SPEAKER_07]: this pink powdery substance and these were
the areas where Betty later told Dr. Simon
[SPEAKER_07]: that these alien beings who had abducted
her had wrapped their hands around her
[SPEAKER_07]: shoulders there's another view of the
dress you can see that some swaths have
[SPEAKER_07]: been cut out of the dress those were for
the chemical analyses that the dress
[SPEAKER_07]: underwent they underwent four chemical
analyses and I have written about that in
[SPEAKER_07]: CAPTUR3D and they also were used in a seed
growth experiment this is Phyllis Bodinger
[SPEAKER_07]: she has a master's degree in chemistry she
did the most extensive chemical analysis
[SPEAKER_07]: on the dress she was a research scientist
for BP Amaco previously Standard Oil for
[SPEAKER_07]: 35 years she specialized in petroleum
chemical and polymer analyses using
[SPEAKER_07]: spectroscopic techniques and currently she
is the technical director of Frontier
[SPEAKER_07]: Analysis Limited Laboratory in Chagrin
Falls, Ohio a quite respectable chemist
[SPEAKER_07]: you can read more about it in CAPTUR3D but
her conclusion at the end of this analysis
[SPEAKER_07]: was and I quote I am convinced that the
event did happen as determined by the
[SPEAKER_07]: chemical analysis I did on Betty Hill's
dress well my mother was the first person
[SPEAKER_07]: that Betty called when she arrived home
Barney had advised her that they should
[SPEAKER_07]: forget about the entire event that no good
could possibly come of it but Betty and my
[SPEAKER_07]: mother were very close and lived 20 miles
apart and so when she called my mother my
[SPEAKER_07]: mother suggested that she would call a
neighbor of ours who was a physicist and
[SPEAKER_07]: see what the physicist had to say about
this whole thing Betty was worried about
[SPEAKER_07]: contamination what might have happened to
them and the physicist told my mother to
[SPEAKER_07]: advise Betty that if she had a compass she
should take it out to the car to see how
[SPEAKER_07]: the needle of the compass would react she
did find a compass and she took it out and
[SPEAKER_07]: when she went out there she noticed there
were some new very shiny spots on the
[SPEAKER_07]: trunk of the vehicle that hadn't been
there the day before there were 12 to 18
[SPEAKER_07]: of them and they were very shiny and I'm
going to play for you both Betty's and
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney's descriptions of what those spots
looked like I also saw these spots this is
[SPEAKER_07]: a facsimile because none of us thought to
take a photograph of those spots but this
[SPEAKER_07]: is based upon Betty's and Barney's
descriptions and upon my memory of what I
[SPEAKER_01]: observed there was nothing about an
abduction up to this point in their minds
[SPEAKER_01]: so the significance wasn't yet known of
this whole experience it was like a
[SPEAKER_03]: lacquer put on over the car and even when
I waxed the car the spot still was shiny
[SPEAKER_03]: and it had been raining that day and the
car was all wet still wet and I thought
[SPEAKER_03]: well I started on the side of the car to
see what would happen and I kept going
[SPEAKER_03]: closer and closer to the trunk and then it
was when I started to go to the trunk of
[SPEAKER_03]: the compass that I noticed the shiny spots
on the trunk that they were these very
[SPEAKER_03]: very shiny spots and that the whole
cluster of them about the size of I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know half dollars or total dollar
something like that and they must have
[SPEAKER_03]: been oh 12 or 8, several dozen I would say
all around the spot and very shiny and
[SPEAKER_03]: when I just got the compass anywhere near
them the compass kept spinning around and
[SPEAKER_03]: around and around and at this I panicked I
got more upset at this one spot than I did
[SPEAKER_06]: at anything she said now let's listen to
what Barney said and I said how can you
not know if it isn't anything and then I
put the compass close to it and the
[SPEAKER_04]: compass would spin and spin and I could
move the compass a few inches to any spot
that did not connect to a spot on the
trunk that did not have a spot and the
[SPEAKER_07]: compass would drop down so you can see
that Betty and Barney's description of
[SPEAKER_07]: those spots and how the compass needle
reacted were consistent nobody understands
[SPEAKER_07]: why that would happen you understand the
spots were located in the exact location
[SPEAKER_07]: where the hills said they heard beeping or
buzzing sounds that caused the vehicle to
[SPEAKER_07]: vibrate and that vibration to cause their
bodies to tingle Betty washed and waxed
[SPEAKER_07]: the vehicle but the spots wouldn't rub out
but they faded away over the winter of
[SPEAKER_07]: 1961 to 1962 we I do have a letter in the
book quotes from a letter of a meeting
[SPEAKER_07]: that Betty and Barney had with Air Force
officers at their church rectory where
[SPEAKER_07]: they discussed the spots on the trunk of
the car and speculated about what might
[SPEAKER_07]: have caused this this wasn't part of the
official blue book record it was a meeting
[SPEAKER_07]: brought together by Betty and Barney could
never understand why these officers came
[SPEAKER_07]: to this meeting it was supposed to be to
listen to poetry written by one of the
[SPEAKER_07]: officers but after he read his poems the
officers asked Betty and Barney to stay
[SPEAKER_07]: and they had a conversation about the
spots on the trunk of the vehicle Barney
[SPEAKER_01]: knew people at the base because of his
work with civil rights you see so there
[SPEAKER_01]: was a connection with the base Peace Air
Force base just outside Portsmouth now
[SPEAKER_07]: there has been some speculation that they
might have just been weather spots weather
[SPEAKER_07]: spots developed when it rains atmospheric
pollutants drop down in the rain they
[SPEAKER_07]: deposit on the vehicle then the Sun comes
out and bakes those spots on the car and
[SPEAKER_07]: you have to use a chemical solution to get
them off they don't rub off very easily
[SPEAKER_07]: this is what weather marks look like and
you can see here that this is not what
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty's and Barney's marks looked like
does not fit the description and then here
[SPEAKER_07]: is the facsimile again just so that you
can see the difference they called the
[SPEAKER_01]: local police they advised them to call
nearby Peace Air Force base they did they
[SPEAKER_01]: made a report they were treated fairly
decently a record was kept here's the
[SPEAKER_01]: official project blue book air
intelligence information report it was
[SPEAKER_01]: taken seriously the report also included
the interesting where's the comment about
[SPEAKER_01]: the radar there what is that oh on this
one I can't read it though can you read
[SPEAKER_07]: there was a radar report it says it was
revealed that a strange incident occurred
[SPEAKER_07]: at 211 local on the 20th of September no
importance was attached to the incidents
[SPEAKER_07]: incident at the time subsequent
interrogation failed to bring out any
[SPEAKER_07]: information in addition to the that of the
extract of the daily controller and there
[SPEAKER_01]: was also a report on another radar
installation up in where are we in Vermont
[SPEAKER_01]: blue book tried to push this aside and
there have been a number of instances
[SPEAKER_01]: noted where they've changed files and
records and so forth but what I'm saying
[SPEAKER_01]: is here's a definite record of something
happening at the right time and place and
[SPEAKER_01]: so forth they were taken seriously but I
want to mention that this is the original
[SPEAKER_07]: handwritten report and in the original
reports the Air Force said that there was
[SPEAKER_07]: a strong inversion in that year in the
Lincoln New Hampshire area that night and
[SPEAKER_07]: in temperature inversion will cause a
distant object to appear much closer than
[SPEAKER_07]: it is and one of their favorite theories
was that this might explain UFO sightings
[SPEAKER_01]: that people have it was a favorite for the
Washington National Airport sightings the
[SPEAKER_01]: only trouble is when you check the weather
records there wasn't any temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: inversion and this is from the Mount Mount
Washington's the tallest point in New
[SPEAKER_01]: Hampshire tallest point on the East Coast
the official weather station archival
[SPEAKER_01]: records looking back on our records for
the dates in question it appears that the
[SPEAKER_01]: 19th and 20th are both beautiful late
summer days atop the rock pile Mount
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington was the rock pile they had some
of the strongest winds in the country on
[SPEAKER_01]: average terrible winters rugged kind of
place the evening and nighttime conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: for the 19th were quite tranquil winds
were from the west at around 25 miles per
[SPEAKER_01]: hour visibility was 130 miles throughout
the night but dropped to 75 miles during
[SPEAKER_01]: the morning hours of the 20th there was a
movie well we'll talk about that but in
[SPEAKER_01]: which the windshield wipers are shown
going like mad it wasn't raining when you
[SPEAKER_01]: got 130 miles visibility it's not bad
weather some critics have also stated that
[SPEAKER_07]: the weather people at the top of Mount
Washington would have observed the craft
[SPEAKER_07]: if it had really been there on that night
there was a letter written to the
[SPEAKER_07]: weathermen up there and they said that due
to their job the type of job they had they
[SPEAKER_07]: only went outside of the building at night
in order to check the temperature gauges
[SPEAKER_07]: outside and then they returned to the
building they would not have observed
[SPEAKER_01]: anything in the sky that night they're not
looking around are there any flying
[SPEAKER_01]: saucers folks?
[SPEAKER_01]: no the chief meteorologist said it is
possible a weak inversion set up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: valleys overnight as the valley locations
are more prone to the diurnal day night
[SPEAKER_01]: effects of the Sun but I think that the
cloud cover would have prevented any
[SPEAKER_01]: radiational cooling in the valley so there
wasn't any inversion that's what the chief
[SPEAKER_01]: meteorologist said and as things went on
and we haven't mentioned that but we did
[SPEAKER_01]: mention you've gone down there seen the
car witnessed it so personal experience
[SPEAKER_01]: etc ten days later about Betty began to
have nightmares had five of them they
[SPEAKER_01]: included a conscious memory of a close
encounter with the UFO she also dreamed of
[SPEAKER_01]: an abduction by the craft's occupants I
think you're all aware that sometimes the
[SPEAKER_01]: events of our daytime life show up in our
dreams there's something was going on here
[SPEAKER_01]: but Betty being Betty she recorded the
dreams she kept a record of them now
[SPEAKER_01]: remember Barney worked nights Betty worked
days let's look at the next okay now the
[SPEAKER_01]: event took place in 1961 September okay
Barney developed some ulcers some problems
[SPEAKER_01]: health problems went to a doctor you know
got to take care of the ulcer problem got
[SPEAKER_01]: blood pressure problems and the doctor
told Barney that look I've done all I can
[SPEAKER_01]: for you with conventional medicine
something else is going on here he
[SPEAKER_01]: recommended that they see a psychiatrist
because you remember back then ulcers were
[SPEAKER_01]: thought to be caused by mental stress and
if you could control the stresses you
[SPEAKER_01]: could take care of the ulcers to some
extent to make a long story short he wound
[SPEAKER_01]: up in the office of doctor they wound up
dr. Benjamin Simon now Benjamin Simon
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know a darn thing about UFOs but he
was a world-class expert on helping people
[SPEAKER_01]: uncover hidden memories if you will is
specifically dealing with World War two
[SPEAKER_01]: shell-shocked war veterans that's what
they used to call it today it's
[SPEAKER_01]: post-traumatic stress disorder well you
know your buddy's head gets blown off next
[SPEAKER_01]: to you it's a little hard to integrate
that into your life you know why me not or
[SPEAKER_01]: him not me and how do I live with that and
you know these are different people are
[SPEAKER_01]: coming back from Iraq or Afghanistan with
these things and so dr. Simon actually ran
[SPEAKER_01]: a hospital with 3,000 beds for
shell-shocked war veterans yeah the
[SPEAKER_01]: greatest success of any of the
psychiatrists it's never a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd better add not everybody is able to
get back to a normal life but he even
[SPEAKER_01]: stars in a movie let there be light that
the army made showing his techniques that
[SPEAKER_01]: he had developed using regressive hypnosis
somebody who was blind was able to see
[SPEAKER_01]: again we're not talking mythical stories
here the army wanted these people get back
[SPEAKER_01]: to living again and dr. Simon was the best
equipped probably of anybody around who
[SPEAKER_01]: could have had the chore of trying to
uncover what happened he was down in
[SPEAKER_01]: Boston and he conducted his sessions each
separately not together and induced
[SPEAKER_01]: amnesia at the end of each session two
purposes they couldn't remember it
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves and they couldn't talk to the
other one about it he was taping all these
[SPEAKER_01]: sessions and eventually played back the
tapes to them together and his whole
[SPEAKER_01]: purpose was to get the feelings out and
have them relive these experiences so he
[SPEAKER_01]: could show them they're okay now they can
live with it the truth shall set you free
[SPEAKER_01]: something I don't know who said that I
don't know who said that but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: matter so Ben Simon was not an expert on
flying saucers and in listening the tapes
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes you get the feeling why didn't
he ask him this that or the other thing
[SPEAKER_01]: well he wasn't interested in the saucer
part of the story he was interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: helping two obviously sensible sensitive
intelligent people get their lives back
[SPEAKER_01]: after what was clearly a strange
experience that was disturbing to them so
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't the next week the next month it
wasn't Carl Sagan did an article which
[SPEAKER_01]: made it sound like there was one hypnosis
session where they came up with this cock
[SPEAKER_01]: and bull story nonsense and as a matter of
fact we have it in writing that the
[SPEAKER_01]: emotional intensity in one session each
was greater than that in the voices of any
[SPEAKER_01]: of the military guys that dr. Simon had
worked with he had to stop those sessions
[SPEAKER_01]: he was afraid they couldn't handle it the
terror is quite clear and I mentioned this
[SPEAKER_01]: because you'll hear people saying what was
it I said Betty didn't get excited it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like she was taking a stroll in the
supermarket it sure doesn't come across
[SPEAKER_01]: that way when you listen to the tape
Barney is terror-stricken and remember
[SPEAKER_01]: there had been no abduction cases that had
been publicized so there's nothing to draw
[SPEAKER_01]: upon about what happened here if you're
being abducted by somebody are you going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get back what's going to happen to you
is your life going down the drain while
[SPEAKER_01]: these guys get when they get finished with
you they throw you away what you know so
[SPEAKER_01]: there's an eight terror aside from their
having you under their control and doing
[SPEAKER_01]: physical examinations and other stuff
which none of us are nobody wants to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: specimen which is how they were treated
fair enough statement yes so he was quite
[SPEAKER_01]: a remarkable guy and it's important to
recognize that this was a real expert not
[SPEAKER_01]: in flying saucers but in helping people
get through difficult experiences and as
[SPEAKER_01]: they're reliving this experience they
realize that remember that business about
[SPEAKER_01]: the orb they saw this light in the road
and some men around it and stuff that they
[SPEAKER_01]: remembered that consciously not very
clearly now they're going over it and when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're up in that country the the trees
are tall the road is narrow no lights
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept driving and driving and I made a
turn and I never knew this I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: why I had to make that turn as I say when
you stand at the spot where he first sees
[SPEAKER_01]: the leader through the binoculars you get
the very strong feeling that he was being
[SPEAKER_01]: directed where to go and the place they
wound up was the only place in the area
[SPEAKER_01]: where you could set down a large saucer
empty lot I'll call it sandy area this is
[SPEAKER_01]: very heavily forested land and at night
it's dark out there I'll tell you that the
[SPEAKER_01]: sand is kind of whitish so he was there
because they wanted him there and from the
[SPEAKER_01]: air of course you could see where it could
just set down a saucer where could you
[SPEAKER_01]: bring a car in and so forth and so on
there's the comment when Betty was talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about her dreams I saw 8 to 11 men
standing in the middle of the road the men
[SPEAKER_01]: surrounded the car we sat motionless
that's what she said let's listen to the
[SPEAKER_03]: description then I thought well you know
are they in a car and the car broke it
[SPEAKER_03]: down or what are we doing there?
[SPEAKER_03]: and Vanico said to stop and then he he
stopped the car and these men started to
[SPEAKER_03]: come up to the car they they separated
they came up in two groups and when they
[SPEAKER_03]: started to do that I I get real scared
yeah the the count of the died the cast
[SPEAKER_03]: off and when they started coming up Bonnie
tried to start the car he tried to start
[SPEAKER_03]: it and you know how a motor of a car would
just turn over and turn over and won't
[SPEAKER_03]: fire and he stopped the car and he started
the car and it won't start and then they
[SPEAKER_03]: started coming towards us and I think well
I can't get away from this I guess if I
[SPEAKER_03]: get the car door off like a brother of the
witches I'd and I'm thinking that I just
[SPEAKER_03]: put my hand on the car door and open it
and just and they come up and they open it
[SPEAKER_03]: for me and they open the car door and
there's and there's not anything there and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's blacked out and one man puts his
hands out I don't know what happened did
[SPEAKER_07]: that sound like a trip to the grocery
store to you?
[SPEAKER_07]: the emotional level of a trip to the
grocery store for a woman who's normally
[SPEAKER_01]: very even toned this is not an excitable
woman now in Betty's dreams remember she
[SPEAKER_07]: dreamed that there were eight to eleven
men they surrounded the car and she and
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney sat motionless you just saw that
under hypnosis that's not what happened
[SPEAKER_07]: there were three who came to her door
let's see what Barney described
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I saw a cluster of six men
because three came to me and three did not
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't think of the man in the sky said
he didn't think of the man in the sky at
[SPEAKER_07]: that time well as you can see Barney said
that three approached him as well that's
[SPEAKER_07]: not what Betty had in her dreams there's
evidence there that what happened might
[SPEAKER_07]: have been a real event they both made the
same statements correlating data under
[SPEAKER_07]: hypnosis that was not in her dreams the
point is some people said there was no
[SPEAKER_01]: event it was just Betty's dream that was
the whole story that what came out under
[SPEAKER_01]: hypnosis was just Betty's dreams and
Barney picked it up from Betty and we got
[SPEAKER_01]: no problem here it's just you know wishful
thinking the reality comes out quite
[SPEAKER_01]: different from that and Barney could as
they each one was grabbed by three people
[SPEAKER_01]: three beings and Barney could feel the top
of his feet bumping against the stones
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where that scuffed shoes came from
this is the sandy area they're being
[SPEAKER_01]: transported in clothes separately three
with Barney three with Betty his eyes were
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much closed they were under control
you want to keep your specimens from
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting back in other words nobody stuck
a needle in them they wanted them
[SPEAKER_01]: conscious presumably so they could do what
they were told to do when they were being
[SPEAKER_01]: tested but that's where the shoe problem
seems to have come from you know think of
[SPEAKER_01]: them sort of hanging a little bit and
being dragged with his feet behind them on
[SPEAKER_07]: the ground Barney stated that he felt as
if he were floating somehow that his arms
[SPEAKER_07]: were extended outward and that he could
just feel the toes of his shoes bumping
[SPEAKER_07]: along those rocks and then sliding along a
smooth surface and bumping over a surface
[SPEAKER_01]: at the top a ramp we'll call it a ramp
anyway Betty was feisty she was trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: kick these people she wasn't going to be
taken willingness willingly into whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: it was they wanted to do with her but so
three guys on each of them managed to get
[SPEAKER_01]: them up this ramp over a kind of lintel
I'll call it a doorway kind of base and
[SPEAKER_01]: they were taken into separate rooms
remember this is a clear area here the
[SPEAKER_01]: only space in the area we could put down
this darn saucer right next to this narrow
[SPEAKER_01]: road where they were grabbed somebody was
paying attention and planning and when
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty struggled at the bottom of this ramp
it's probably the point at which she tore
[SPEAKER_07]: out the lining of her dress and tore down
her hem much more sensible and she's
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting in the car and suddenly these
things happen Barney later drew this
[SPEAKER_01]: picture of what things look like on board
he had a compass you know he was up this
[SPEAKER_01]: way into a room there was a table and
cabinet this was a circular craft with
[SPEAKER_01]: pie-shaped room wedges you know going
around it they were not in the same rooms
[SPEAKER_01]: for their examination neither one was
witness to what was going on with the
[SPEAKER_01]: other one
[SPEAKER_07]: some people have said that Betty recalled
aliens who look very different from the
[SPEAKER_07]: ones that Barney recalled they're getting
Betty's dreams confused with Betty's
[SPEAKER_07]: hypnotic recall this is what the beings
looked like in Betty's dreams they looked
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot like Jimmy Durante southern European
looking dark thick hair dark eyebrows
[SPEAKER_07]: human ears human eyes large noses lips
that had a bluish tint and a kind of a
[SPEAKER_07]: grayish skin and they were dressed in blue
cadet type uniforms in her dreams but this
[SPEAKER_07]: is what Betty and Barney described and
remembered during the hypnosis sessions
[SPEAKER_07]: that they had with Dr. Simon and this is a
drawing done by New Hampshire artist David
[SPEAKER_07]: Baker he actually painted this in
watercolors and this was the rendition of
[SPEAKER_07]: the leader now David Baker did his
drawings based upon his knowledge of human
[SPEAKER_07]: anatomy so they might be slightly
different from what Betty and Barney
[SPEAKER_07]: observed Betty and Barney said though that
they had large chest cavities it was
[SPEAKER_07]: almost as if they had barrel chests
completely round rather than being wider
[SPEAKER_07]: this way and thinner this way there was a
membrane that covered their mouths and
[SPEAKER_07]: this membrane fluttered when they spoke to
each other in this kind of humming or
[SPEAKER_07]: buzzing sound but Betty and Barney
understood them in English although they
[SPEAKER_07]: never saw their mouths move when they were
communicating with Betty and Barney
[SPEAKER_07]: telepathy to me anyway they had large
slanted eyes which Betty and Barney said
[SPEAKER_07]: they had sort of square sides and Betty
thought they had a vertical cat-like slit
[SPEAKER_07]: for a pupil and they both said that the
iris almost completely filled up the eye
[SPEAKER_07]: and there was a little bit of yellow
around the edges so what you see in David
[SPEAKER_07]: Baker's painting is a little bit different
from what Betty and Barney actually
[SPEAKER_07]: described in their written account the
leader was approximately five feet tall
[SPEAKER_07]: and let's take a look now at the examiner
this is more what Betty and Barney
[SPEAKER_07]: actually described this painting was done
by New Mexico artist Patrick Richard and
[SPEAKER_07]: he was actually a friend of Betty when he
lived in New Hampshire the examiner looked
[SPEAKER_07]: about the same as the leader only they
said he or she had a weaker chin they
[SPEAKER_07]: weren't sure if this was a male or female
it was approximately four and a half feet
[SPEAKER_07]: tall communicated in English again they
were all dressed in black tight-fitting
[SPEAKER_07]: shiny clothing and in Barney's original
reports to Walter Webb back in October of
[SPEAKER_07]: 1961 he described shiny black uniforms
they Betty later described long narrow
[SPEAKER_07]: palms and very long fingers maybe four or
five she wasn't sure which this is a side
[SPEAKER_07]: view a sketch by David Baker and there was
a being on board that Betty and Barney
[SPEAKER_07]: didn't reveal to the public they were
asked not to talk about this particular
[SPEAKER_07]: one by the scientists who were studying
their case this is the one I call the
[SPEAKER_07]: supervisor because this little being stood
out in the dark hallway looking in at
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty as she was being examined and
frightened her terribly he was about three
[SPEAKER_07]: and a half feet tall he resembled the
others in a sense but he was different at
[SPEAKER_07]: the same time his head was larger in
proportion to the size of his body than
[SPEAKER_07]: the leader and the examiner and he had
this very dark irises in his eyes he had a
[SPEAKER_07]: broad flat nose and a wide thin mouth and
he was very hostile and threatening at the
[SPEAKER_07]: end this was the one that took the book
away from Betty if you're familiar with
[SPEAKER_07]: the story there was a book that she wanted
to keep that she found on the craft it
[SPEAKER_07]: wasn't didn't look like our books but it
was like a book and he was the one who saw
[SPEAKER_07]: it and she told me that he was almost
screaming when he saw that she had that
[SPEAKER_07]: book and then it was taken away from her
she had asked for something to take with
[SPEAKER_01]: early on to prove that this event had
happened and she saw the book grabbed it
[SPEAKER_01]: and she's getting ready to leave and this
blankety blank is telling me no you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: take it with you I remember you won't
remember there was a nasty scene there
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty and Barney said that their physical
examinations involved an examination of
[SPEAKER_07]: their skeletal structures these beings
seem to be very interested in the
[SPEAKER_07]: difference between human skeletons and
their own whatever that might be Betty and
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney noted that they seemed oddly
jointed and when they walked they walked
[SPEAKER_07]: very differently from us it was almost as
if they were gliding or stumbling along or
[SPEAKER_07]: almost skating it's really hard to
describe they examined Betty's and
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney's hands their feet they took their
shoes off they examined their joints to
[SPEAKER_07]: see how human joints moved they looked
into their eyes they scraped their skin
[SPEAKER_07]: they looked into their mouths there were
reproductive experiments done probably a
[SPEAKER_07]: needle was placed in Betty's navel and the
cup was placed over Barney's groin many
[SPEAKER_07]: specimens were taken from all of the
orifices in their bodies and this is Betty
[SPEAKER_07]: on the examining table painting done by
Patrick Richard again and the needle in
[SPEAKER_07]: the navel experiment and I want to play
for you now Betty's description under
[SPEAKER_03]: hypnosis so then they roll me over on my
back
[SPEAKER_03]: and the examiner has a long needle in his
hand and I see the needle and it's the
[SPEAKER_03]: silliest of any needle I've ever seen and
I ask him what he's going to do with it
[SPEAKER_03]: and he said just as this will test his own
heartbeat and I ask him what and he said
[SPEAKER_03]: he just wants to put it in my navel it's
just a simple test I tell him no I won't
[SPEAKER_03]: have don't do it don't do it and he said
no I won't have and he takes a nap in my
[SPEAKER_03]: navel and I'm crying and I tell him it's
hurting it's hurting it's hurting it's
[SPEAKER_03]: hurting it's not the needle he goes over
and he puts his hand right in front of my
[SPEAKER_03]: eyes and he says I'll be all right I won't
feel it
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the pain goes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a simple walk in the supermarket,
you can tell that.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a session in which Dr. Simon had
to end the session early due to the
[SPEAKER_07]: emotional intensity.
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't want to cause Betty to relive
any further trauma during that session.
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, that was before the
development of amniocentesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did say it was a pregnancy test,
which didn't make any sense at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife has had amniocentesis,
the needle in the navel routine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody was doing it at this time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I have another tape that I want to
play before Stan talks to you again.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's play this.
[SPEAKER_03]: He went over across the room to the head
of the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he did something.
[SPEAKER_03]: He opened up and wasn't like a drawer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did something in the metal of the wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an opening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he pulled out a map.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he asked me, had I ever seen a map
like this before?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I walked across the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I leaned against the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I looked at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a map for it was an all-brown
map.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't square.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a lot wider than it was long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were always dots on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would get it all over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some were a little, just pinpoints and
others where as big as a nickel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were, on some of the dots,
there were curved lines going from one dot
[SPEAKER_03]: to another.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was one big circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had a lot of lines coming out from
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of lines going to another circle,
quite close but not as big.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these were heavy lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I asked him what they meant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, he said that the heavy lines
were trade routes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other lines,
[SPEAKER_03]: the solid lines were places they went
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said that the bulging lines were
expeditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I asked him, where was his home port?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, where are you on this map?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I looked and I laughed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he said, well then, if you don't know
where you are, there wouldn't be any point
[SPEAKER_03]: of my telling you where I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wise guy alien is all I can say.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was preceded by Betty asking him
where they were from and saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're not from around here,
the understatement of the month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when he showed her this map.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this was followed by, Dr. Simon is
listening to this under hypnosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is reliving.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not retelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he asked Betty, I mean, you can
imagine how Dr. Simon felt.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a sensible person telling him a
story about trade routes and occasional
[SPEAKER_01]: expeditions and where is this all coming
from?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he asked Betty if she can remember
what the map looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: She says yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he gives her a post-hypnotic
suggestion.
[SPEAKER_01]: If and only if she can remember it
accurately, please draw it later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she does.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes home and she draws it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And base stars and trade routes and
occasional expeditions, how the heck are
[SPEAKER_01]: you going to make any sense out of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a galaxy has 200 billion stars in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no points of reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might suggest that the Earth was on
there or the sun was on here somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But beyond that, we'll never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seemed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until a brilliant woman named Marjorie
Fish did something nobody else had ever
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: She built 26 different three-dimensional
models of our local galactic neighbor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Marjorie.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did have black hair a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was in the early 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a school teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: She built these models.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her whole point was to see if she could,
she had visited Betty and gotten more
[SPEAKER_01]: information, to see if she could find a
three-dimensional pattern that matched the
[SPEAKER_01]: two-dimensional drawing that Betty had
drawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: She thought she'd find many matches.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, she didn't find any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, her models were limited by
information on how the distance to the
[SPEAKER_01]: stars and how many you can put in a model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out about 50 light years was the most you
could get in a cube kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: She expected to find many matches.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't find any using all the stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then she started cutting back on which
stars she showed, getting to the kind that
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists then said were the ones that
ought to have planets in life,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all stars would be expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might be too old, too new,
have another star too close, all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, when she got some good distance
data, the astronomers aren't going
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care how far away the stars
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need two angles to find a star.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's 20 light years away or 40
light years away doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're trying to get a
three-dimensional pattern of where things
[SPEAKER_01]: come from, the distances matter entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: When a new catalog came out, the finally
Wilhelm Gleesy New Catalog of Nearby Star
[SPEAKER_01]: Distances, you heard the word Gleesy three
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was talk about a planet 581G,
Gleesy 581G.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the same Gleesy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The star is 581.
[SPEAKER_01]: The G refers to the fifth planet,
I guess it's fifth or sixth planet around
[SPEAKER_01]: that star.
[SPEAKER_01]: This may be in the Goldilocks zone and may
have planets in life and all this may have
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, she finally found one and only one
pattern that matched angle for line,
[SPEAKER_01]: angle line length for line length,
what Betty had drawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of her models.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of those beads stands for a
particular star in its proper
[SPEAKER_01]: three-dimensional location.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had help from the staff at O'Hare
State University Astronomy Department,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Mitchell.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in my movie UFOs Are Real,
saying how accurate her work was.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a school teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a member of MENSA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brilliant objective person Marjorie was.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the identity of those stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: The distances then aren't quite accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hipparchos satellite has made millions
of measurements of better distances
[SPEAKER_01]: finally.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun is up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the important thing, our star.
[SPEAKER_01]: The base star is Zeta 1 and Zeta 2
reticuli.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the constellation of reticulum,
which means the net.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't see it from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to go down to the southern
hemisphere to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two stars are very special.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the closest to each other pair of
sun-like stars in our entire local
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our star, the sun, is out in the
boondocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next star over, 4.3 light years away.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two stars from each other are only
an eighth of a light year apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 30 times closer to each other than
we are to the next star over.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're out in the boonies.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys got next to our neighbors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those two stars are at least a billion
years older than the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: A billion years.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that they're so close means from
a planet around one looking at the other,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's visible all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that billion years and that short
distance, there's plenty of time and more
[SPEAKER_01]: incentive to develop interstellar travel a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a next star neighbor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell because you're so close that
there's life of some kind around the other
[SPEAKER_01]: star, around the planets around the other
stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very exciting discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the SETI people will tell you,
we listened to those stars and we didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: get a signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: SETI really stands for Silly Effort to
Investigate to suggest that aliens are
[SPEAKER_01]: stuck at our level of radio communication
technology we've had for about 100 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use the slide rule anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt if aliens are using our
communication technology now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is your target if you want to go
someplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're only 39.3 light years away from
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's in the local neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now several special things.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the stars connected by lines are
sun-like stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only true of 5% of the stars in our
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's between 1,000 and 2,000 stars within
55 light years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep finding new small stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the pattern stars are sun-like even
though only 5% of the stars in the
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhood are sun-like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the sun-like stars in that very
well described hunk of space are part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chance of that being a coincidence are
1 in 10,000 to 1 in a million.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all in a plane, the stars
connected by lines, like slices of
[SPEAKER_01]: pepperoni on a pizza, big flat pizza,
as opposed to raisins in a big fat loaf of
[SPEAKER_01]: raisin bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes transport a lot easier when
you're in a plane.
[SPEAKER_01]: The planets in the solar system are in a
plane, amazingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very exciting, challenging work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very proud to have been the first to
publish about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was asked to help Marjorie by the head
of the Aerial Phenomena Research
[SPEAKER_01]: Organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I got involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met with her a couple of times,
three times, anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very exciting piece of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's one of the most objective people
I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here's that question about the book
that we mentioned earlier, about the nasty
[SPEAKER_01]: supervisor taking it away from her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what Betty said.
[SPEAKER_01]: The book seemed to be constructed of thin,
stiff, shiny plastic, maybe an inch thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tucks seemed to be embedded in the
plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in about six columns going down
with symbols.
[SPEAKER_01]: What those symbols mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we decode them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of those places where you wish
Dr. Simon had asked for more information,
[SPEAKER_01]: please.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was something different,
anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get back to the comparative analysis
I did on the hypnosis tapes, where I
[SPEAKER_07]: transcribed Betty's and Barney's
statements and lined them up and compared
[SPEAKER_07]: them to Betty's statements in her dream.
[SPEAKER_07]: And although I have several examples in
the book, I'm using only two examples here
[SPEAKER_07]: due to our time constraint.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in Betty's dream, she said,
that she and Barney returned to the car at
[SPEAKER_07]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_07]: They stood by the side of the car and they
watched the UFO leave.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then they entered the vehicle and they
took off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's go back.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not what happened on the hypnosis
tapes.
[SPEAKER_07]: On the hypnosis tapes, Barney was escorted
to the car first.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was placed in the driver's seat.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he sat on his gun.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was sitting there wondering where Betty
was.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he saw her coming down the path.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty had actually been back on the craft
arguing because she wanted to keep that
[SPEAKER_07]: book.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she was furious that it had been taken
away from her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was feisty.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the leader took her down the path
and she entered the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: She picked up her dog.
[SPEAKER_07]: The leader had told her that she could
stop.
[SPEAKER_07]: She could stand by the side of the car and
watch the craft leave.
[SPEAKER_07]: He thought it would be safe for them to do
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then she asked Barney to get out of the
car and watch the craft leave,
[SPEAKER_07]: which they did.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this was completely different from the
information that Betty had recorded in her
[SPEAKER_07]: dreams, indicating that it might have been
a real experience and not that Betty had
[SPEAKER_07]: simply repeated her dreams under hypnosis
and that Barney had somehow absorbed the
[SPEAKER_07]: information in Betty's dreams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Osmosis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And repeated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so after many attempts to find the
location, Dr. Simon had given a suggestion
[SPEAKER_01]: that they would find the location.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did find it in this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an aerial view.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a dark at night, lonely road,
no lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's now a house here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's sandy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they recalled the soil being sandy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the only place around that's like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the people who live in the house didn't
know about this being the place where this
[SPEAKER_01]: experience had taken place, incidentally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're out here, as we were at
night, in the dark, it's a closed in sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the trees are tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not little scrubby things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a unique location.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see looking around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There aren't any other places in the
woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a place for spectators,
in other words.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys who ran this show knew what they
were doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Betty standing on the site.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before the house was built, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went on home.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the distances on the map.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, 37 miles to Concord from here at 17,
47 miles to Portsmouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people have said, oh, they got lost on
mountain roads.
[SPEAKER_01]: There aren't many roads around the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kathy tried to get lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't succeed.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they had traveled along Route 3,
it would have been only 16 miles from the
[SPEAKER_07]: field, the close encounter field,
to Plymouth, New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they had traveled on Route 175,
it would have been 21 miles.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no way to account for that two
hours of missing time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were giving an idea of their
involvement in the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barney was on the Governor's Civil Rights
Commission, very active in politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Betty was active in politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got invited to the inauguration.
[SPEAKER_01]: of Lyndon Johnson, January 20,
1965.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Kathy here went with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: She got an invitation, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the point of this is, it's not to brag
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about upstanding citizens of
the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not people who were looking,
how can we make up a story and have a
[SPEAKER_01]: crummy book put out and make a lot of
money?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not what we're talking about here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were people who had everything to
lose and nothing to gain.
[SPEAKER_01]: by going public against their will.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Barney with Senator McIntyre of
New Hampshire at the inauguration.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's appointed to the New Hampshire State
Advisory Committee on Civil Rights
[SPEAKER_01]: Commission.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is respectability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember, those were difficult days in
the Civil Rights Movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may remember the early 60s,
there was a lot of foment, a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is them in 1965 with that first
newspaper article, which started the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: ball rolling, unfortunately or not,
whatever you want to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Through a violation of confidentiality and
against their will.
[SPEAKER_01]: The story is told in the book in great
detail, but there they are with Delcey in
[SPEAKER_01]: 1966.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had at that point agreed to tell the
full story.
[SPEAKER_07]: John Fuller had asked if he could write
the book about their experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: A well-known author.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sharp guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've looked at the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an agreement that Dr. Simon
would have final say on everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And boy, was he rough on Fuller.
[SPEAKER_01]: The papers are at Boston University
Archives, the original manuscript,
[SPEAKER_01]: Simon's comments on the manuscript.
[SPEAKER_01]: And boy, he made him tow the line.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the book, I also wrote two chapters on
the psychophysics experiments that Betty
[SPEAKER_07]: agreed to participate in with Robert Homan
and C.D.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jackson, who were two employees at IBM.
[SPEAKER_07]: Robert Homan was a writer and C.D.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jackson was a senior engineer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Betty had agreed to do psychophysics
experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call them in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try to call them in.
[SPEAKER_07]: With some limited success, you will see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty also went out.
[SPEAKER_07]: She was trying to vector in craft.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was a photograph taken years later
after Barney's death in 1969.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we don't really know what this is,
but Betty found it interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see the shape here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It hovered above her vehicle.
[SPEAKER_07]: This photograph is enlarged.
[SPEAKER_07]: On the original slide, there appears to be
someone standing in this window.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't show up well here.
[SPEAKER_07]: She also took this photograph of a fiery
orb.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know what that is either.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we've come to the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is our book, Captured,
the Betty and Barney Hill UFO.
