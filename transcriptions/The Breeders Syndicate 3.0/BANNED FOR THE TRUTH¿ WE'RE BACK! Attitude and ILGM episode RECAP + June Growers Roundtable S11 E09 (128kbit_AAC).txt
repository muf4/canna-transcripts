[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_04]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_04]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_04]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_04]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_04]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Matthew here with Thousandfold,
and we have a few friends with us that are
[SPEAKER_04]: also growers, and we've been gone for,
I guess, what will now be a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will probably recap on that as well
at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Real quick, I guess I'm just going to jump
into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us what's happened in the last couple
of weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those who don't know, we did a few
shows that we felt were really important
[SPEAKER_04]: for a lot of the newer growers or newer
seed buyers to understand what they were
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be looking at when they first
came online to buy seeds based on data and
[SPEAKER_04]: statistics and just what we see around.
[SPEAKER_04]: We chose two different sites, that being,
I could say it because I can't do
[SPEAKER_04]: anything, the Attitude, and I love growing
NJ.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even want to say that now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went through and we showed basically
what red flags are.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't really go after with the
Attitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't go after the Attitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went after, not even specific breeders,
just the biggest red flags we saw of some
[SPEAKER_04]: of the more popular breeders for new seed
growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, they just got flagged,
taken down, reported for drug dealing,
[SPEAKER_04]: which was just, you know, I mean,
we're a history and info show that happens
[SPEAKER_04]: to be about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we ended up uploading those on Vimeo,
but we did get strikes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's something.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why we have been down for a few
weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, you know, I wanted to do a quick
recap on it as far as like letting you
[SPEAKER_04]: guys know they're out there and we'll
include the links below.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're important episodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like just think about all the money that
we all spent as we got into this and how
[SPEAKER_04]: much of like after having some knowledge
and learning how much money was fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: wasted with this bullshit that's meant to
just completely screw you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, as important as it is,
and as many requests as we've got to do
[SPEAKER_04]: that, we tried and just didn't quite work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe in the future we'll try again,
but the whole idea was to show the site
[SPEAKER_04]: and show proof of it, evidence of it as
we're going through.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's really where they got us is by
showing their websites.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about what we're going to talk
about today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So today we have kind of similar to last
season where we invited on who was at
[SPEAKER_03]: Spindle, Big Earn, Local to talk about
what they've been growing, what they're
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for, what they found.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Sean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I call you Sean or two Sean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do I call you just Sean on the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just call me Sean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sean.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Screwston Scarecrow and we have
KT.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe to start us off, why don't you
guys introduce yourselves a bit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just tell us a bit about what,
you know, how long you've been growing
[SPEAKER_03]: for, what your growing experience has been
like, and maybe to tie it back a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit to what Matt was saying, maybe just as
a bonus, add in any anecdote about,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, early seed bank experiences
that you may have had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about we start with, let's go with
Sean since we just talked to Sean.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my first experience growing was back I
think in like 2008, 2009 when I was just
[SPEAKER_01]: getting out of high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prices of everything were just like,
we're so fucking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my friend's dad, he used to grow back
in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was like, oh, let's get in on this
and everything and put kind of me and his
[SPEAKER_01]: son in charge of looking up and finding
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We first started with bag seeds that were
coming from some friends that were getting
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff from either where they said Michigan
or Cowley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we kind of did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when that was kind of going all
right and producing decent plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: he kind of want us to look at seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember first looking and I was on
attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was like looking at Nirvana
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember looking through the stuff
that was kind of the cannabis cup winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there was like Cristal,
there was like Snow White, Blue Mystic,
[SPEAKER_01]: Black Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a couple others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern Bright and a few others that
we're like looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we ended up choosing Northern
Bright, Snow White, Blue Mystic,
[SPEAKER_01]: Cristal and a couple others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going good, but he would
always want to cut them at like five weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: and then not go through the actual like,
and then not even try and let things dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cause he was like, I got to get
everything sold in six weeks and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything like done five weeks sold in
six.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just like, and I didn't know why,
but I mean, he had a drug addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he ended up having us sell a bunch of
drugs for him after his son got him kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like blew up the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we ended up renting this big place,
this big nice house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had the whole basement that we're
starting up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his son, of course, like brought
people that weren't supposed to be over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his dad was like, fuck this,
tore everything down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like, then he was just like,
Oh here, you want to have a cell like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Roxy's or whatever that he's
getting prescribed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that turned in just bad to just
horrible decision after decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I finally got back into growing
in 2017 and was looking around and I
[SPEAKER_01]: started doing some more research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd always kind of pop in every here and
there just kind of reading things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I mean, I always wanted to really
get into growing and, and that's just what
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of just want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just have like, you know, whatever job,
you know, make some money and then just be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to grow and, you know, maybe have
like little auxiliary cash or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got back into it in like 2017,
started growing some of Bodhi stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew strawberry milk and then Stevie
Wonder, which was a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both were good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I first had my first
introduction with Appalachia with the
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of his first strains ever is one of
the earliest ones too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: William's wonder something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember exactly what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it was an appellate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it was the Appalachian,
the father, and then Stevie Wonder,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was like train wreck, blueberry,
something else to the snow Lotus father.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all those were really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, I started getting
some seeds from my friend who,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I would help out a little bit
here and there and he would show me a few
[SPEAKER_01]: different things and, and help me learn
about like a little bit of soil building
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and just different things like that
or tricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't really think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I finally got into I guess when
the blue bonnet lines came out,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really when I started getting some
of Matt seeds and grew, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the first drop of the, the like
pre-release of the blistering came out,
[SPEAKER_01]: I popped those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were, those were phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had like one that turned like blue,
um, but had like GMO structure and smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was like a perfect mixture of
the bonnet and GMO where, and then just
[SPEAKER_01]: like the, the taste translated and it
would just coated your mouth and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then from there, I got onto
blooper skunks when they were released.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I had wrist surgery in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I had wrist surgery, I had a cast
on and my whole arm was up past the elbow
[SPEAKER_01]: was immobilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I couldn't really do much for four
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was kind of just chilling and then
got into the blooper skunks, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: grew a bunch of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it your girlfriend hand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to, I had to make the other one
stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help me be ambidextrous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, so then grew out a few
different things, um, and in between there
[SPEAKER_01]: and now, um, the ones that are most
notable were.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to, we're going to get into
like what, like the more detailed stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: about what you found and like what you
liked.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I kind of just been going on since,
uh, consistently since 2017, other than
[SPEAKER_01]: when I had wrist surgery, I had like the,
the four month break.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that was 2020, like right before the
pandemic happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So luckily that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in a cast and it wasn't like
anything wasn't big deal, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was, uh, that's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's Kristen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well, I try, I tried to grow when I
was a teenager and, uh, that didn't work
[SPEAKER_02]: out because I didn't know what to do and
didn't have anybody to show me or anything
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but I started like actually harvesting
in 2011 and, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I wasted a bunch of money on seeds from
the attitude.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you get?
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you get?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you, I was, I was buying those
greenhouse when they were doing the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the circles with like five seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you poke a little hole out of the back
plat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The wax coated seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The colored white and black packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got this sativa lover pack or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up going back to bag seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, at that, like this time it was from,
you know, like, like decent weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to take a hiatus for a little bit
and, uh, you, you, you ended up going to
[SPEAKER_03]: bag seed over the greenhouse seed that you
bought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not just greenhouse, but greenhouse
was the ones I was banking on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I'm going legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No more of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like, I started realizing like,
man, the problem is that like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just popping like Mexican bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no fucking shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have, uh, HID lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was running off of those giant CFLs.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ones that were like the size of a
pineapple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that big.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no shot, uh, at like actually
harvesting anything besides a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: barracks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought, well, you know, it's
probably my seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably, you know, like I actually
got a book, started reading, got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, switchable, uh, metal halide,
HPS light and, um, bought what I thought
[SPEAKER_02]: were the most legit seeds that I could
get, which was greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cup winners, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cup winners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were, they were just so, I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they looked okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they had great advertising,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: They really did and still do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I liked the shirts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I just went to like bag seed from,
uh, I was, you know, transferring some
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff from, uh, a friend out in California
and I guess their spot seeded out and
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much everything was seeded for like
a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just started going through that stuff
and, uh, yeah, I didn't buy seeds again in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until, until I came back at a hiatus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was just kind of helping friends
grow since I couldn't at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I popped up a, finally was able
to pop up a two by four and do everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, veg, flour, even drying in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I had to do everything in that little
two by four.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was just buying them seeds from,
uh, um, what's it called?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, the hot chick and her dad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, uh, humble, humble seat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I mean, I assume that's who you mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, cause I, I had some,
cause I had still been collecting seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I, I didn't want to, cause when,
when I, when I got caught up and had to
[SPEAKER_02]: stop for a bit, like I, I started learning
that cloning isn't just about
[SPEAKER_02]: multiplication of like plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, actually, oh, Hey, this one was
better than the rest.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I didn't want to pop anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought would be super special with even
those packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were bullshit too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and then, uh, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: No offense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I found, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found the, the podcast started listening
and, um, yeah, I got some triangle choke
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds from a friend, uh, that he got from
one of those, one of those, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: shirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the shirt giveaway seed thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bad pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those found something I loved and I
haven't really stopped popping syndicate
[SPEAKER_02]: beans since.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the rest is history.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be getting into that and that'll be
fun because yeah, I know, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the other reason why I picked the three of
you is because yeah, all three of you are
[SPEAKER_03]: great growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been growing stuff from the crew
for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so look forward to hearing more about
that as we go on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before Kyle starts that avatar is my I
have to say second favorite, but that was
[SPEAKER_04]: one of my favorite dogs that I've ever
interacted with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was kind of like me and Kyle knew
who each other were before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, but like, I think that's
how we became friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Friends was through that dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's cool to see him there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's why I picked it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, go Kyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, I mean, I'm pretty much a newer
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, man, maybe five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well like screw I'm, I'm trying maybe
when I was a teenager, but I was been
[SPEAKER_00]: raising kids for, you know, that's
basically what I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but I've been waiting, I've been
around cannabis, you know, basically my
[SPEAKER_00]: whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've had family grow in Mendoz,
Sonoma, uh, some out in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, that's, uh, pretty much
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my first seed bank, uh, I don't really
didn't really need to deal with seed
[SPEAKER_00]: banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my first seeds were from a snow
hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've, I've really only dealt with,
uh, kind of that type of seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no real Dutch type stuff or
anything like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much in any seed banks or ones,
you know, that were, uh, Matt was helping
[SPEAKER_00]: out and that's how I got a lot of math
stuff is basically I was trying to ease,
[SPEAKER_00]: helping people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always thought that was a cool thing
that Matt always tries to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's, and through,
um, through my seeds, uh, through my
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, I started out with the rev.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do all TLO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's, that's how I found out about
snow high and Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Instagram and all that stuff,
the lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, that's basically it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually when I was, and actually when
I was a teenager, surprisingly how it
[SPEAKER_00]: worked out is, um, I, uh, we used to use
the, uh, uh, the red likes to do use,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, uh, nutrient spikes and a miracle grow
actually had them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was one of the things that I
actually did when I was a teenager.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I thought, Hey, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why, why do I want to feed it all the time
when I can just put it into the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: then just water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so once I found his philosophy,
uh, it just, everything fit for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I just been doing that and
there's no reason for me to change
[SPEAKER_00]: basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to just say, that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I remember you doing, um,
TLO cause, uh, bum cat from our discord
[SPEAKER_03]: community has actually been talking to me
about like a broad organics episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just have been struggling to think
of people to include.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe I'll, I'll, I'll be in touch with
you about that for some time in the
[SPEAKER_03]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause, uh, I'm getting as a, you know,
I'm not younger anymore and I do
[SPEAKER_00]: construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rev, uh, it's small containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, it's, it's, it's real easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a lot of heavy lifting type
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that fits my me because I do night
gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, you know, it's hard for me,
you know, to do a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes once I get home, you know,
especially once I, you know, like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: another job on top of another job
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that's never fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's not why I do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely do it for a passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's what I like to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well I've loosely divided this talk into
like three parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first part is kind of meant to be
like what you've grown in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the second part is like what you've
found and the third part is meant to be
[SPEAKER_03]: like, what else are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_03]: So more of the future in saying that,
I know it's obviously hard to talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: what you've grown without talking about
what you're looking for, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll, we'll do our best to, to see we can
kind of focus in these, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: from these different perspectives.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to start from what you've
grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know you guys have already sort of
touched on that, but we could bring it
[SPEAKER_03]: back to Sean because Sean was about to
tell us about, you know, blue Piscunx and
[SPEAKER_03]: all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some of the highlights Sean of
the things that you've grown?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and yeah, just, just kick it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I think at this point,
I also invite all of you to ask questions
[SPEAKER_03]: if you have any, um, to each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess some of my favorites that I
have grown so far have definitely been the
[SPEAKER_01]: blistering, um, the blooper skunk,
uh, the blue sour, the blue resin,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Santa Cruz wreck that, that stuff's
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I found like this, this blue,
um, bubble tape kind of Fino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then there was like one that
popped out that was just like this weird
[SPEAKER_01]: savory meat y rancid meaty kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, it was just weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't really know how to
explain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My nose kind of sucks too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm probably, so how someone else would
smell it, they would probably be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe that's not necessarily what it is or
they'd pick up other notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then also Paco Lolo's,
uh, sour skunk dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, that was one of my favorites of
the, the sour hybrids I've grown and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: grown out probably like 10, 10 different
ones, um, of just like the sours and the
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel hybrids over the past two or three
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really the blue sour, the Appalachian
diesel and the sour skunk dog would be my
[SPEAKER_01]: three that I would kind of just look
through the, to find something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I really loved the, the happy diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I grew up four plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one was all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other three, they're just like,
two were really close.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just really, really loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just, I could bring it into a room and
people would smell it immediately and kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of just ask like, what the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it would have this just burnt
rubber kind of just rotten mango funk to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that translate completely the taste
with the high that's just, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: hits you and, and it, you know,
makes you kind of, kind of dumb a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit, but it like keeps you awake and it
kind of just gets your mind off of things
[SPEAKER_01]: and numbs your body a little bit and just
kind of stays up in the head and doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really, uh, it doesn't really burn you out
too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you don't have like, like the crash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then the APF threes were good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're a little bit slower veg for me
than I prefer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but flavor wise, um, just really
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this one that was like a mango cam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it w I guess it was more kind of
trace dog, which is like the little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: green crack on the back end.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of gave it a little extra taste
and flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, then what else?
[SPEAKER_03]: The original Sean, actually just before
you go on, what, what led you to these
[SPEAKER_03]: particular packs with strains?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so that diesel representations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I kind of was looking for,
so I, I also grew out, I was looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: like banana tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I always kind of wanted to do like a
little bit of just growing some seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing things together that,
that I would like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was kind of going through,
through all like the diesels and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and sours and stuff like that,
trying to find a couple lines,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that I would really like that I
could then go back through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how I kind of go and purchase would
be, um, I, something I think would be like
[SPEAKER_01]: really good or should be, I may buy like a
couple packs, you know, for, but initially
[SPEAKER_01]: if I'm not too sure about, I'll buy a pack
and then grow it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I like it, then I'll, I'll buy a few
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, all those I've, I've ended up
going back and buying, buying more just
[SPEAKER_01]: because I want to end up using them for
making seeds for my own and, and trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just make something that I,
I could like, you know, uh, myself and
[SPEAKER_01]: just, you know, be happy that I made
something that I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I have, um, I went and got,
I, so the banana tie, I got some outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: from Cody, uh, Matt knows Cody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember it like undefeated or
can't remember whatever his answer is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he sent me some of the outdoor that was
just this like juicy fruit bubble gum that
[SPEAKER_01]: reminded me of some weed I had when I was
17.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and like I skipped school to go and
get and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and then the kid's dad comes home
and gets all pissed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we're like smoking weed in his
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like this, I don't know,
it was fun time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted the kind of, and then that
kind of brought the nostalgia,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this banana tie had just like the most
amazing high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just kinda just really racy,
but not like the ID inducing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which is, is, you know, what I really
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just the flavor and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like this juicy fruit bubble gum
with a little bit of a spiciness to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he also sent some shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just all juicy fruit bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like this was like 2000, 18 or 19.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was when your lives first started,
but it was right before, I guess it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, yeah, sometime like 18, 19.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then I wanted to, you know,
I got a pack from you, I think the last
[SPEAKER_01]: pack of F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to, you know, I'd find a
female to keep and then, uh, possibly use
[SPEAKER_01]: that or just really just to have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I took, I didn't end up finding a
female, so I ended up getting a male and I
[SPEAKER_01]: was like, all right, let's just see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ended up pollinating blue resin,
um, some Apocalypse Sour Skunk Dog,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, not so LA lemon tree, um,
not so LA, uh, TK from CSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else did I get?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, uh, cherry berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and those, and then I also hit the,
like I said, the blue resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I feel like there was like a couple
other things in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, I can't remember everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just didn't really interest me all
that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I've grown out the blue resin
banana tie and got some really nice,
[SPEAKER_01]: like creamy blue and blueberry lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ended up with some of the more
blueberry lemon ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up making some hash from some,
well, that was sitting around for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, four months during the hash came
out, blueberry lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been enjoying that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then the cherry berry banana tie
came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I only grew out three females.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a small pop just to see what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's like really nice,
dense, very resinous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of the three phenos were, um,
they're like a cherry lemon and just like
[SPEAKER_01]: this kind of like light green with more of
like a yarn, like a rust colored hair,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those ones were, are just really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've given some to some friends and
stuff to try out of them myself and they
[SPEAKER_01]: all seem to like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one was a purple pheno that,
uh, kind of was, was more of like the
[SPEAKER_01]: cherry berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it was purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm guessing that one was more,
um, cherry berry leaning, super frosty,
[SPEAKER_01]: the high actually, I enjoyed more of that
pheno and ended up smoking that one first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so really most of what I've bought and
things like that, I've kind of wanted to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to eventually find, run through things,
find things I like, and then kind of mix
[SPEAKER_01]: them together, um, and, and enhance them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enhance the, the, the ones that I find.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the banana tie doing that,
I was hoping to pass on, I was hoping the
[SPEAKER_01]: male would have the, you know,
the juicy fruit, um, terpene profile and
[SPEAKER_01]: pass that along, along with the effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that was my goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't really found the, you know,
the juicy fruit profile, but, and effect
[SPEAKER_01]: wise, I couldn't really tell you if it has
passed on very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from what I've grown out, I have
enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have, you know, seen the nuances and
flavor profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just need to go back to those seeds and
grow out more to really see what's there
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but like I said, you know,
I'm going from a male, I can't really,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it was, you know, using the female and
going, I would have a better idea of what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this, I was hoping, you know,
it would pass on certain things,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, and maybe at the other, uh,
four things I have that I haven't run yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: something will pop out of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but we'll see about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I guess, so of my,
my top, I guess, if I say the top three
[SPEAKER_01]: of, of the ones I have grown, I definitely
say original sin.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's, that one's, everybody loves
that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like what the crosses, uh,
it's Loompa, Loompa's headband,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, to Appy happy at three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's just like, I haven't grown
out Loompa headband, but I've seen it and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and seen what other people have said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like a more stocky and it's just
like this pine soul funk, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: with a little bit of like burnt rubber,
maybe in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some Finos that have,
that are like a little bit of mango in
[SPEAKER_01]: there instead of the, the pine soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those ones are just like really,
really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the potent, the potent and all of
them, um, I had four females all
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively close to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's probably what I,
or well, not probably, that is definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: what I've been smoking on the most,
um, recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and those I definitely want to look
through more and more, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I found four that I was, you know,
happy with flavor wise and effects with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I, I know I didn't keep any
because I have some work going on at the
[SPEAKER_01]: place I'm at right now and keeping me from
keeping anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then once the work's done,
I'm going to go back to, um, the ones I've
[SPEAKER_01]: really liked growing over the past,
you know, a few years and then look into
[SPEAKER_01]: there for keepers to, to then make some,
uh, some cool things with hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would also say I really loved
the Appie diesel and then the cherry
[SPEAKER_01]: berry, the cherry berries really,
really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but man, the blooper skunk and
blistering too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, um, the blooper skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of like kind of blue,
like just buttery blue phenos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some that were like, like really
skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got one that was like,
I don't know how to describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of like a blue, like sweet
tart kind of thing, or like an electric
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of blue thing that ended up turning a
little funky towards the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I would just describe it as best
as like, this is like electric blue funk
[SPEAKER_01]: and the taste was just mouth coating and
tip, you know, flavor just translated and
[SPEAKER_01]: had this just really, really nice,
mellow high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which I liked about a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I've seen tests and stuff and a lot
of people in there, they test high,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess maybe I, I smoke a good amount,
but they didn't like overpower me,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they, they did everything I wanted it
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, with wrist surgery,
my, my wrist is completely like this
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take my, um, ulna and move it up and
down still after surgery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do, uh, you know, uh, manual labor
and stuff for a living.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need, I need stuff that's going to
know, you know, fix with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, not to mention just other like torn
labrums and other injuries that I just,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the hell did you do to do all this
and boulders and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: moving those around and one slipped and
was about to fall in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grabbed it with my hand and just
like pulled my shoulder out of socket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, so I need stuff, you know,
that's gonna not necessarily, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: put me down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I liked this smoke throughout the
day as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking for things that will cover,
you know, the aches and pains,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and then, you know, maybe help with my
focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I have ADHD or not ADHD,
but I have just bad attention,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so I, you know, yeah,
I'm like bouncing around half the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it helps me, you know, focus down and
nail down tasks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, you know, I, I'm not trying to
be, but then at night, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why I like, you know, maybe the
original sin, um, that that's kind of my
[SPEAKER_01]: go-to after work that are, uh,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the Appalachian diesel is really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do also really like the,
the cherry berry, um, banana ties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I grew out the, the blue tents
from Pico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, those, those were nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all came out like just really nice
bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, really blueberry smelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had one that was kind of more,
uh, definitely looked more pushments,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of like, um, like a
blueberry lemon muffin kind of thing going
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean, those were, those were
good too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just as quick wheel testers from the
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, a lot of the freebies and
things that you give, I'll just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, give those a go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of those are great too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, no, no, not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, when you buy packs and stuff
from math, you know, yeah, that's what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me, yeah, I'll pause you there,
Sean, cause we are still, we're still
[SPEAKER_03]: going to go into what you found later on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can like, you know, maybe think
about what else you found, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: for the next part.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing I've noticed is no,
the other thing I've noticed is that,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, the three of you will have some
overlaps in what you've grown and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be quite cool to talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe Sean, if I pause you there and
move us on to Kyle, cause you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: get to come back again anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kyle, do you want to speak to,
I know you've done some banana tie stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I, am I wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no, actually, yeah, no, I have,
uh, yeah, that's actually my, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the one thing I'll make sure I never lose
is the one, my number one from this one's,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, yeah, it's the juicy fruit or I fruit
stripe for, you know, uh, old school
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always, yeah, the fruit stripe,
even though now it's gone, but I still,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how I refer to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's, it's a, it's a three,
four hour high for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I can smoke, it's a no ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just keep smoking, get higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, it's just, it's for me,
it's just, I've, I've tested it pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get it to do her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty, I want to do work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying, I tried my first reverse
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't know, I don't think anything
took, but you know, that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I only did one plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew, I knew failure was pretty,
uh, a hundred percent actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured with one plan, but I figured I
had one ready and I just threw it in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, uh, to see what would happen type
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I also have another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, out of the pack, I got five and I
got a pretty good, um, expressions,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially from what Matt has seen
pictures of, uh, end up getting a cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: and cream one, uh, a few that were kind of
more of the dad, uh, from what the
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's the ones that, yeah,
that's the ones that you really like as
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pictures are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely, uh, the high was,
it was okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, wasn't there what I wanted and the
turps, it was just kind of the blend it,
[SPEAKER_00]: when the ones that have stuff gets
muddled, it's just, it's kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's bland ones inside that banana tie.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the thing like there,
there's been, um, expressions in there
[SPEAKER_04]: that I've definitely considered just
straight bland.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know if it's just the
cookies that mutes it all, but it just
[SPEAKER_04]: goes bland.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of them like cardboard bland,
but yeah, even though it's really,
[SPEAKER_00]: they smell really good tropical mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's nothing that was like banana
or anything to mix, but then, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: once you smoke it, it was kind of,
yeah, just nothing no Turkey wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, it's always the effect I can
get beyond turps because I'm really old
[SPEAKER_00]: school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've smoked a lot of, a lot of bad,
bad in my, in my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like smoking since, uh,
uh, basically I was nine, uh, since
[SPEAKER_00]: paraquat bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically we're talking early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking, I definitely smoked some
bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, Hey man, go get some to
drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, if I really have to just get over
it, but, uh, yeah, I just really liked the
[SPEAKER_00]: banana tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just plan on working that and
keeping it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What, what other stuff have you grown in
the past that you, you know, you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: highlight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, my first thing I ever did
before, I actually didn't get the snow
[SPEAKER_00]: high seats first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he took a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause, uh, he was waiting on whatever I
had actually had ordered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually had got a CSI and it was a
sweet pig stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my very first grow line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did three of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I don't think I was the best,
obviously my first crow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking back at the pictures,
especially I'm like, Ooh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's probably why I didn't enjoy it so
much, but I still have had that pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but then, uh, I did some perfect
pearls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoyed those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, those were ones of the few that,
uh, actually my wife, she doesn't actually
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke, but, uh, she always smells of pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's very sensitive to anything pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically everything just smells weed
pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, those are ones she actually says,
uh, and she remembers, uh, was sugary,
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the ones that are hard to
describe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you spell out what's perfect pearl?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's it from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so that's from a souvenir,
uh, Seiko, uh, and that's the silver pearl
[SPEAKER_00]: S ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were his first release.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you know, obviously I found out
through Matt, obviously Instagram and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I got those as soon as they were
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I think that was through the
seed bank at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I popped on those really fast as soon
as they came up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, that's one of my favorite cuts
that I've ever grown was that silver pearl
[SPEAKER_04]: cut that he used to make the S ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where I sourced it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, see what else, uh,
everything else is kind of just a random
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really kept anything,
uh, too special.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some people, uh, I've grown,
I'm not going to mention names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, there's certain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just won't like the certain seed banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, for me, I just won't give them,
uh, I just, I just don't mention names.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just, you know, they're not worth
the time type of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, let's see what else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe one thing I can ask you,
Kyle, is, uh, did you have a sense of what
[SPEAKER_03]: you were looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well for me, uh, I think I was
thinking recently that I think I was
[SPEAKER_00]: searching for everything because,
uh, it was just, this is such a password
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never grew that I have so much now
that I don't really know if I ever have to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy anything anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to start kind of looking through
what I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and just maybe, yeah, well I am making
my own, I may make my own stuff because I
[SPEAKER_00]: know there's certain stuff that people,
uh, basically what I look for is if
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's doing one thing, I go the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know, you know, right now,
uh, everybody's kind of going the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry and the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now I probably wouldn't be going
blueberry type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started looking in the opposite
direction because that's just,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just how it was, how I've been for
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of do the opposite of what
everybody's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, yeah, it's kind of, you know,
but we're all going to see pictures of
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry and so very, very soon and
that's all we're going to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Matt's going to be very happy,
but you know, yeah, the other notable be
[SPEAKER_00]: right now would be the sweet pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I did get those seeds secondhand,
not, not actually through, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the person who made them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he wants to be mentioned
cause I know he's not an actual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never know if he, cause I know he
doesn't actually, uh, sell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, so one of the other people
I don't like to talk about either,
[SPEAKER_04]: like pretty much took credit for all that
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause bitter doesn't say anything,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, uh, same thing with the tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already put that through pretty much
a good, the pace and it hasn't done
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for me to get it to be mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I plan, I like to mix that with the
time because, uh, people will say that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's the mental camphor nutty thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get that from mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine is kind of more just what I describe
as hashy, which is just a bland.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no real flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, uh, to me, resin, uh,
which I think would be good with the tie
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's just going to get,
I would think more, more resin because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the sweet pea is pretty resinous and that
everybody likes the pictures and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, maybe a little bit of structure,
but that I'm not too, too worried about,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think the mix would be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the high, I think it would be
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it could be more intense,
uh, with the legs is what I, what I would
[SPEAKER_00]: think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I would be searching for.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Kristen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, uh, I really like the, what I found
in the triangle choke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and what's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's triangle choke?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's, uh, TK by diesel and then
pollinated to the blue bonnet pollinated
[SPEAKER_02]: by the blue bonnet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sorry, just to, just to know,
obviously we all know what these,
[SPEAKER_03]: these strains are, but I'm making you guys
spell it out for the audience.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, I liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got the five seed pack, just the
promo pack, uh, before they were sold
[SPEAKER_02]: just, uh, from my buddy who got one of
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: The shirts they were, did I ever sell
those on the site?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I did them on the side eventually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You did at one point because you realized
that, um, people were interested.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and like that was just out of two
females.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bought two more packs of those and
then earned gave me two packs of those
[SPEAKER_02]: that he got as a freebie, um, that I'm
going to be going through here soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's good stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What else have you been going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the, uh, I really liked the stone day,
what we found in this stone day that,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, my buddy actually bought that pack,
um, and popped them and gave me clones so
[SPEAKER_02]: that I could help him like keep it alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I ran them too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we found in it was, is so fucking
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I mean, three of the four females
could easily have been kept just depending
[SPEAKER_02]: on like preference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, the one that we, you know,
three of us grew them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of like passed around jars and
stuff like that throughout our little
[SPEAKER_02]: friend group here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, yeah, we all kind of picked the
one that was very much like, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: like rotten.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mango.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was gorilla glue Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Extremely resonance, um, potent and like a
really good quality of high, not just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like a one note high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Red spectrum high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like the smoke was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously it looked really good,
uh, probably because of the gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, can I ask you, I don't know if you
want to speak to this and we can like clip
[SPEAKER_03]: this out if you don't, but I know that
you've got like a little crew of friends
[SPEAKER_03]: who actually like, you guys kind of do
grows, not grows together, but like you
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of, um, you guys are doing some
collaborative stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the same things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to talk to us about some of
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so like, I mean, we're all just like,
you know, mostly we're all just dads,
[SPEAKER_02]: like growing pot, uh, on our own before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, some people, you know,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been friends with some people,
one dude I met actually on the syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and we all just kind of pass out jars,
like from, from our harvest to each other
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we can all kind of like check out
what we're, you know, what other lines are
[SPEAKER_02]: like and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, one of my buddies, uh,
grew and chopped.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's growing out the Evie happy and the
Evie by blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's electric Boogaloo, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's also known as dog shit for
those that don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's looking through those,
hoping to find, you know, like a good one
[SPEAKER_02]: out of each.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm looking through the shoreline
by Appy and shoreline by Santa Cruz blue
[SPEAKER_02]: dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can kind of cover more, you know,
basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And find cool shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think that's so cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's, it's the, it's the kind of
thing that like, uh, we dream of more
[SPEAKER_03]: people doing, I think in the community,
just like share, like pulling your
[SPEAKER_03]: resources and time essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have, uh, like a little bit of
like a geographic advantage just cause our
[SPEAKER_02]: city is so big, you know, like there's
bound to be a lot of people in it that are
[SPEAKER_02]: growing pot, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, it was, it was just kind of like
finding each other, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the hard part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to find people to trust in,
in any city, you know, to that degree,
[SPEAKER_04]: trusting with your family and livelihood.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah.
